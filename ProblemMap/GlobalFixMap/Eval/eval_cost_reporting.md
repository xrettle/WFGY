This page defines how to measure and report **cost per correct answer** in retrieval-augmented and reasoning pipelines. Latency and accuracy alone are insufficient. Without cost analysis, systems regress into wasteful configurations.

## Open these first

* Latency vs Accuracy trade-off: [eval\_latency\_vs\_accuracy.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Eval/eval_latency_vs_accuracy.md)
* Benchmark suite: [eval\_benchmarking.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Eval/eval_benchmarking.md)
* Observability probes: [alerting\_and\_probes.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Eval_Observability/alerting_and_probes.md)

---

## Acceptance targets

* **Cost per correct answer** ≤ 1.3× baseline
* **Cost stability variance** ≤ 15% across 3 seeds and 3 paraphrases
* **Token efficiency** ≥ 0.7 (fraction of tokens contributing to correct citation)
* **Budget alerting**: auto-flag when projected monthly spend > 110% of budget cap

---

## Reporting dimensions

Each evaluation run must record cost on three levels:

1. **Raw tokens**

   * input, output, total per query
   * broken down by retrieval, rerank, reasoning

2. **Cost per unit**

   * \$/1k tokens per provider and model
   * normalized into `usd_equiv`

3. **Cost per correct**

   * (total spend ÷ number of correct answers)
   * stratified by question bucket (short, medium, long)

  "cost_per_correct": 0.00056,
  "variance_across_runs": 0.11,
  "notes": "within budget and stable"
}
```

---

## Diagnostic questions

* Are rerankers worth the extra spend? → check ΔS reduction vs token increase.
* Is hybrid retrieval doubling retrieval tokens with little gain?
* Does the large model add accuracy, or is a small model + WFGY equal at lower cost?
* Is citation length inflated (long snippets)? → enforce snippet contract.

---

## Escalation and fixes

* **High cost per correct** → switch to caching, smaller model with WFGY overlay.
* **Variance >15%** → clamp paraphrases, normalize prompt headers.
* **Budget overrun** → auto-throttle evals, alert with [alerting\_and\_probes.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Eval_Observability/alerting_and_probes.md).

---

## Minimal run

1. Select 20 mixed-length questions.
2. Run baseline and candidate arms.
3. Compute cost per correct.
4. Ship only if candidate ≤ 1.3× baseline and stable across seeds.
