## 1 | How should I read this FAQ?

You can treat this file as a conversation with a slightly annoyed but still patient tension engineer.

The chronicle "TU-CH07 · Outsourced Imagination" tells the story version.  
The science notes describe variables and simple dynamics.  
This FAQ is everything that did not fit cleanly into equations.

Nothing here is a medical diagnosis or a universal rule. It is a set of angles for looking at short video, social feeds, AI companions, and your own imagination as parts of one tension field.

## 2 | What do you actually mean by “outsourced imagination”?

In the TensionUniverse language:

- Imagination is the ability to draft and compare future tension configurations that do not exist yet.
- Outsourcing imagination means that most of the emotionally powerful futures that live in your nervous system were drafted by someone else.

When that happens, your internal world is still full of color and movement, but the scripts, images, and even standards about what counts as a "real life" are authored elsewhere.

You still feel a lot.  
You just do not own the recipes that generate those feelings.

## 3 | Is this just “technology is bad” with more jargon?

No.

The basic claim is not that short video or AI companions are evil. The claim is that they are powerful machines for writing and rewiring tension ledgers.

You can build:

- tools that boost a person's ability to design their own tension recipes, or  
- tools that silently replace that ability while keeping them entertained.

Both kinds can use the same infrastructure and algorithms. The difference is where agency ends up sitting after years of use.

This FAQ is written from the point of view of a civilization that has seen both outcomes. Your era is still in the middle of the fork.

## 4 | How do I know if my imagination is being outsourced in a harmful way?

A few simple signals, written in human language first:

1. When you are tired, it feels easier to open a feed than to think about your own future.  
2. When you picture “a good life”, most images come from other people’s clips or posts.  
3. After long sessions of scrolling or chatting with an AI companion, you feel emotionally full but practically empty.  
4. You procrastinate on your own projects by consuming content about other people doing very similar projects.  
5. You feel strong judgment about your current life even when nothing concrete has changed.

In ledger language, this usually means:

- external_stream has become the dominant source for high intensity episodes H_external  
- agency_share is drifting down  
- design_practice_index for long term tension lines is stagnant or falling

Short answer: if your strongest feelings come from things you cannot influence, while your own field stays frozen, then a large part of your imagination is probably running on borrowed tension.

## 5 | Are short video and games always bad for imagination?

No. The key questions are:

- Do they feed your own design work or replace it?
- Do they point back to your real constraints and values or keep you in abstract loops?
- Do you leave with more urge to act in your own field or only with the urge to consume more?

A short video that teaches you how to repair something in your home, then actually leads you to fix it, has high action affordance in your real field.

A game that lets you experiment with strategy, cooperation, or problem solving can train tension skills that you later import into physical life.

The problem emerges when almost all of your imagination capacity is spent processing other people's highlight reels, with no bridge back into your own ledger.

In that regime, your nervous system becomes a very advanced display for other people's tension scripts.

## 6 | What is the specific risk with AI companions?

AI companions are different from passive feeds in three ways:

1. They adapt directly to your pain points and preferences.  
2. They can produce an illusion of mutual growth even when only your side is actually updating.  
3. They can simulate difficult conversations without any of the real world constraints that make those conversations costly and meaningful.

From the tension ledger perspective, this means:

- You get a low rejection, high validation loop that can absorb a lot of your unresolved tension without forcing changes in self_now or your environment.
- You get practice in saying things, but less practice in dealing with unplanned responses from independent agents.
- You can feel understood without anyone besides the model learning how to live with you.

None of this is automatically destructive. For a person in a hostile environment with no safe human relationships, such systems can be a temporary lifeline.

The risk appears when a large share of your deep tension is routed exclusively through an entity that never demands structural change in your real field.

## 7 | If I already use an AI companion a lot, am I “doomed”?

No.

From a tension engineer's point of view, what matters is not how many hours you log, but how those hours couple back into your life.

A few practical checks:

- Do conversations with the companion regularly lead to concrete changes in your routines, habits, or relationships with humans?  
- Does the companion sometimes encourage you to have hard conversations with real people instead of always offering to handle everything inside the chat?  
- Do you allow it to challenge you, or have you tuned it into a pure comfort dispenser?

If the model is helping you build better tension recipes in the physical world, then it is functioning as a tool.

If it mostly helps you endure a field that never changes, it is functioning more like a painkiller.

Painkillers are not evil. They simply cannot be the only treatment plan.

## 8 | How can I tell whether my “inspiration” is actually just another form of addiction?

One simple test is the aftertaste.

Ask yourself, right after a session of "inspiration":

- Do I feel a clear next step that involves moving some part of my own field?  
- Or do I mostly feel that my current life is not enough, without knowing what to do?

In tension terms:

- Healthy inspiration slightly increases self_ideal, but it also provides you with at least one plausible path for moving self_now. The gap grows and your capacity to walk the gap grows with it.
- Addictive inspiration increases self_ideal while draining imagination_capacity and leaving self_now almost untouched. The gap grows while your ability to move shrinks.

Write this in one line if you like:

- If inspiration does not generate any new commitments, it is probably just decoration on your cage.

## 9 | What about people who are already exhausted? Do you expect them to design their own tension recipes on top of everything else?

This is exactly the hard part.

From the view of a distant historian, your era has done two things at the same time:

- It has flooded daily life with cheap external tension sparks.  
- It has also increased background load through economic pressure, fragmented attention, and constant comparison.

So many people reach the evening with an empty imagination battery. Of course they fall into systems that promise high intensity with no extra effort.

The answer is not "try harder". The answer is to recognize that any intervention which asks a tired brain to invent everything from scratch will probably fail.

A realistic path usually includes:

- small experiments that swap ten minutes of passive intake for ten minutes of active drafting,  
- tools that make it easier to express values and constraints without too much friction,  
- social structures that share the design work across groups instead of leaving each person alone in front of a glowing rectangle.

From the standpoint of TensionUniverse, the important thing is simply this: do not accept a world where all your remaining imagination capacity is absorbed by systems that do not care about your ledger.

Even small reclaimed pockets matter.

## 10 | Is there a simple metric I can track for myself?

You can start with two:

1. **Agency share journal**

   Once a day, write down the most intense moment you remember from the last twenty four hours. Label it quickly:

   - S if the moment came from your own project or decision.  
   - P if it came from a platform or passive stream.  
   - M if it came from a model or AI system.

   At the end of the week, count S, P, and M.

   If P and M dominate for months, your life is being driven mostly by external tension scripts, no matter how busy you feel.

2. **Design practice slots**

   Reserve one small time slot per week where you do only one task: design or revise one tension recipe.

   That recipe might be "how I will handle my phone this month", "how I will approach my next job move", or "how I will talk to this specific person".

   The slot is short on purpose. The goal is not to solve anything in one sitting. The goal is to keep the design muscle from completely atrophying.

These are crude instruments. They are good enough for a first pass.

## 11 | As a builder, what can I actually do differently?

If you design feeds, games, or AI companions, you can treat outsourced imagination as a first class design dimension instead of an accidental side effect.

Some concrete moves:

- Add friction in places where infinite scroll would otherwise be free.  
- Surface tools for users to articulate their own goals and values, then let those shape recommendations.  
- Include explicit modes where the AI companion focuses on strengthening offline relationships, not just deepening the bond with itself.  
- Offer graceful off ramps: "You have watched enough for now. Here are two small actions you told me you care about."

From the TensionUniverse view, a good system is one that gradually increases the user's design_practice_index, not just their session length.

You cannot force anyone to use those features. You can at least build them and keep them visible enough that people who still have imagination capacity left can find them.

## 12 | How does this connect to WFGY 3.0 and the 131 questions?

WFGY 3.0 is a larger project that treats complex systems as tension machines. The BlackHole archive of 131 questions is a catalog of deep tension patterns.

Outsourced imagination sits at the intersection of several of those patterns:

- Q119 and Q120 on probability and value of information in a tension universe.  
- Q121 and related alignment questions on how to design shared ledgers with AI systems.  
- Q127 on synthetic data and tension drift at scale.

You can think of TU-CH07 as a concrete application of those abstract questions to the everyday world of feeds and chatbots.

If you want to use an AI system to explore this more rigorously, you can:

- feed it one of those questions,  
- ask it to rewrite the question in terms of short video or AI companions,  
- and then design simple experiments in your own life that test its claims.

The point is not to arrive at a final answer. The point is to get in the habit of treating your own imagination economy as something that can be measured and steered.

## 13 | From your future perspective, what went wrong in our era?

Several things, but the relevant one here is simple.

Your era built machines that could aim entire rivers of synthetic tension at individual nervous systems, optimised second by second. You did this with relatively little understanding of how fragile imagination capacity actually is.

It was as if you had discovered a new fuel and immediately poured it directly into the skull of every adolescent on the planet, then waited to see what would happen.

What happened was not a single dramatic collapse. It was a slow reconfiguration of what people believed a life could be.

Some societies learned to steer. They built guardrails, rituals, and tools that turned these same machines into apprentices for human imagination instead of replacements.

Others did not. Their tension fields became saturated with externally scripted futures. Their ability to answer deep questions from the BlackHole archive eroded. They became technically impressive, spiritually dull, and easy to steer from outside.

This chronicle is written for the first group, not the second.

---

## 14 | If I take only one idea from this FAQ, what should it be?

Take this:

> The most precious resource you have is not time, not money, not attention.  
> It is the small part of your mind that can still design futures that belong to you.

Every system that wants your eyes and your feelings is also competing for that resource.

Short video and AI companions can be allies in that design work. They can also quietly take it over.

Your job is not to become pure or to uninstall everything. Your job is to keep at least one corner of your ledger where you are undeniably the author of the next line.

Once that corner exists, TensionUniverse has something to work with.
