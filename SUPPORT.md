# 🛠 Why support this project?

Developing and maintaining WFGY involves:

- Continuous refinement of the core reasoning architecture  
- Expanding documentation and integration references  
- Running structured experiments and stress tests  
- Iterating based on real-world feedback  
- Keeping the framework open and MIT-licensed  

This is long-term engineering work.

A contribution is not a feature purchase.  
It is support for sustained independent development.

# 📩 After you donate

If you would like:

- Confirmation of receipt  
- To be acknowledged as a supporter  
- To share feedback or suggest focus areas  

Please email:

📧 **donate@onestardao.com**

You may include:

- Transaction hash

# 🤝 Thank you

Open technical systems survive because people find them useful enough to keep them alive.

Whether you donate, share, test, or provide feedback, your involvement helps ensure WFGY remains independent and evolving.

Thank you for supporting open structural research.
