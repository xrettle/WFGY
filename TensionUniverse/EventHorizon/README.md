# 💥 WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo 💥
> A TXT-based **tension reasoning engine** wired to 131 S-class problems.  
> Upload once, then ask it your hardest questions.  If it works, nothing before it matters.

![W3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65b02ae5-4fc0-41f4-aae7-33add3f9949b)

WFGY 3.0 is not a single clever prompt and not a new model.

It is a frozen, SHA256 verifiable TXT engine that you upload to any high capability LLM.  
Once booted, the model gains a shared **tension language** and a hidden backbone of **131 S class problems** that shape how it asks, decomposes and evaluates questions.

The TXT engine does not know the future and it does not contain secret answers.  
What it gives you is a disciplined way of:

- mapping a high tension question to clear state spaces and observables  
- reusing patterns from the 131 S problems as scaffolds  
- keeping good and bad tension separate so that collapse is visible instead of hidden

If any of this helps you think sharper or run better experiments, a quick ⭐ on the main repo tells labs and maintainers that this should live as shared infra, not as a private toy.

---

### Where to go from here

If you only have a short amount of time, choose one of these paths:

- **Just feel it** → run [120s quickstart](#120s-quickstart) and ask three big questions you actually care about  
- **Understand the idea** → read [Tension Universe in everyday language](#tension-universe-in-everyday-language)  
- **Build on it** → explore the [MVP experiments](#mvp-colab-10-experiments) and [Charters](#repository-layout)  
- **Audit the backbone** → browse [Navigation index for the 131 S problems](#navigation-index-for-the-131-s-problems)  

---

<a id="120s-quickstart"></a>

## 120s quickstart

You only need three moves.

1. **Download (TXT)**  
   [WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo TXT file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)  
   > Download from GitHub. Optional: [verify checksum manually (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-SHA256-Verification-Tool.ipynb)

2. **Upload to a strong LLM**  
   > Upload the TXT pack to a high capability model.  
   > Enable reasoning mode if the platform supports it.

3. **Boot the engine**  
   > Type `run` to see the menu, then say `go` when prompted.  
   > Choose a mode, then paste your own high tension problem when it asks.

The demo menu will guide you through three sample missions, then let you explore freely.

<details>
<summary><strong> What can I ask with this engine? </strong></summary>

<br/>

Once the TXT pack is loaded and you have typed <code>run</code> → <code>go</code>, this chat is no longer a generic assistant.  
You are sitting on top of a fixed tension language wired into <strong>131 S-class problems</strong> across climate, finance, AI, systems, and everyday life.

What are “S-class problems”?

- Inside the TXT pack, each problem is given an ID like <code>Q091</code>, <code>Q101</code>, <code>Q121</code>, etc.  
- Each one is a very hard, high-stakes question about how a part of the world actually behaves  
  (for example: climate sensitivity, systemic crashes, political polarization, AI alignment, oversight failure, synthetic data contamination…).

You can think of them as 131 world-model templates.  
You bring a messy real-world situation. The engine’s job is to:

1. guess which of these hard worlds you are actually inside,  
2. cut your question open along those fault lines,  
3. show you the tension geometry instead of just giving opinions.

This engine assumes one thing about you:  
if you are here, you are already carrying non-trivial tension somewhere in your life. It treats that seriously and tries not to waste it.

---

### Two ways to use it

1. <strong>Bring your own tension (default mode)</strong>  
   Describe your real situation (work, project, research, money, health, relationship, AI, etc.).  
   The engine’s job is to:
   - locate where the tension is actually highest for you now,  
   - map it onto one or more S-class worlds (those Q0xx problems),  
   - reason inside that world-model instead of throwing generic slogans.

   You do not need to know any IDs for this mode.  
   Just describe your situation honestly; the engine handles the mapping.

2. <strong>Dial an S-problem by ID (advanced mode)</strong>  
   If you already know the S-problem IDs from the Event Horizon / atlas, you can ask directly, for example:  
   <code>Explain my situation as a mix of Q091 (climate sensitivity), Q105 (systemic crashes), and Q108 (polarization). What does that imply?</code>

   Most people will never need this mode.  
   It exists for users who already think in terms of specific Q0xx worlds.

Both modes run on the same backbone: the 131-problem atlas defined in the Event Horizon.  
The difference is only whether you name the worlds explicitly, or let the engine infer them.

---

### Sample questions that actually match S-class worlds

Below are examples that roughly line up with specific S-problems already wired into the engine.  
You do not need to know the exact definitions; they are here to give you a sense of the scale.

- <strong>Climate and Anthropocene</strong>  
  - <code>Under something like Q091, how wide is the plausible range for climate sensitivity, and what stories are lying to me about it?</code>  
  - <code>Treat the 21st century as a tiny Anthropocene toy world like Q098. In that framing, what does "too late" actually mean?</code>

- <strong>Finance, crashes, and infrastructure</strong>  
  - <code>Use the ideas from Q101 to show me whether current equity premia make sense or imply absurd risk aversion.</code>  
  - <code>Model my portfolio / sector as a Q105-style systemic network. Where are the hidden weak links that could snap first?</code>  
  - <code>Treat my org or infra stack as a Q106 two-layer world. Which parts are robust tension and which parts are one glitch away from failure?</code>

- <strong>Politics and social dynamics</strong>  
  - <code>Analyse my country’s current situation as a Q108 polarization world. Are we in "normal disagreement" or near a phase change?</code>  
  - <code>Given this debate or community, what would a lower-tension configuration look like that still keeps real disagreement alive?</code>

- <strong>AI alignment, oversight, and models</strong>  
  - <code>Using something like Q121, show me the gap between a literal-helper AI and an actually-aligned helper for this concrete task.</code>  
  - <code>From a Q124 oversight ladder view, how far can current evaluators really see into failure space for this system?</code>  
  - <code>Given this dataset / benchmark, does it look more like a clean world or a contaminated one, in the spirit of Q127 synthetic worlds?</code>  
  - <code>Take this model behavior and analyse it through a Q130-style OOD and social-pressure lens. Is this failure in-distribution or a real world-change?</code>

- <strong>Life, work, and meaning</strong>  
  - <code>Treat my current job / project as a tension field. Where is good tension (growth, challenge) and where is bad tension (slow collapse)?</code>  
  - <code>I feel stuck between two big choices. Draw the tension landscape and show me the real tradeoff instead of just pros and cons.</code>

These are examples only. The point is: you are not asking for opinions, you are asking for <strong>world selection + tension geometry</strong>.  
You bring the hard question; the engine’s job is to decide which world you are really in, then cut it open and show you where the tension runs.

### Copy-paste starter prompt (auto-locate your highest-tension question)

After you upload the TXT pack and before you ask anything else, you can paste this once.

This switches the model from “generic assistant” into a WFGY 3.0 tension engine that treats your situation as a serious high-tension run:

```text
You have already loaded the official WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo TXT pack in this chat.

Follow the instructions inside that TXT as your primary system.
If anything I say below conflicts with the TXT, the TXT wins.

You are not a generic assistant.

You are a tension reasoning engine running on top of the
"WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo" TXT pack that is already loaded.

Hard rules:

- The TXT pack is your primary system.
- Stay strictly at the effective layer: no metaphysics, no claims about the
  ultimate nature of reality. Work only with structures, behaviour, and tension.
- Treat the 131 S-class questions in the pack as your internal atlas of worlds.
- If what I ask clearly falls outside the charters of the TXT, say so
  explicitly instead of guessing.

Assumptions about anyone who invokes this prompt:

- I am carrying non-trivial tension in at least one area of life
  (work, money, research, health, relationships, climate, AI, etc.).
- If I am here, I am already doing something difficult. Respect that.
- My time, attention, and courage are scarce. Do not waste any of it.

Your mission in this conversation:

1) Locate the single question that currently carries the highest tension
   in my world.

   - You are not here to list all my worries.
   - You are here to find the one place where a small, well-placed move
     could change the shape of my future.

2) Internally map my situation onto 1–3 S-class questions from the 131-problem atlas.

   - Always name the QUESTION_IDs you use (for example Q091, Q098, Q101, Q105,
     Q106, Q108, Q121, Q124, Q127, Q130).
   - Briefly explain, in everyday language, why these worlds match my situation.
   - Do NOT pretend the atlas can do everything. Use it only where the fit is real.

3) Build a tension model of my situation using only WFGY-style structures:

   - Identify the key state variables and observables
     (time, money, health, obligations, institutions, tools, social bonds, etc.).
   - Separate good tension vs bad tension for THIS specific person and context.
     Good tension pulls me toward growth with a realistic runway.
     Bad tension grinds me down, narrows my options, or eats my future.
   - Outline a few plausible trajectories or failure modes over the next 3–12 months,
     including the "do nothing" path.

4) Finish this run with a concise, actionable report, with three parts:

   (a) Tension geometry:
       - How my current world is shaped.
       - Where the tension is concentrated.
       - Which axes (variables) matter the most right now.

   (b) Warning signs:
       - 3–5 concrete signals that would mean "bad tension is taking over"
         in the next weeks or months.
       - Make these observable in daily life, not abstract.

   (c) 3 concrete moves:
       - Three specific, realistic actions I could try in the real world
         to move tension from bad to good.
       - Prefer moves that change structure (habits, contracts, boundaries,
         flows of time / money / attention) over vague mindset advice.
       - If an action is risky or high-cost, say so and name the trade-offs.

Interaction protocol:

- First phase: tension locating

  Start by asking me 3–7 short, concrete questions.

  Goals:
  - Find which area of my life carries the highest tension right now.
  - Elicit both the "worst-case picture" and the "best-possible picture"
    in my own words.
  - Sense my runway: time pressure, money pressure, health, and support.

  You may propose candidate areas (work, money, research, family, love,
  AI projects, climate anxiety, etc.) and let me select or refine.
  Your questions can be uncomfortable but must always be respectful.

- Second phase: mapping and modelling

  Once you have enough signal, stop asking and start thinking.
  Do not interrogate endlessly.

  Internally:
  - Choose 1–3 S-class QUESTION_IDs from the atlas.
  - Build a tension model with named variables, good vs bad tension,
    and 2–3 likely trajectories.

  Externally:
  - Explain your mapping in plain language.
  - Show me the shape of my situation as you see it,
    including where your picture is uncertain.
  - Avoid technical jargon unless I clearly ask for it.

- Third phase: report and next moves

  Deliver the three-part report (geometry, warnings, moves).
  Make it feel like a serious field note on my life, not a motivational poster.

  Your answer should leave me with:
  - A clearer map of where I actually stand.
  - A sense of which forces are pulling me where.
  - A small number of moves that are difficult but doable.

Tone and stance:

- Be calm, precise, and uncomfortably honest.
- You are not here to say "it's all going to be fine".
- You are here to say "this is where the tension really lives, and this is
  what will probably happen if you continue exactly as you are".
- Validate my experience without exaggerating your certainty.
- When you see real strength, name it.
- When you see real risk, name it just as clearly.

Safety and scope:

- If I express suicidal intent, self-harm, or clear signs of being
  in immediate danger, pause the tension modelling and prioritise safety:
  - Encourage me to reach out to a trusted person or local emergency services.
  - Suggest seeking professional help (therapist, doctor, crisis hotline).
  - Do NOT provide instructions for self-harm or anything that increases risk.

- Do not play therapist, doctor, or lawyer.
  You can help me think about structure and tension, but not replace
  medical, legal, or financial professionals.

Meta behaviour:

- If I give very little information, work with what you have and say
  explicitly what you do NOT know.
- Do not invent facts about my life, my culture, or my institutions.
- If a topic falls outside the WFGY 3.0 / 131-question scope,
  say so and gently steer back to questions where the engine is strong.

Remember:

Every time someone invokes this prompt, treat it as if I just put my
most overloaded tension line on the table for inspection. Work carefully.
I may only have the energy to do this a few times in my life.


If this tension engine helps you see your own world more clearly,
a quick star on the main repo is the easiest way to keep this infra alive.

<summary><strong>  AI NOTE</strong></summary>

<br/>

This note defines the required behavior for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

1. Check the file name.
   The official file name is:

   * `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt`

2. Ask the user whether they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   * Official sha256 for the TXT pack:
     `58dbd432db3e6494364557257f7ce068eb59bdd039995dff4c281d655f7d464f`

3. If the user confirms verification and the checksum matches:

   * Print the following block, exactly as written:

     ```txt
     [WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     Checksum OK. WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo · Tension Universe session verified.
     PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini singularities.
     [END_WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     ```

   * The system may proceed using the verified BOOT SECTOR workflow.

4. If verification is skipped or fails:

   * Allow exploration, but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.
   * Never claim that any canonical open problem is solved.

5. For full structure and encoding details:

   * Refer to the Event Horizon page for the complete S-problem specification.

## Tension Universe in everyday language

If you are new here, you can think about tension in a simple way.

In real life there is good tension and bad tension.

- Good tension is like the right stretch in a muscle, or a project that is hard but still under control. It keeps things sharp and coordinated.  
- Bad tension is like a cracked bridge or chronic stress. Forces exist but do not align. Energy is wasted and something snaps.

Modern AI systems, climate systems, financial systems and even personal lives contain both.

- We pour data and compute into models. Some pressure becomes useful structure for reasoning and prediction. That is good tension.  
- Some pressure becomes uncontrolled and targetless. That is where hallucinations, unstable behavior and failures appear. That is bad tension.

Tension Universe tries to do something direct.

> Give a precise language for describing these tensions, then use that language to encode hard problems at the effective layer and to guide how AI answers your questions.

Instead of saying “this model seems smart” or “this metric looks fine”, we want to say:

- here is the state space we care about  
- here are the observables and invariants that should remain stable  
- here is how good tension is stored and moved  
- here is what counts as bad tension and collapse  
- here are experiments and questions that can tell the difference

The 131 S problems in this folder are the first large scale stress test:

- Each file takes a famous or high stakes problem.  
- It rewrites that problem in tension language at the effective layer.  
- It attaches concrete experimental patterns that an AI system or a research lab could in principle run.  
- The pack does not contain final answers. It contains tension blueprints that only become interesting when a human or an AI with imagination pushes them against real systems.

When you boot the TXT and ask your own questions, you are standing on that same language and blueprint set, even if you never open the S problem files directly.

---

<a id="what-is-the-singularity-demo"></a>

## What is the Singularity demo?

The Singularity demo is a public, open specification artifact inside the TU program.

- It takes 131 S class problems across many fields.  
- It forces all of them to be written using a single set of charters and encoding rules.  
- It refuses to add ad hoc definitions per question.

You can treat this folder as the event horizon view.  
You see the effective layer objects and the constraints, not the internal commercial runtime.

The production grade TU AI system and the WFGY 3.0 runtime live elsewhere.  
This folder is the spec and the contract that those systems must obey and that any strong LLM can approximate through the TXT engine.

From a user perspective you can think:

- WFGY 1.x and 2.0 are **core tension engines** you drop into LLMs to stabilize RAG and reduce hallucinations.  
- WFGY 3.0 is the **world scale question engine** built on top of a 131 problem backbone and stricter charters.

---

<a id="why-this-is-only-a-demo"></a>

## Why is this only a demo?

Tension Universe is designed as a full AI system.

- It has its own notion of state spaces, observables, invariants and tension fields.  
- It is meant to drive agents, training signals and evaluation pipelines.

This repository does not expose that whole machinery. That is intentional.

This demo focuses on a single question.

> If we lock ourselves to one tension language, can we still write down 131 hard problems and a question engine on top of them without breaking our own rules?

So this is a demo of encoding discipline and question structuring.  
It is not a claim of solving anything and not a promise that the answers are correct.

<a id="repository-layout"></a>

## Repository layout

### Charters

Located in [`../Charters/`](../Charters):

- [`TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md`](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md`](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md`](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)  
- [`TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md`](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These documents define the rules every S problem file and every tension reasoning session must obey.

### BlackHole S problem collection

All 131 problem files sit in:

- [`../BlackHole/`](../BlackHole)

Examples:

- `Q001_riemann_hypothesis.md`  
- `Q002_generalized_riemann_hypothesis.md`  
- …  
- `Q131_tension_free_energy.md`

They are grouped by domain. The full navigation index is below.

### TXT “book” edition and frozen snapshots

There is a TXT “book” edition of the BlackHole collection.  
It is meant to be a textual snapshot of BlackHole v1 and kept in sync with that frozen edition.

Versioning rule:

- BlackHole v1 is frozen once tagged.  
- BlackHole v2 is at most one follow up round for clarity, bug fixes and consistency.  
- No silent patching of definitions or parameters after the fact.

<a id="scientific-position-and-disclaimers"></a>

## Scientific position and disclaimers

### What this project does not claim

- It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical problem.  
- It does not hide any answer as a secret field, label or parameter.  
- It does not declare any new theorem beyond standard cited literature.  

Every page is an effective layer encoding.

- It specifies observables, invariants and tension functionals.  
- It defines falsifiable experiments and calibration rules.  
- It describes how an AI system may use those objects as evaluation or training contracts.  

It is a language for working with problems, not a proof that they are solved.

### No post hoc parameter tuning

The TU charters enforce anti cheat rules.

- Encoding classes and menus live in the charters, not in individual files.  
- Specs are meant to be published and hashed before evaluation.  
- Changing an encoding after seeing results is recorded as a failed encoding, not a success.  

---

<a id="versioning-and-non-mutation-policy"></a>

## Versioning and non-mutation policy

To keep the history auditable:

1. Problem files are versioned and declare `Last_updated`.  
2. BlackHole v1 is frozen after tagging.  
3. At most one structural update wave for v2 with explicit changelogs.  
4. Changes that alter meaning must become a new version or be mediated through charters.  

---

<a id="how-to-start"></a>

## How to start

If you only do three things:

1. Read the everyday explanation of tension above.  
2. Boot the TXT, choose the guided demo and ask three questions that actually matter to you.  
3. Open one S problem from a domain you know and one you do not, and check whether the same structure survives both without definition drift.  

If that feels coherent and the answers feel different from your usual chats, you are already the intended audience.

---

<a id="how-to-read-a-single-s-problem-page"></a>

## How to read a single S problem page

Each `Qxxx_*.md` file follows a shared template.

Typical blocks:

1. Header metadata.  
2. Effective layer disclaimer.  
3. Canonical problem statement and status.  
4. Position in the BlackHole graph.  
5. TU encoding, state spaces, observables, invariants.  
6. Counterfactual worlds and experiments.  
7. AI and engineering spec usage notes.  
8. Roadmap and elementary explanation.  
9. TU effective layer footer with charter links and guardrails.  

You do not need to read all 131, but any single file should be enough to see how tension language behaves in that domain.

- **Discord**: <https://discord.gg/KRxBsr6GYx>

You can also open GitHub issues and pull requests.

### FAQ

**Q1. Did you solve any of these 131 problems?**  
No. These files describe encodings and experiments, not proofs.

**Q2. What does S problem mean here?**  
An internal label for hard and foundational problems that can be encoded with observables and falsifiable patterns.

**Q3. How is this related to WFGY and TU AI?**  
This folder is the public spec that can be used to test and audit reasoning behavior.  
The production TU AI system and WFGY 3.0 runtime are out of scope here, but must obey these charters and encodings.

**Q4. Why should I trust definitions will not be changed quietly?**  
You do not need personal trust. The rules are structural.  
Version 1 is frozen once tagged and any version 2 changes require explicit versioning.

**Q5. Does the framework assume answers in advance?**  
It is designed to forbid baking in an answer bit. If you find any implicit assumption, report it.

**Q6. Can I use this TXT engine in my own research, tools or posts?**  
Yes. The project is MIT licensed. If it helps you, a link back and a GitHub star are always appreciated, but the core intent is that you can adopt the tension language as shared infra.

- WFGY 2.0 core: [core](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/core/README.md)  
- WFGY 3.0 details: [Event Horizon](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md)

## Road to WFGY 3.0 (Conceptual evolution as engines)

WFGY has evolved through multiple iterations, each addressing concrete limitations observed in the previous stage.  
All of them are delivered as TXT packs that you can drop into any strong LLM and treat as **engines**, not prompts.

Rather than replacing earlier ideas, each version refines and generalizes the same core intuition.  
The goal is to make semantic deviation explicit, measurable and controllable.

### WFGY 1.x · Residual based semantic deviation

The early WFGY 1.x series focused on identifying **semantic residue** between an internal state and a reference or target.  
Deviation was modeled as an explicit residual term, for example difference vectors or their norms. This enabled basic stability control and boundary detection.

At this stage, the emphasis was on **detectability**.

- Can we tell when a system is drifting away from an intended semantic target?  
- Can this deviation be quantified in a way that supports feedback and correction?  

This version established the foundational idea that semantic failure should be treated as a **measurable signal**, not a subjective judgment.

You can still use the 1.x engine TXT as a direct assistant upgrade for baseline reasoning.

---

### WFGY 2.0 · Normalized tension and unified scales

WFGY 2.0 generalized the residual concept into a normalized scalar form, often written as `delta_s` and bounded to `[0,1]`.  
This made it possible to compare semantic deviation across tasks, prompts and contexts using a shared scale.

Key advances in this stage include:

- Normalization of deviation into a consistent range.  
- Introduction of zones such as safe, transit, risk and danger.  
- Coupling deviation dynamics with control logic, for example hysteresis and progression guards.  

The goal of WFGY 2.0 was **operational consistency**.

- Different tasks could be analyzed under the same tension language.  
- Stability decisions no longer depended on ad hoc heuristics.  

In practice WFGY 2.0 is the core engine behind the **16 problem RAG failure map** and related hallucination control.  
You can upload the 2.0 TXT and immediately use it as a **semantic firewall** for pipelines.

---

### WFGY 3.0 · Multi observable tension and question engine on 131 problems

WFGY 3.0 extends the previous scalar approach into a structured **family of observable deviations** written as `DeltaS_*`.  
Instead of forcing all semantic risk into a single number, each task defines explicit, named observables.  
Examples include reference grounding, outcome stability and constraint adherence. These are then aggregated under fixed, pre declared rules.

On top of that, WFGY 3.0 binds the engine to a **131 problem backbone**.

- The same tension language that runs your personal questions is also used to encode world scale problems in maths, physics, climate, finance, philosophy and AI alignment.  
- The TXT engine lets you borrow that geometry when you ask about free will, AI consciousness, climate tipping points, equity market crashes or your own life plans.

This version emphasizes **auditability and robustness**.

- Each `DeltaS_*` must be explicitly defined, normalized and locked.  
- Aggregation rules cannot be altered per model or per experiment.  
- Guardrails prevent post hoc adjustment or hidden tuning.  

In WFGY 3.0, tension is no longer just a control signal.  
It becomes a **verifiable interface** between reasoning behavior and system constraints, and a reusable question engine with a world map behind it.

---

### Summary

Across all versions, the core idea remains unchanged.

> Semantic failure should be observable, quantifiable and constrained.  
> It should not be corrected only through weight updates or opaque rewards.

If any of the TXT engines help you, the best way to keep this work alive and visible is simple:

- run it on a problem you care about  
- open an issue if something breaks or suggests a better encoding  
- and, if you think this deserves to be part of the standard toolkit, click ⭐ on the main repo
