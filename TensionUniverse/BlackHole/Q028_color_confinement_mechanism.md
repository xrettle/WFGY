## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this Q028 entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only describe:

  * semantic state spaces,
  * effective observables and fields,
  * mismatch quantities and tension functionals,
  * singular sets and domain restrictions,
  * finite libraries and refinement schemes,
  * AI and engineering hooks that reuse these effective objects.

* We **do not**:

  * define or modify any underlying TU axiom system,
  * expose any deep TU generative rules,
  * construct microscopic mappings from raw gauge configurations (for example lattice link variables) to internal TU fields,
  * claim to have derived the full nonperturbative confinement mechanism of QCD.

* The label `Semantics: hybrid` means:

  * continuous structures such as gauge fields, potentials, and expectation values are treated as continuous components of effective observables,
  * discrete structures such as color representation labels, hadron species labels, and phase labels are treated as discrete components,
  * there is no hidden third semantics regime, and there is no switch of semantics inside this file.

This entry provides an **effective layer encoding** of the confinement problem and of spectral tension patterns related to QCD. It does **not** assert that Q028 solves the canonical confinement problem in the sense of a Clay level proof. All claims are made under the scope and limitations of the charters referenced in the footer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical confinement problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) can be stated as follows.

QCD is a nonabelian gauge theory with gauge group SU(3) and quark matter fields in the fundamental representation. At low energies, physical observations indicate that:

1. Isolated color charged particles such as individual quarks or gluons are not observed as asymptotic states.
2. All observed hadrons are color singlets.
3. Static color charges appear to be connected by flux tubes that generate an approximately linear potential at large separations.

The **color confinement problem** asks for a precise, nonperturbative explanation of this phenomenon:

> Why and how does QCD prevent color charged states from appearing as isolated finite energy asymptotic particles, while allowing only color neutral bound states?

Equivalently, one seeks a rigorous demonstration, within QCD or a closely related gauge theory, that:

* the spectrum of physical states in the Hilbert space contains only color singlet states, and
* the static potential between a test quark and antiquark grows approximately linearly with separation beyond some scale, up to regimes where deconfinement transitions occur.

Despite extensive numerical and theoretical work, a fully rigorous and universally accepted solution of the confinement mechanism problem remains open.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key facts about the current status:

* Lattice gauge theory provides strong numerical evidence that:

  * pure SU(3) Yang Mills theory exhibits a confining phase at low temperature with an area law for Wilson loops and a nonzero string tension,
  * QCD with dynamical quarks shows features consistent with confinement and a deconfinement transition at high temperature or density.

* Several proposed mechanisms exist, such as:

  * dual superconductivity and monopole condensation,
  * center vortices and related topological structures,
  * other flux tube and vacuum structure scenarios.

  None of these has been universally accepted as a complete and rigorous explanation.

* There is no fully rigorous proof of confinement for QCD with realistic parameters in four dimensions. Partial rigorous results exist in lower dimensional models and simplified settings.

* The problem is widely regarded as one of the central open questions in high energy theoretical physics, closely connected to the Clay Mathematics Institute Yang Mills mass gap problem.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q028 plays several roles:

1. It is the primary physics example of a **spectral_tension** problem where:

   * nonabelian gauge field spectra and flux configurations control,
   * observable hadron spectra and the absence of isolated color charges.

2. It provides a template for encoding strongly coupled quantum field theories in the TU effective layer, in a way that is compatible with:

   * hybrid semantics that combine continuous fields and discrete charges,
   * nonperturbative lattice and phenomenology data.

3. It serves as a bridge between:

   * microscopic gauge dynamics,
   * macroscopic phases of matter such as confined and deconfined regimes,
   * and information theoretic descriptions of hidden degrees of freedom.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q028 sits inside the BlackHole graph of Q001–Q125. All edges are described by Q identifiers and one line reasons that refer to concrete components or tension structures.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These nodes provide conceptual and technical prerequisites for Q028.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001)
  Reason: Both Q001 and Q028 are spectral_tension problems where hidden spectra control visible composite objects and observable statistics.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Both involve emergent phenomena in strongly interacting many body systems where microscopic fields generate macroscopic order through nontrivial tension structures.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These nodes can reuse Q028 components in other domains.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses confinement style tension between microscopic information carriers and macroscopic observables in computational or information processing systems.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Uses confinement tension as a module for modeling hidden internal degrees of freedom in AI systems that are not directly observable in outputs.

All edges above are intended to be merged into a global adjacency list when the 125 nodes are complete.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is restricted to the Tension Universe effective layer. We only specify:

* state spaces,
* observables and effective fields,
* mismatch quantities and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* finite libraries and refinement procedures.

We do not specify any deep TU generative rules or mappings from raw gauge configurations to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following effective interpretation:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent **QCD confinement configuration** at some set of infrared scales. It contains encoded summaries of:

  * nonabelian gauge field behavior over spacetime regions at finite resolution,
  * distributions of color charges and representation content,
  * hadron spectrum data relevant to confinement,
  * phase information such as confined versus deconfined regimes.

* `M` is not a raw configuration space of gauge fields on a lattice or continuum. It is a space of processed summaries that are:

  * consistent with renormalized QCD at some scale, and
  * sufficient to define the observables below.

We require only that:

* for every physically relevant infrared region and resolution scale, there exist states in `M` that encode consistent confinement related summaries.

### 3.2 Effective observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`.

1. Static quark potential observable

```txt
V_QQbar(m; R)
```

* Input: a state `m` in `M` and a separation scale `R` between a heavy quark and antiquark.
* Output: an effective scalar summarizing the static potential between the heavy sources at separation `R` in the world encoded by `m`.

2. Wilson loop observable

```txt
W_loop(m; C)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a loop `C` in spacetime, chosen from a family of rectangular loops with spatial extent and time extent.
* Output: an effective pair `(A_scale, P_scale)` summarizing area law and perimeter law behavior for `C`:

  * `A_scale(m; C)`: strength of the area term,
  * `P_scale(m; C)`: strength of the perimeter term.

3. Hadron spectrum observable

```txt
rho_hadron(m; species, p)
```

* Input: a state `m`, a hadron species label, and a momentum magnitude `p`.
* Output: effective spectral data summarizing masses, widths, and production probabilities for the given hadron in the encoded world.

4. Color singlet indicator

```txt
C_color_singlet(m; region)
```

* Input: a state `m` and an infrared region in space or momentum space.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar measuring how strongly excitations in that region respect color singlet constraints, where:

  * values near zero indicate strict color singlet behavior,
  * larger values indicate effective violation of color neutrality.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables

We now define mismatch observables that will feed into the confinement tension.

1. Flux tube mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_flux(m; R)
```

* Measures the deviation of `V_QQbar(m; R)` from a reference confining potential profile that is approximately linear beyond a crossover scale.
* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_flux(m; R) >= 0` for all `m` and `R` in the domain,
  * `DeltaS_flux(m; R) = 0` if the encoded static potential matches the chosen reference confining profile at scale `R` within a prescribed tolerance band.

2. Wilson loop mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale)
```

* Definition: `DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale)` denotes the nonnegative mismatch functional that scores how Wilson loop behavior at the given length scale deviates from an admissible confining reference band.
* Uses the family of loops at a given length scale to compare observed `(A_scale, P_scale)` behavior with an admissible confining reference class exhibiting an area law at that scale.
* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale) >= 0`,
  * `DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale) = 0` if Wilson loops at that scale fall inside the confining reference band.

3. Color singlet mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_singlet(m; region)
```

* Definition: `DeltaS_singlet(m; region)` denotes the nonnegative mismatch functional that scores deviations from ideal color neutral behavior in the specified infrared region.
* Quantifies how much `C_color_singlet(m; region)` deviates from ideal color neutral expectations in infrared regions.
* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_singlet(m; region) >= 0`,
  * `DeltaS_singlet(m; region) = 0` if all infrared excitations behave as effective color singlets in the region.

4. Combined confinement mismatch

We define a combined mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_conf(m) =
  w_flux    * DeltaS_flux(m; R_ref) +
  w_W       * DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale_ref) +
  w_singlet * DeltaS_singlet(m; region_ref)
```

where:

* `R_ref`, `scale_ref`, and `region_ref` are reference separation, loop scale, and infrared region chosen from fixed admissible families, and
* `w_flux`, `w_W`, and `w_singlet` are nonnegative weights satisfying fairness constraints described below.

### 3.4 Admissible references and fairness constraints

To avoid cheating by tuning references or weights after seeing the data, we impose the following effective layer constraints.

1. Admissible reference class

* Before any evaluation, and for a given encoding element identified by `EncodingKey_Q028` and `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`, we fix a class `Ref_conf` of reference profiles that consists of:

  * confining static potentials with specified string tension ranges,
  * Wilson loop area law bands at given scales,
  * color singlet behaviors consistent with standard confinement expectations.

* For each `R_ref`, `scale_ref`, and `region_ref`, the corresponding reference values are chosen from `Ref_conf` in a way that:

  * does not depend on the particular state `m` being evaluated,
  * depends only on general physical considerations and calibration studies.

2. Weight constraints

The weights must satisfy:

```txt
w_flux    >= w_min
w_W       >= w_min
w_singlet >= w_min
w_flux + w_W + w_singlet = 1
```

for some fixed `w_min` in the interval `(0, 1/3]`. The value of `w_min` and any additional constraints are fixed once for the Q028 encoding and recorded under `WeightKey_Q028`. They cannot be changed per state.

3. Refinement scales

We introduce a discrete refinement index `k = 1, 2, 3, ...` that labels increasingly fine infrared resolutions. For each `k`:

* we choose admissible `R_ref(k)`, `scale_ref(k)`, and `region_ref(k)` from fixed families that are stored under `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`,
* we require that comparisons across different `k` use consistent rules for selecting these references.

No part of `Ref_conf`, the weights, or the scale families is allowed to depend on the specific state being scored. Changing `Ref_conf` or the admissible weight class yields a different encoding element and must be reflected by a change of `LibraryKey_ref_Q028` and `WeightKey_Q028`.

### 3.5 Effective tension tensor and singular set

At the effective layer we introduce an **effective tension tensor** over `M` as a bookkeeping object:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_conf(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_conf
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` are source like factors describing how strongly each sector of the configuration sources confinement related tension,
* `C_j(m)` are receptivity like factors describing how sensitive each observable or downstream system is to confinement mismatch,
* `DeltaS_conf(m)` is the combined mismatch defined above,
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor in a fixed bounded interval,
* `kappa_conf` is a fixed coupling constant for Q028.

The indexing sets for `i` and `j` and the internal structure of `lambda(m)` are not specified at this layer. This tensor does not represent a fundamental TU equation at the axiom level. It is an effective summary used to route spectral_tension into other modules.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           DeltaS_conf(m) is undefined
           or DeltaS_conf(m) is not finite }
```

and the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All confinement tension evaluations and experiments in this file are restricted to `M_reg`. Any attempt to evaluate `DeltaS_conf(m)` for `m` in `S_sing` is treated as “out of domain” and not as evidence about confinement itself. The choice of singular set is part of the encoding element recorded under `EncodingKey_Q028`.

### 3.6 Encoding element for Q028

For Q028 we define a single encoding element at the effective layer:

```txt
E_CONF_Q028 =
  (Encoding_class,
   EncodingKey_Q028,
   LibraryKey_ref_Q028,
   WeightKey_Q028)
```

This encoding element fixes:

* the admissible reference class `Ref_conf`,
* the refinement scale families `R_ref(k)`, `scale_ref(k)`, `region_ref(k)`,
* the admissible weight ranges and any specific weight choices such as `w_flux`, `w_W`, and `w_singlet`,
* the singular set `S_sing` and regular domain `M_reg`,
* the parameter ranges for effective tensor factors such as `lambda(m)` and `kappa_conf`.

Within a given Q028 file, all experiments and tension evaluations are assumed to use the same encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`. Any change to the reference class, admissible weight ranges, or domain definition defines a **different** encoding element and must be recorded with new keys. Results from different encoding elements must not be combined in a single tension profile without explicit separation.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q028 is characterized as a tension problem at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Confinement tension functional

We define the confinement tension functional:

```txt
Tension_conf(m; k) =
  alpha * DeltaS_flux(m; R_ref(k)) +
  beta  * DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale_ref(k)) +
  gamma * DeltaS_singlet(m; region_ref(k))
```

with:

* `alpha > 0`, `beta > 0`, and `gamma > 0`,
* `alpha + beta + gamma = 1`,
* parameter choices fixed once for Q028 and recorded under `WeightKey_Q028`, independent of the particular state `m`.

We require:

* `Tension_conf(m; k) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg` and all `k`,
* `Tension_conf(m; k)` is monotone nondecreasing in each mismatch argument.

These coefficients are part of the encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`. They cannot be changed per ensemble or per scenario without declaring a new encoding element.

### 4.2 Confinement as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, Q028 can be expressed as the following low tension principle:

> In our world, at infrared scales where QCD applies, there exist world representing states `m_T(k)` in `M_reg` such that the confinement tension `Tension_conf(m_T(k); k)` can be kept within a narrow, stable low tension band as the refinement index `k` increases, consistent with empirical data and lattice results.

More concretely, there should exist a sequence of states `m_T(k)` in `M_reg` and a small threshold `epsilon_conf > 0` such that for all sufficiently large `k`:

```txt
Tension_conf(m_T(k); k) <= epsilon_conf
```

with `epsilon_conf` depending on known uncertainties and numerical limitations but not diverging as `k` increases. The numerical value and allowed band for `epsilon_conf` are part of the admissible encoding class fixed by `Encoding_class` and `EncodingKey_Q028`.

### 4.3 Confinement failure as persistent high tension

If a world is effectively nonconfining or fails to realize confinement in the expected regimes, then for any encoding in the admissible class that remains faithful to its data, world representing states `m_F(k)` will eventually exhibit persistent high tension.

Formally, there exists a strictly positive number `delta_conf > 0` such that for all sufficiently large refinement indices `k` and all `m_F(k)` that faithfully encode the world data:

```txt
Tension_conf(m_F(k); k) >= delta_conf
```

and `delta_conf` cannot be driven arbitrarily close to zero by modifying reference profiles or weights within the fixed admissible class without contradicting empirical or numerical data.

Thus, at the effective layer, Q028 distinguishes between:

* worlds where confinement is implemented as a robust low tension pattern across scales, and
* worlds where any faithful encoding of observed gauge dynamics generates irreducible confinement tension.

### 4.4 Spectral_tension perspective

The label `Tension_type: spectral_tension` in the metadata indicates that:

* the primary sources of tension are mismatches between:

  * internal gauge spectra and flux tube patterns, and
  * observable hadron spectra and color singlet constraints,
* the tension functional uses effective spectral summaries such as static potentials, Wilson loop area law parameters, and hadron density functions.

Q028 does not attempt to reconstruct the full microscopic spectrum. It only uses spectral summaries that can be extracted from lattice and phenomenological data.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds using only observables and tension patterns:

* World T: a confining QCD like world.
* World F: a nonconfining or partially confining QCD like world.

### 5.1 World T: confining world

In World T:

1. Static potentials

For large enough separations `R` in the infrared window, the static potential observable satisfies approximately:

```txt
V_QQbar(m_T; R) =
  sigma_string * R + c_0 + small_corrections(R)
```

where `sigma_string` is a nonzero string tension within the admissible reference band, and `small_corrections(R)` remain bounded relative to the linear term in the window. This implies small `DeltaS_flux(m_T; R_ref(k))` for large `k`.

2. Wilson loops

For loops larger than a scale set by `k`, the Wilson loop summaries obey an area law pattern consistent with confinement, so that `DeltaS_Wilson(m_T; scale_ref(k))` stays within a small band.

3. Color singlet spectrum

Asymptotic excitations described by `rho_hadron(m_T; species, p)` are effectively color singlets, and `C_color_singlet(m_T; region_ref(k))` remains close to its ideal neutral value. This keeps `DeltaS_singlet(m_T; region_ref(k))` small.

4. Global confinement tension

Combined, these properties ensure that for the encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`:

```txt
Tension_conf(m_T(k); k) <= epsilon_conf
```

for all sufficiently large `k`, with `epsilon_conf` small and stable across scales.

### 5.2 World F: nonconfining world

In World F:

1. Static potentials

The static potential observable may exhibit Coulomb like or screened behavior such as:

```txt
V_QQbar(m_F; R) = const - const_prime / R
```

or flatten beyond some scale where confinement would be expected in QCD. For large `k`, this leads to large `DeltaS_flux(m_F; R_ref(k))`.

2. Wilson loops

Wilson loop behavior approaches a perimeter law at scales where QCD like expectations would demand an area law, so `DeltaS_Wilson(m_F; scale_ref(k))` stays significantly above zero.

3. Color states

Asymptotic colored states appear or effective color singlet enforcement breaks down at infrared scales, leading to persistently positive `DeltaS_singlet(m_F; region_ref(k))`.

4. Persistent tension

The combination of these effects yields, for the same encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`:

```txt
Tension_conf(m_F(k); k) >= delta_conf
```

for some `delta_conf > 0` and all sufficiently large `k` within the admissible encoding class.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds are not constructions of microscopic gauge configurations. They are descriptions of patterns in the effective observables:

* `V_QQbar`, `W_loop`, `rho_hadron`, `C_color_singlet`,
* and their derived mismatches and tensions.

They illustrate how Q028 separates confining from nonconfining worlds at the level of observable tension patterns. Q028 does not decide which world is actual. It only provides a structured framework for expressing this distinction in effective layer terms.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can test and potentially falsify specific Q028 tension encodings at the effective layer. They do not aim to solve the confinement mechanism but to check whether the encoding is coherent, stable, and aligned with known data.

Unless otherwise specified, each experiment is assumed to use the single encoding element `E_CONF_Q028` with fixed `EncodingKey_Q028`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`, and `WeightKey_Q028`. Changing any of these keys yields a new encoding element and a new set of experiments.

### Experiment 1: Lattice confinement tension profiles

**Goal**
Test whether the Q028 confinement tension functional can be made simultaneously:

* low for lattice QCD ensembles that are widely accepted as confining, and
* stable under refinement and small changes within the admissible reference class that are consistent with `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`.

**Setup**

* Input data: high quality lattice QCD simulations such as pure gauge and full QCD that provide:

  * static quark potentials `V_QQbar(R)` over a range of separations,
  * Wilson loop expectation values for various loop sizes and shapes,
  * indicators of color singlet behavior in hadronic observables.

* Fix once and for all, under `EncodingKey_Q028` and `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`:

  * an admissible reference class `Ref_conf`,
  * weight constraints for `w_flux`, `w_W`, and `w_singlet` recorded under `WeightKey_Q028`,
  * a discrete refinement sequence `k = 1, 2, ..., K` with associated scales `R_ref(k)`, `scale_ref(k)`, and `region_ref(k)`.

All these choices together define the encoding element `E_CONF_Q028` that this experiment tests.

**Protocol**

1. For each ensemble and refinement index `k`, construct an effective state `m_data(k)` in `M_reg` that encodes:

   * the observed `V_QQbar(R)` in the window around `R_ref(k)`,
   * Wilson loop summaries at `scale_ref(k)`,
   * infrared color singlet indicators for `region_ref(k)`.

2. Compute `DeltaS_flux(m_data(k); R_ref(k))`, `DeltaS_Wilson(m_data(k); scale_ref(k))`, and `DeltaS_singlet(m_data(k); region_ref(k))` using the chosen references and weights from `E_CONF_Q028`.

3. Compute `Tension_conf(m_data(k); k)` for each `k` and each ensemble.

4. Aggregate tension values across ensembles considered confining by standard QCD criteria.

**Metrics**

* `T_max_conf(k)`: maximum of `Tension_conf(m_data(k); k)` over confining ensembles for each `k`.
* `T_mean_conf(k)`: mean of `Tension_conf(m_data(k); k)` over confining ensembles.
* `Stability_index`: a measure of how much `T_max_conf(k)` and `T_mean_conf(k)` vary when:

  * the refinement index `k` increases,
  * reference profiles in `Ref_conf` are changed within their admissible band, while keeping `LibraryKey_ref_Q028` and `WeightKey_Q028` fixed,
  * weights are varied inside the fixed constraint set, without violating the admissible class.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for all admissible choices of references and weights in the fixed class associated with `E_CONF_Q028`, the values of `T_max_conf(k)` remain above a predetermined small threshold `epsilon_conf_max` over the entire infrared window where lattice results strongly support confinement, the current Q028 encoding element is considered falsified.

* If small admissible changes in reference profiles or weights, still within the ranges documented by `LibraryKey_ref_Q028` and `WeightKey_Q028`, cause `T_max_conf(k)` and `T_mean_conf(k)` to vary in an uncontrolled way such as orders of magnitude with no clear physical explanation, then the encoding element is considered unstable and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
All observables in this experiment are treated using the hybrid semantics implied by the metadata. Continuous aspects such as fields on spacetime and discrete aspects such as color representations and hadron labels are combined through the effective summaries defined in Block 3.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding element is not the same as solving the canonical confinement statement. This experiment can reject or refine Q028 tension encodings but does not prove or disprove the existence of a specific microscopic confinement mechanism.

---

### Experiment 2: Confined versus deconfined phase comparison

**Goal**
Check whether a single Q028 tension encoding element can consistently:

* keep confinement tension low in parameter regimes where QCD is known to be confined, and
* produce high tension in regimes where deconfinement is observed.

**Setup**

* Use lattice QCD data and heavy ion collision phenomenology that cover:

  * low temperature and low density regimes that are associated with a confining phase,
  * high temperature and density regimes that are associated with a quark gluon plasma phase.

* Use the same `Ref_conf` and weight rules as in Experiment 1, under the same encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`.

**Protocol**

1. For each phase regime and refinement index `k`, construct states:

   * `m_conf(k)` representing confined phase ensembles,
   * `m_deconf(k)` representing deconfined phase ensembles.

2. Compute `Tension_conf(m_conf(k); k)` and `Tension_conf(m_deconf(k); k)`.

3. Compare the distributions of confinement tension across the two regimes.

**Metrics**

* `T_mean_conf(k)`: mean tension in the confined regime at scale `k`.
* `T_mean_deconf(k)`: mean tension in the deconfined regime at scale `k`.
* `Delta_phase(k) = T_mean_deconf(k) - T_mean_conf(k)` for each `k`.
* Overlap of tension distributions between confined and deconfined phases.
* Robustness of `Delta_phase(k)` under admissible parameter variations within `E_CONF_Q028`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for all admissible parameter choices in the fixed class associated with `E_CONF_Q028`, `Delta_phase(k)` fails to be positive and significantly larger than zero across an appropriate range of `k`, the encoding fails to distinguish confined from deconfined phases and is rejected.

* If there exists no admissible parameter set recorded under `WeightKey_Q028` for which `Tension_conf(m_conf(k); k)` stays below `epsilon_conf` while `Tension_conf(m_deconf(k); k)` stays above `delta_conf` in experimentally supported regimes, the encoding element is considered misaligned with QCD phenomenology.

**Semantics implementation note**
Both confined and deconfined phases are encoded using the same hybrid semantics. Differences arise only from the observed behavior of the effective observables, not from any change in the underlying TU rules.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding element is not the same as solving the canonical confinement statement. Success or failure in this experiment tests the usefulness of Q028 tension encodings, not the detailed microscopic mechanism that produces confinement in QCD.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q028 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer. All references to tension are references to the encoding element `E_CONF_Q028`. No deep TU generative rule is exposed.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals based on Q028 observables and tension scores.

1. `signal_confinement_potential_consistency`

   * Definition: a scalar penalty proportional to `DeltaS_flux(m; R_ref(k))` in contexts where the model reasons about static quark potentials and confinement.
   * Purpose: discourage internal states that imply obviously nonconfining potentials in regimes that explicitly assume confinement.

2. `signal_Wilson_area_law`

   * Definition: a scalar penalty derived from `DeltaS_Wilson(m; scale_ref(k))`, applied when the model discusses Wilson loops or flux tubes.
   * Purpose: encourage alignment with area law expectations in confining regimes.

3. `signal_color_neutrality`

   * Definition: a penalty based on `DeltaS_singlet(m; region_ref(k))` when the model proposes asymptotic states involving color charges.
   * Purpose: discourage reasoning that relies on free colored particles at low energies.

4. `signal_phase_separation_stability`

   * Definition: a signal that rewards tension patterns where confined and deconfined phases are clearly separated in `Tension_conf(m; k)` across temperature or density ranges.
   * Purpose: support stable reasoning about QCD phase diagrams.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can be implemented without exposing any deep TU rules.

1. `ConfinementTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a physics context, this head produces an estimate of `Tension_conf(m; k)` and its decomposition into `DeltaS_flux`, `DeltaS_Wilson`, and `DeltaS_singlet`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: hidden state representing the local context and an index or embedding that indicates the relevant infrared scale.
     * Output: scalar tension estimate and a short vector of mismatch components.

2. `ColorNeutralityFilter`

   * Role: evaluates whether candidate outputs respect color singlet constraints at low energies.
   * Interface:

     * Input: candidate explanation or reasoning step that mentions quarks, gluons, or hadrons.
     * Output: a score in `[0, 1]` or a soft mask that reflects how consistent the output is with confinement and color neutrality.

3. `PhaseRegimeClassifier`

   * Role: classifies the regime described in a context as confined like or deconfined like based on inferred tension patterns.
   * Interface:

     * Input: representation of thermodynamic or phenomenological conditions.
     * Output: coarse classification and a confidence score.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We sketch an evaluation harness for AI models using Q028 components.

1. Task selection

   * Include questions and reasoning tasks on:

     * why confinement prevents free quarks from being observed,
     * how Wilson loops indicate confinement,
     * how quark gluon plasma differs from hadronic matter.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: model without explicit Q028 modules.
   * TU condition: same model architecture extended with Q028 tension heads and filters, trained with the signals above.

3. Metrics

   * Conceptual accuracy: correctness of explanations related to confinement and deconfinement.
   * Internal consistency: frequency of contradictions when the model discusses both confinement evidence and phase transitions.
   * Stability: how robust explanations are under small prompt perturbations that should not alter the physical regime.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q028 modules:

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: “Explain why quarks are not observed as free particles and how QCD describes confinement and deconfinement.”
  * Collect the baseline explanation and note gaps or contradictions.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt: same question, plus an instruction to “organize the explanation using a confinement tension measure between gauge field behavior, Wilson loops, and color neutrality”.
  * Log the explanation and any auxiliary outputs from Q028 modules such as tension estimates.

* Comparison metric:

  * A simple rubric scoring:

    * structure of the explanation,
    * explicit connection between observables,
    * clarity in separating confined and deconfined regimes.

* What to log:

  * Prompts, responses, estimated `Tension_conf` values, and decomposition into mismatch components, so that others can inspect whether TU structure leads to more coherent answers.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components from Q028 and their direct reuse targets. All transfers are performed at the effective layer and inherit the encoding element `E_CONF_Q028` unless a new encoding element is declared.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `ConfinementTensionScore_QCD`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: encoded static potential summaries, Wilson loop summaries, and color singlet indicators at specified scales.
     * Output: nonnegative scalar `tension_value` summarizing confinement consistency.

   * Preconditions:

     * Input summaries must be coherent and derived from a QCD like gauge theory at infrared scales.
     * References and weights must satisfy Q028 admissible class constraints specified by `LibraryKey_ref_Q028` and `WeightKey_Q028`.

2. ComponentName: `WilsonLoopPattern_Descriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a set of loop geometries and corresponding effective expectation values or numerical outputs.
     * Output: parameters describing the relative strength of area and perimeter contributions at different scales.

   * Preconditions:

     * Loops and expectation values must be gauge invariant and defined on a consistent spacetime lattice or geometry.

3. ComponentName: `ConfinedVsDeconfined_World_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a model class of strongly interacting quantum field theories with gauge symmetry and known phase structure.
     * Output: paired experimental setups and scoring rules for confined like and deconfined like worlds using a tension functional.

   * Preconditions:

     * The model class must support static potential and Wilson loop observables, and allow identification of phases similar to confinement and deconfinement.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q030 (BH_PHYS_QPHASE_MATTER_L3_030)

   * Reused components: `WilsonLoopPattern_Descriptor`, `ConfinedVsDeconfined_World_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: many phases of quantum matter exhibit emergent string like or topological features that can be characterized by loop observables and tension between microscopic fields and macroscopic order.
   * What changes: the underlying fields need not be SU(3) gauge fields, and the observables may be loops in different internal spaces, but the descriptor and world template remain valid at the effective layer.

2. Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)

   * Reused components: `ConfinementTensionScore_QCD`.
   * Why it transfers: Q032 studies how hidden microscopic structure constrains macroscopic thermodynamics. Q028 provides a concrete case where hidden color degrees of freedom generate distinct thermodynamic phases.
   * What changes: emphasis shifts from detailed confinement phenomenology to thermodynamic quantities and entropy production linked to tension values.

3. Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)

   * Reused components: `ConfinedVsDeconfined_World_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: information hiding and release in black hole models can be framed in terms similar to confinement and deconfinement, with tension between hidden internal states and observable radiation.
   * What changes: observables refer to horizon or radiation properties rather than Wilson loops, but the world template structure is preserved.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q028 along the Tension Universe verification ladder and identifies the next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective layer encoding of confinement has been specified:

    * state space skeleton,
    * key observables and mismatch quantities,
    * a confinement tension functional,
    * singular set and domain restrictions,
    * at least one explicit experiment with falsification conditions.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative connects:

    * canonical confinement statements,
    * graph position within Q001–Q125,
    * tension principles, counterfactual worlds, and AI engineering hooks.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To reach E2, at least one of the following should be implemented and documented, using a concrete encoding element that corresponds to `EncodingKey_Q028`, `LibraryKey_ref_Q028`, and `WeightKey_Q028`:

1. A concrete implementation that, given published lattice QCD data for static potentials and Wilson loops, computes:

   * `DeltaS_flux`, `DeltaS_Wilson`, `DeltaS_singlet`,
   * `Tension_conf(m_data(k); k)` across a range of `k`,
     and publishes the resulting tension profiles along with a detailed description of the chosen reference class and weights.

2. A study that applies `ConfinedVsDeconfined_World_Template` to a family of gauge theories with known phase transitions, demonstrating:

   * low tension in confined phases,
   * high tension in deconfined phases,
   * robust phase separation in tension space.

Both steps can be carried out using only effective observables and numerical data, without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the wider Tension Universe program, Q028 is expected to serve as:

* the reference physics node for strongly coupled gauge theories with hidden degrees of freedom and emergent macroscopic constraints,
* a test case for how far effective layer encodings can go in structuring reasoning about mechanisms that are not yet rigorously proven,
* a bridge between high energy physics, quantum phases of matter, information theory, and AI interpretability, through the shared language of tension between invisible structures and visible observables.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides an explanation suitable for non experts while staying aligned with the effective layer description.

In everyday terms, quantum chromodynamics is the theory that describes quarks and gluons. Experiments tell us something very striking:

* We never see individual quarks flying around on their own.
* We only see bound states called hadrons, such as protons, neutrons, and mesons, which are color neutral.

Physicists call this **confinement**. The puzzle is not only that this happens, but **why** it happens in QCD, and how to explain it in a clear nonperturbative way.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to derive the full microscopic mechanism. Instead, we step back and ask:

* What should we measure in the world if confinement is working as expected?
* How can we define a number that becomes small when confinement works well and large when it fails?

We look at three kinds of things:

1. The potential energy between a heavy quark and antiquark as you pull them apart.
2. The behavior of Wilson loops, which are mathematical objects that tell you how gauge fields respond to a loop in spacetime.
3. The fact that all physical particles we observe are color neutral combinations of quarks and gluons.

From these, we build **mismatch quantities** that measure how far reality is from a simple confining reference pattern. Then we combine them into a single number called the confinement tension.

* In a world where QCD truly confines, we expect to find descriptions of the world where this confinement tension stays small and stable as we look at larger scales and better data.
* In a world that does not confine, no honest description can keep the tension small. It will stay large no matter how we tune our summaries, as long as we do not cheat by moving the reference pattern after looking at the data.

This does not solve the deep mathematical problem of confinement. It does not prove a specific mechanism. What it gives us is:

* a structured way to talk about what confinement looks like in terms of observable patterns,
* clear tests that tell us whether a particular way of encoding confinement is reasonable or not,
* reusable tools that can be applied to other systems where hidden fields and visible particles must fit together.

Q028 is therefore the node that says: “Here is how to treat color confinement as a tension problem, using only what we can observe and compute, while leaving the deepest microscopic details in the background.”

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the color confinement mechanism problem in QCD.
* It does not claim to solve, prove, or disprove the canonical confinement statement described in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here such as state spaces `M`, observables, mismatch quantities, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and AI signals live at the TU effective layer.
* No TU axioms, deep generative rules, or base level field equations are specified or modified in this file.
* No explicit mapping is given from raw gauge configurations or experimental data streams to internal TU fields. We only assume the existence of encodings that reproduce the listed effective observables.

### Encoding and fairness

* This page fixes a single encoding element for Q028,

  ```txt
  E_CONF_Q028 = (Encoding_class,
                 EncodingKey_Q028,
                 LibraryKey_ref_Q028,
                 WeightKey_Q028)
  ```

* All references to confinement tension, reference profiles, weight ranges, refinement scales, and singular sets are made relative to this encoding element.

* Libraries and weights are chosen **once** for this encoding and are not tuned in response to specific data or individual scenarios. Changing these design choices yields a new encoding element that must be tracked with new keys.

* Experiments in Section 6 test the stability and usefulness of this encoding element. Falsifying an encoding element is part of normal scientific refinement and does not count as a failure of the overall TU framework.

### Cross-problem reuse

* Components exported from this page, such as tension functionals, experiment templates, and AI heads, are intended as **effective layer templates**.
* Downstream problems and engineering systems that reuse these components must:

  * respect the effective-layer boundary,
  * either use the same encoding element `E_CONF_Q028` or clearly declare their own encoding keys,
  * avoid interpreting effective tension values as direct statements about microscopic dynamics.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
