### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

> ⚠️ Beta Landing Page – Launch date will be announced in Discussions.  
> The release timing isn’t final yet — please stay tuned.  
> In the meantime, the author is off earning some GitHub stars. 🪐✨  
> Thanks for your patience!

> Semantic logic meets nostalgic gaming. And yes, you’ll have to *blow the cartridge*.

Blow Blow Blow is our third TXT-based module — a retro-inspired AIGC gaming system  
built on **semantic reasoning**, **Tree Memory**, **Knowledge Boundary**, and more.  
It's not just an experiment. It's a **reboot of interactive logic** inside `.txt` form.

You’ll soon be able to play multiple handcrafted games:
- Classic dungeon crawlers powered by reasoning engines  
- Puzzle games where hallucinations are the enemy  
- Narrative RPGs that learn as you play (via semantic residue)

> 🕹️ You don’t install anything. Just run the `.txt`. Boom, you're in the game.

### 🤔 Why is it called “Blow Blow Blow”?

Because every real gamer from the golden era of NES and GameBoy knows:  
**You always had to blow the cartridge** three times before it worked.  
This module is a tribute to that ritual —  
except this time, the magic is semantic instead of static electricity.
