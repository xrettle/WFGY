A compact harness to verify **retrieval and reasoning under code-switching** and multilingual inputs. Use this to measure ΔS and λ across three variants of each question: source language, target language, and mixed script or code-switched.

---

## Acceptance targets

* ΔS(question, retrieved) ≤ 0.45 for each of the three variants
* Coverage of the target section ≥ 0.70
* λ remains convergent across three paraphrases and two seeds
* E\_resonance stays flat on long windows that mix scripts

---

## Gold set format

Create a small file you can run in any stack. CSV or JSONL both fine. Recommended CSV schema:

```
id,question_src,question_l2,question_mix,anchor_doc_id,anchor_offsets,answer_short,notes
ex001,"what is the dosage of abc?","藥品abc的劑量是多少？","abc dosage要怎麼算？",doc_042,"[120, 180]","10 mg BID","CJK mix"
```

Rules

* `question_src` is your primary language.
* `question_l2` is the same meaning in the second language.
* `question_mix` is a natural code-switch that users would actually type.
* `anchor_doc_id` and `anchor_offsets` point to the authoritative span.
* Keep 20 to 50 rows for a first pass.

## 60-second runner outline

You can paste this into any quick script. Replace the retrieval call with your own client.

```python
# minimal pseudo-runner for ΔS and λ probes
from collections import defaultdict

K_LIST = [5, 10, 20]
VARIANTS = ["question_src", "question_l2", "question_mix"]

def retrieve(q, k):
    # call your store, return list of {doc_id, offsets, text}
    return call_retriever(query=q, top_k=k)

def delta_s(a, b):
    # use your ΔS implementation. lower is better.
    return compute_delta_s(a, b)

def lambda_state(history):
    # classify →, ←, <>, × based on stability of attention or order
    return classify_lambda(history)

def run_row(row):
    out = []
    for v in VARIANTS:
        q = row[v]
        lambda_hist = []
        best = None
        for k in K_LIST:
            hits = retrieve(q, k)
            if not hits:
                lambda_hist.append("×")
                continue
            # pick your best hit by rerank or score
            best = hits[0]
            s_qr = delta_s(q, best["text"])
            s_ra = delta_s(best["text"], anchor_text(row["anchor_doc_id"], row["anchor_offsets"]))
            lambda_hist.append((k, s_qr, s_ra))
        out.append({
            "variant": v,
            "lambda": lambda_state(lambda_hist),
            "s_qr@5": lambda_hist[0][1] if lambda_hist and isinstance(lambda_hist[0], tuple) else 1.0,
            "s_qr@10": lambda_hist[1][1] if len(lambda_hist) > 1 and isinstance(lambda_hist[1], tuple) else 1.0,
            "s_qr@20": lambda_hist[2][1] if len(lambda_hist) > 2 and isinstance(lambda_hist[2], tuple) else 1.0,
        })
    return out
```

Output columns you want in a flat table

* `id`, `variant`, `λ_state`, `ΔS@5`, `ΔS@10`, `ΔS@20`, `pass`
* Mark pass when ΔS ≤ 0.45 and λ is convergent.

## Probe plan

1. **Lock analyzers**
   Use the same normalization at index and query. If you must change anything, run the whole gold set again. Only one variable at a time.

2. **Triplet run**
   For each row run `question_src`, `question_l2`, `question_mix` at k ∈ {5, 10, 20}. Log ΔS and λ per variant.

3. **Three-paraphrase run**
   For the worst failing variant, add three small paraphrases in the same language. If λ flips while citations stay valid, apply schema locks and BBAM.

4. **Anchor triangulation**
   Compare ΔS to the anchor span and to a decoy in the same document. If both similar, re-chunk and re-embed.

---

## Decision rules

* **Only the mixed variant fails**
  Suspect script mixing or analyzer split. Open [script\_mixing.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Language/script_mixing.md).
  Also verify you did not change casing or width in only one path.

* **L2 fails, source and mix pass**
  Likely tokenizer mismatch or missing segmenter. Open [tokenizer\_mismatch.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Language/tokenizer_mismatch.md).

* **zh-Hans vs zh-Hant do not co-retrieve**
  Add variant mapping and normalize digits and punctuation. Open [locale\_drift.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Language/locale_drift.md).

* **All three variants fail with high similarity**
  Embedding is not multilingual or metric is wrong. Open [embedding-vs-semantic.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/embedding-vs-semantic.md) and the Retrieval Playbook to rebuild.

* **Hybrid worse than single**
  Fix query parsing split and reranker weights. Open [patterns/pattern\_query\_parsing\_split.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/patterns/pattern_query_parsing_split.md) and [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md).

## Copy-paste prompt for the LLM judge step

```
You have TXTOS and the WFGY Problem Map loaded.

Context:
- gold id: {id}
- variant: {variant}
- retrieved snippet: "{snippet}"
- expected anchor: "{anchor_excerpt}"
- ΔS(question, retrieved) = {s_qr}
- ΔS(retrieved, anchor) = {s_ra}

Tasks:
1) Decide pass or fail for retrieval alignment. If fail, name the failing layer.
2) Return the exact WFGY page to fix it.
3) Give a minimal repair plan with 3 steps.
4) Output JSON only:
   {"pass": true|false, "fail_layer": "...", "open": [".../page1.md",".../page2.md"], "plan": ["step1","step2","step3"]}
```

## Minimal dataset checklist

* At least one trilingual example with names that have native and romanized forms
* At least one code-switch that uses Latin terms inside CJK or Indic sentences
* At least one RTL or diacritic heavy example
* Keep a small “sanity” row that always passes after a clean rebuild

---

## What good looks like

* Pass rate ≥ 90 percent on `question_src` and `question_l2`
* Mixed variant pass rate ≥ 80 percent after analyzer unification
* No λ flip in the three-paraphrase probe for the same variant
* ΔS median ≤ 0.40 on all variants after fixes
