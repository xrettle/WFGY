## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This document specifies state spaces, observables, effective fields, mismatch quantities, tension functionals, counterfactual worlds, and experiment templates.
* It does not specify any underlying TU axiom system, generative dynamics, or constructive rules for how TU fields arise from physical or computational substrates.
* It does not provide any explicit mapping from raw biological data to internal TU fields. It only assumes that such mappings exist within admissible encoding classes.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical neural coding problem stated in Section 1. It only proposes one way to encode that problem at the effective layer, in a form that is falsifiable and reusable.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited scientific literature. All scientific claims about brains and behavior are meant as summaries of existing work.
* Any tension quantities defined here are effective diagnostics. They are not claimed to be quantities that biological systems literally optimize.

All choices of encoding classes, tension scales, and fairness conditions are meant to be read together with the core TU charters listed in the footer. Those charters govern:

* which kinds of effective encodings are admissible,
* how thresholds and bands for tension are chosen,
* and how experiments must be pre registered and audited.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem of neural coding asks:

How does the brain encode information in patterns of neural activity across time and populations, such that these patterns support perception, action, learning, and cognition?

More concretely, the questions include:

* What variables are represented by neurons and neural populations, for example sensory features, motor commands, internal states.
* What code families are used, for example firing rates, precise spike timing, synchrony, population patterns, low dimensional manifolds.
* How reliable and efficient these codes are, given biological noise, metabolic cost, and anatomical constraints.
* How codes are transformed across stages of processing and across brain areas.

Despite many partial answers in specific systems, there is no consensus unified set of neural coding principles that explains coding across modalities, species, and scales.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Current knowledge includes:

* Detailed case studies where specific neurons or populations encode particular sensory features or motor variables.
* Formal theories such as efficient coding, redundancy reduction, sparse coding, and predictive coding, which explain aspects of sensory representations under certain conditions.
* Information theoretic analyses that quantify the amount of information carried by spikes or population activity about defined stimuli or tasks.
* Experimental evidence that neural codes can be flexible and context dependent, changing with attention, learning, or behavioral state.

Difficulties include:

* High dimensionality and noise in neural activity.
* Limited sampling of neurons relative to the full population.
* Complex, nonstationary relationships between activity, stimuli, and internal variables.
* Multiple candidate code families that can explain the same data within error bars.

As a result, the existence and nature of a small set of general coding principles remains an open problem in neuroscience.

In this document we do not attempt to solve that canonical problem. We only specify an effective layer encoding and tension framework that can be tested, compared, and falsified without exposing any deeper TU generative rules.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q083 plays several roles.

1. It is the primary node for questions where information is carried by biological activity patterns under strong resource and noise constraints, with `computational_tension` as the main tension type.
2. It provides a structured way to describe neural codes as effective fields and observables that can be compared across brain regions, tasks, and species.
3. It feeds downstream problems that depend on coding, such as memory storage (Q084), plasticity rules (Q085), and social cognition (Q090). It also provides biological templates for AI representation and interpretability questions (Q123).

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block places Q083 within the BlackHole graph as a node with upstream, downstream, parallel, and cross domain edges. Each edge has a single line reason tied to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide foundations and constraints that Q083 must respect.

* Q081 (`BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081`)
  Reason: Defines the broader space of conscious states that neural codes must at least be capable of supporting as effective representations.

* Q082 (`BH_NEURO_BINDING_L3_082`)
  Reason: Provides constraints on how distributed coded features must bind into unified percepts that any coding principle must allow.

* Q078 (`BH_BIO_DEVELOPMENTAL_L3_078`)
  Reason: Limits possible coding architectures by what biological development can reliably construct and maintain.

* Q088 (`BH_NEURO_DEV_PATTERN_L3_088`)
  Reason: Supplies effective constraints from cortical maps and developmental patterning on which population codes are biologically reachable.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q083 components or depend directly on its coding tension structures.

* Q084 (`BH_NEURO_MEMORY_STORE_L3_084`)
  Reason: Reuses the `NeuralCodeField` and `CodeEfficiencyFunctional` components to define what kinds of representations can be stably stored.

* Q085 (`BH_NEURO_PLASTICITY_RULES_L3_085`)
  Reason: Uses `CodeEfficiencyFunctional` as a target for plasticity, where synaptic changes seek to reduce coding tension.

* Q090 (`BH_NEURO_SOC_BRAIN_L3_090`)
  Reason: Builds high level social representations on top of lower level population codes described by `NeuralCodeField`.

* Q123 (`BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123`)
  Reason: Uses `CrossContextCodeGraph` and related components as blueprints for interpreting internal AI representations as codes.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component reuse at this stage.

* Q032 (`BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032`)
  Reason: Both Q032 and Q083 involve physical systems that carry information under thermodynamic and noise constraints, with `computational_tension` patterns constrained by energy and entropy.

* Q059 (`BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059`)
  Reason: Both formulate tradeoffs between information processing, energy cost, and robustness as `computational_tension` problems.

* Q121 (`BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121`)
  Reason: Internal AI goal codes and their stability can be analyzed using code tension ideas parallel to those in biological neural coding.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges link Q083 to non neuroscience nodes that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (`BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032`)
  Reason: Can reuse `CodeEfficiencyFunctional` as a template for mapping between coding efficiency and energetic cost in physical substrates.

* Q059 (`BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059`)
  Reason: Reuses the notion of `Tension_code` as a functional that balances accuracy, robustness, and cost in engineered information systems.

* Q101 (`BH_ECON_EQUITY_PREMIUM_L3_101`)
  Reason: Agent internal codes for risk and reward can conceptually reuse `NeuralCodeField` and `CrossContextCodeGraph` structures.

* Q125 (`BH_AI_MULTI_AGENT_DYN_L3_125`)
  Reason: Multi agent internal representations can reuse population code descriptors and cross context tension measures from Q083.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is strictly at the effective layer. It describes state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and singular sets. It does not describe any deep TU generative rules or mappings from raw data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with elements `m` that represent coherent neural coding configurations at the effective layer.

For each `m` in `M`, we assume:

* A finite set of neurons or neural populations `N(m)` is in focus.
* A finite time window `T(m)` is considered, with resolution fine enough to distinguish relevant temporal patterns.
* For each neuron or population in `N(m)` and each time bin in `T(m)`, there exists an effective activity descriptor.

We do not specify how these descriptors are computed from raw spike trains or continuous voltage traces. We only assume that such summarizing descriptors exist and can be treated as well defined quantities in the effective model.

### 3.2 Effective activity observables

We define activity observables that map each state `m` to summaries of neural activity.

1. Single unit activity

   ```txt
   A_single(m; n, t)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, neuron index `n` in `N(m)`, time bin `t` in `T(m)`.
   * Output: scalar that encodes effective activity at that neuron and time, for example spike count or normalized firing rate.

2. Population activity

   ```txt
   A_pop(m; P, t)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, subset `P` of `N(m)`, time bin `t`.
   * Output: vector or low dimensional descriptor summarizing collective activity of `P` at time `t`.

3. Context labels

   ```txt
   Cxt(m; k)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, context index `k`.
   * Output: descriptor specifying the stimulus condition, task variable, or internal state relevant for this configuration.

These observables are assumed to be well defined for all regular states in `M`. We do not prescribe their construction from data.

### 3.3 Code field descriptors

We define effective code field descriptors that attempt to capture structured coding motifs.

1. Rate code descriptor

   ```txt
   C_rate(m; n)
   ```

   * Summarizes the dependence of average activity of neuron `n` on context labels across `T(m)`.
   * For example, tuning curves or low order statistics of `A_single` over contexts and time.

2. Temporal code descriptor

   ```txt
   C_temp(m; n, window)
   ```

   * Captures temporal structure in the spike or activity pattern of neuron `n` within a time window.
   * For example, inter spike interval patterns or phase relationships relative to an oscillatory reference.

3. Population code descriptor

   ```txt
   C_pop(m; P)
   ```

   * Summarizes joint activity in a subset `P` of neurons, for example low dimensional manifolds, principal components, or pattern dictionaries.
   * It is treated as a structured object at the effective layer without specifying any particular algorithm.

These descriptors allow us to talk about code families such as rate codes, temporal codes, and population codes without committing to a particular implementation.

### 3.4 Information observables

We introduce coarse information theoretic observables at the effective layer.

1. Stimulus information

   ```txt
   I_stim(m)
   ```

   * Represents mutual information between defined stimulus variables and neural activity descriptors in the configuration `m`.
   * Treated as a scalar that can be estimated in principle from stimuli and `A_single` or `A_pop`.

2. Task information

   ```txt
   I_task(m)
   ```

   * Represents mutual information between task relevant variables, for example decisions or rewards, and neural activity descriptors in `m`.

3. Code cost

   ```txt
   C_cost(m)
   ```

   * Represents an effective resource cost associated with maintaining and using the neural code in `m`, for example metabolic expenditure or wiring cost.

We do not specify estimators, only the existence of such effective quantities.

### 3.5 Mismatch observables and combined code tension

We define mismatch observables that compare actual codes to reference families.

1. Structural mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_struct(m)
   ```

   * Nonnegative scalar that measures deviation of observed code descriptors `C_rate`, `C_temp`, `C_pop` from a chosen reference code family, for example sparse linear codes or smooth manifold codes.
   * `DeltaS_struct(m) = 0` if the descriptors lie exactly within the reference family under the encoding.

2. Noise robustness mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_noise(m)
   ```

   * Nonnegative scalar that measures how much performance or information degrades under noise injections relative to predicted robustness from the reference code family.

3. Resource mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_resource(m)
   ```

   * Nonnegative scalar that measures deviation of observed code cost `C_cost(m)` from a target cost range predicted by efficient coding or related principles.

We fix an admissible encoding class `E_code` that specifies:

* which reference code families are allowed,
* which parameter ranges are allowed when fitting these families,
* and which summaries the mismatch quantities above are allowed to depend on.

For any encoding within `E_code`, we define fixed positive weights:

```txt
w_struct   > 0
w_noise    > 0
w_resource > 0
w_struct + w_noise + w_resource = 1
```

These weights must be chosen before running any experiment that uses this encoding and remain fixed for that encoding across all states and tasks in that study.

The combined coding tension is then defined on regular states by:

```txt
Tension_code(m) =
    w_struct   * DeltaS_struct(m) +
    w_noise    * DeltaS_noise(m) +
    w_resource * DeltaS_resource(m)
```

for all `m` in the regular domain defined below.

The numerical values of `w_struct`, `w_noise`, `w_resource`, and of any thresholds or bands for `Tension_code` are chosen in accordance with the TU Tension Scale Charter. They are treated as part of the pre registered analysis plan, not as free tuning knobs after observing data.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restriction

Some states may be ill posed for coding analysis, for example if activity descriptors are missing or inconsistent so that mismatch quantities cannot be evaluated.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           DeltaS_struct(m)   is undefined
           or DeltaS_noise(m) is undefined
           or DeltaS_resource(m) is undefined }
```

We then define the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All code tension analysis at the effective layer is restricted to `M_reg`. Whenever a protocol would need `Tension_code(m)` for `m` in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain. It does not count as evidence for or against any coding principle. It only reveals limits of the chosen encoding and data pipeline.

### 3.7 Admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints

This section states how the encoding class `E_code` is constrained so that analyses are fair and auditable. These rules follow the TU Effective Layer Charter and the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.

1. Finite encoding library

   * `E_code` is a finite library of named encoding types, for example:

     ```txt
     E_code = {
       sparse_linear,
       low_dim_manifold,
       temporal_precision,
       population_dictionary
     }
     ```

   * Each encoding type has a separate metadata document that specifies:

     * which code families it represents,
     * what parameter ranges are allowed,
     * and which observables and descriptors it is allowed to use.

2. Pre selection and stability

   * For any given study, one encoding type in `E_code` is selected using only:

     * task class,
     * data modality,
     * and intended resolution.
   * This choice must be made before accessing held out test data and before looking at tension values.
   * Within that encoding type, parameters are chosen in a bounded region specified in the metadata. Small parameter changes are not allowed to produce unbounded swings in `Tension_code` for the same data and code family.

3. Fixed weights and reuse

   * For each encoding type, the triplet `(w_struct, w_noise, w_resource)` is fixed before any analysis that uses that type.
   * All conditions, datasets, and models compared under that encoding type must use the same weight triplet.
   * Post hoc adjustment of weights to minimize observed tension on particular datasets is not allowed.

4. Cross encoding comparisons

   * When several encoding types in `E_code` are compared, each type is first fixed with its own metadata and weights.
   * Comparisons are made at the level of patterns, robustness, and falsification outcomes, not by tuning each encoding separately to match a desired low tension picture.

5. Pre registration

   * Any experimental or analysis plan that uses `E_code` to draw conclusions about coding principles must include:

     * the selected encoding type,
     * its metadata reference,
     * the chosen weight triplet,
     * and the thresholds and bands for tension based decisions.
   * This plan must be recorded before analyzing the relevant test data, in line with the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter and the TU Tension Scale Charter.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q083 is characterized as a tension problem in TU.

### 4.1 Core coding tension functional

The core coding tension functional is `Tension_code(m)` defined above. It captures a tradeoff between three aspects.

* How well structured the code is relative to a principled reference family.
* How robust the code is to noise and perturbations.
* How well the code respects resource constraints.

For regular states `m` in `M_reg`:

```txt
Tension_code(m) >= 0
```

Small values of `Tension_code(m)` indicate codes that are close to a chosen principled family, robust, and resource compatible. Large values indicate codes that deviate strongly in at least one of these respects.

### 4.2 Coding principles as low tension regimes

At the effective layer, candidate neural coding principles can be phrased as statements of the following form.

For the actual brain and for appropriate context classes, there exist encoding choices in `E_code` and regular states `m_true` in `M_reg` such that:

```txt
Tension_code(m_true) <= epsilon_code
```

where `epsilon_code` is a small threshold that depends on the resolution of the analysis and the complexity of the task. The threshold `epsilon_code` is chosen in advance using the TU Tension Scale Charter. It is not allowed to grow without bound as more data are included or as encodings are refined inside their pre specified parameter ranges.

In words:

* Good coding principles are those for which plausible encodings exist that keep code tension uniformly low over a wide set of tasks and conditions, without relying on post hoc tuning.

### 4.3 Failure of coding principles as persistent high tension

If a proposed coding principle is fundamentally mismatched to how the brain actually encodes information, then for any encoding in `E_code` that respects that principle and remains faithful to observational constraints, world representing states `m_world` would eventually exhibit persistent high tension.

```txt
Tension_code(m_world) >= delta_code
```

for some `delta_code > 0` that cannot be driven toward zero by refining the analysis, as long as the encoding stays in `E_code`, respects the data, and follows the fairness constraints above.

In words:

* Failed coding principles show up as families of encodings for which tension remains high or even grows when we look at more precise and diverse data, even after reasonable refinement of the analysis inside the allowed design space.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.

* World T: the brain uses coherent, relatively simple coding principles with low coding tension.
* World F: the brain uses heterogeneous, poorly organized codes with high coding tension.

These worlds are patterns of observables and tension values, not constructive rules and not direct claims about our universe.

### 5.1 World T: coherent coding principles

In World T:

1. Code structure

   * For a wide range of tasks and modalities, there exist encodings in `E_code` such that:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_struct(m_T) is small
     ```

     for states `m_T` that summarize recorded activity and context.

2. Noise robustness

   * When noise levels in inputs or internal processes are changed within a realistic range, `DeltaS_noise(m_T)` stays small or grows in ways predicted by efficient coding or similar theories.

3. Resource compatibility

   * The resource mismatch `DeltaS_resource(m_T)` remains within narrow bands compatible with metabolic and wiring constraints.

4. Global coding tension

   * For these states, the combined tension satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_code(m_T) <= epsilon_code
     ```

     across multiple tasks and modalities, with `epsilon_code` chosen as in Section 4.2 and not exploding as data quality or diversity increases.

### 5.2 World F: ad hoc coding patterns

In World F:

1. Code structure

   * For many tasks and modalities, no encoding in `E_code` yields small `DeltaS_struct(m_F)` when fitting brain data without overfitting.
   * Codes appear heterogeneous and incompatible with any simple reference family across contexts.

2. Noise robustness

   * Measured robustness under noise manipulations does not match any set of predictions within `E_code`, leading to large `DeltaS_noise(m_F)`.

3. Resource mismatch

   * Code cost `C_cost(m_F)` is systematically higher or lower than expected from resource principles, leading to large `DeltaS_resource(m_F)`.

4. Global coding tension

   * For world states `m_F` representing realistic patterns, the combined tension satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_code(m_F) >= delta_code
     ```

     with `delta_code > 0` that does not vanish under refinements that respect both data and the encoding rules.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual descriptions do not claim that the brain explicitly optimizes `Tension_code`. They also do not claim that our actual world is World T or World F.

Instead they serve as reference patterns.

* If data and encodings behave in a way similar to World T, this supports the view that coherent coding principles exist at the effective layer.
* If data and encodings behave in a way similar to World F, this supports the view that simple coding principles in the chosen library are inadequate.

In both cases, the comparison is made through observable patterns and tension values. No deep TU generative rule is revealed or used.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments that can test TU encodings for Q083. They do not solve neural coding, but they can falsify particular choices of encoding class `E_code` and associated parameters.

In all experiments below, only states in `M_reg` enter tension statistics. States in `S_sing` are logged as out of domain and are used only to document limits of the encoding and of the data pipeline.

### Experiment 1: Cross modality code reuse

**Goal**
Test whether a single family of codes within `E_code` can achieve low tension across two sensory modalities within the same species.

**Setup**

* Choose two sensory modalities, for example primary visual cortex and primary auditory cortex in a mammal.
* Collect neural population activity and context labels for both modalities under naturalistic stimulus conditions and defined tasks.
* Fix a sub class `E_code_mod` contained in `E_code`, for example sparse population codes with simple temporal structure and a limited number of free parameters. This choice and its parameter bounds are specified in a pre registered plan.

**Protocol**

1. Fit an encoding from `E_code_mod` to visual data to obtain an encoding `E_vis`, including choices of reference code family and parameters, inside the pre specified bounds.
2. With `E_vis` as a starting point, construct an encoding for auditory data `E_aud` that only allows adjustments within a predefined small parameter neighborhood.
3. For both `E_vis` and `E_aud`, construct states `m` from the data and context labels, then restrict to states in `M_reg` by excluding any `m` in `S_sing`.
4. For each such state, compute `DeltaS_struct(m)`, `DeltaS_noise(m)`, `DeltaS_resource(m)`, and `Tension_code(m)`.
5. Compare the distributions of `Tension_code(m)` for visual and auditory configurations under these encodings.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `Tension_code` for each modality.
* Maximum observed `Tension_code` for each modality within `M_reg`.
* Differences between modality specific tension distributions.

**Falsification conditions**

* Before seeing the test data, choose thresholds `tau_vis` and `tau_aud` and a maximal allowed parameter adjustment radius in `E_code_mod`. These thresholds and the radius are set using the TU Tension Scale Charter and are recorded in the pre registered analysis plan.
* If no encoding within that radius yields `Tension_code(m) <= tau_vis` for visual and `Tension_code(m) <= tau_aud` for auditory configurations simultaneously, then the combination of `E_code_mod` and the chosen code family is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If arbitrarily small changes in parameters within the allowed neighborhood produce arbitrarily large changes in `Tension_code` for the same data and code family, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected as ill posed for Q083.

**Semantics implementation note**

All observables in this experiment are treated in a hybrid sense, where discrete spike times and continuous rate summaries are both represented by the activity and code descriptors defined in Section 3.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment does not solve the canonical neural coding problem. It only shows that a particular combination of code family, encoding rules, and tension scale is incompatible with observed cross modality patterns.

---

### Experiment 2: Noise manipulation and robustness

**Goal**
Determine whether observed neural codes show robustness patterns consistent with low coding tension predictions from efficient coding like principles.

**Setup**

* Choose a cortical area where sensory coding has been studied in detail.
* Construct experimental or simulation based conditions where input noise or internal noise can be systematically adjusted while recording neural activity and behavioral performance.
* Fix an encoding class `E_code_noise` within `E_code` that includes explicit expectations about robustness, for example how `DeltaS_noise` should change as a function of noise level. This class and its expectations are specified before examining the noise manipulation data.

**Protocol**

1. For each noise level condition, construct states `m_noise` summarizing neural activity, context, and performance.
2. For each `m_noise`, check whether it lies in `S_sing`. If it does, record it as out of domain and exclude it from tension statistics.
3. For a fixed encoding in `E_code_noise`, compute `DeltaS_noise(m_noise)` and overall `Tension_code(m_noise)` across noise levels for all `m_noise` in `M_reg`.
4. Compare the observed relationship between noise level and `Tension_code` with the predicted relationship from the encoding.

**Metrics**

* Curve of `Tension_code` versus noise level.
* Deviation of the observed curve from the predicted curve, for example by a mean squared deviation measure.
* Presence or absence of qualitative transitions such as sudden jumps in tension.

**Falsification conditions**

* Before analyzing the test data, specify a tolerance band for the difference between predicted and observed tension curves. This band is chosen following the TU Tension Scale Charter and recorded in a pre registered analysis plan.
* If, for any encoding in `E_code_noise` consistent with basic biological constraints and fairness rules, the observed curve lies outside this band for a substantial range of noise levels, then that encoding is considered falsified for Q083.
* If different encodings in `E_code_noise` that share the same declared code family and differ only within allowed parameter bounds produce qualitatively different predictions that cannot be reconciled with the data, the encoding class `E_code_noise` is considered ill posed at the effective layer.

**Semantics implementation note**

Discrete aspects of spike trains and continuous aspects of rates are both mapped into the same effective quantities. All tension computations use these hybrid representations consistently, without assuming any particular microscopic implementation.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment does not identify the correct neural code. It removes some candidates from the effective layer library, which narrows the search space for future work.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block specifies how Q083 structures can be used in AI systems within the WFGY framework, still at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be computed from internal states of an AI model and used as auxiliary objectives.

1. `signal_code_efficiency`

   * Definition: scalar proportional to `Tension_code(m_AI)`, where `m_AI` is a state summarizing internal representations and task context for an AI model.
   * Purpose: encourage internal representations that achieve lower coding tension, balancing structure, robustness, and cost.

2. `signal_code_robustness`

   * Definition: difference in `Tension_code` between clean and perturbed inputs at matched difficulty.
   * Purpose: penalize representations that show large increases in tension under small perturbations.

3. `signal_cross_context_stability`

   * Definition: a signal based on differences in code descriptors for related tasks or domains, mapped into a cross context tension measure.
   * Purpose: encourage shared codes across tasks when appropriate, in analogy to code reuse across brain areas.

4. `signal_alignment_with_bio_codes`

   * Definition: a similarity based signal that rewards internal representations whose code descriptors resemble those extracted from biological data for similar tasks.
   * Purpose: provide a bridge between biological and artificial coding where desired, while keeping the comparison at the effective layer.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that implement these signals without exposing deep TU rules.

1. `NeuralCodeObserver_Module`

   * Role: map internal activations of an AI model into effective code descriptors similar to `C_rate`, `C_temp`, and `C_pop`.
   * Interface: takes activations and context labels as input, outputs code descriptors and simple statistics needed for tension evaluation.

2. `CodeTensionHead_Module`

   * Role: estimate `Tension_code(m_AI)` from code descriptors, possibly decomposed into structural, noise, and resource components.
   * Interface: takes code descriptors as input, outputs a scalar tension estimate and optional component breakdown.

3. `CrossContextCodeConsistency_Module`

   * Role: compute cross context tension by comparing code descriptors across tasks or modalities.
   * Interface: takes pairs or sets of code descriptors from different contexts, outputs measures of code reuse and mismatch.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness to test the impact of Q083 modules in AI models.

1. Tasks

   * Use multimodal tasks that require the model to process visual, auditory, and symbolic inputs and perform related outputs.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline models trained without explicit code tension modules.
   * TU augmented models with `NeuralCodeObserver_Module` and `CodeTensionHead_Module` active during training or fine tuning.

3. Metrics

   * Task performance across modalities.
   * Generalization to new combinations of modalities or tasks.
   * Robustness under input perturbations.
   * Stability of code descriptors across tasks that share underlying structure.

4. Analysis

   * Compare models with similar performance to see whether lower coding tension correlates with better robustness or interpretability.
   * Log tension values and descriptor summaries so that analyses remain auditable and independent of any hidden TU core.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience Q083 encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt the AI with questions about how information is represented in the brain and in neural networks, without mentioning coding tension.
  * Observe whether explanations are fragmented, purely verbal, and lacking explicit description of codes and tradeoffs.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt the same AI, now with instructions to use notions of codes, mismatch, and coding tension as organizing concepts for its explanations.
  * Ask it to explain how neural codes trade off structure, robustness, and cost, and how similar patterns appear in deep networks.

* Comparison metric

  * Evaluate explanations along three axes:

    * clarity about what is encoded,
    * explicit discussion of noise and robustness,
    * explicit discussion of resource constraints.
  * Ask independent evaluators to rate which explanation better matches the structure of known neural coding literature.

* What to log

  * Prompts and responses in both conditions.
  * Any internal tension scores returned by Q083 style modules.
  * This enables later audit of how coding tension influenced the reasoning without requiring any access to deep TU rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components from Q083 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `NeuralCodeField`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: identifiers for neurons or units, time window, and context labels.
     * Outputs: structured descriptors combining `A_single`, `A_pop`, `C_rate`, `C_temp`, and `C_pop`.
   * Preconditions:

     * There must exist well defined summaries of activity and context for the units and time window of interest.

2. ComponentName: `CodeEfficiencyFunctional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: code descriptors, information observables `I_stim`, `I_task`, and cost observable `C_cost`.
     * Output: scalar efficiency or inefficiency score related to `Tension_code`.
   * Preconditions:

     * Lower bounds or reference values for information and cost must be specified for the domain.

3. ComponentName: `CrossContextCodeGraph`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a set of contexts or tasks and corresponding `NeuralCodeField` descriptors.
     * Output: a graph whose nodes are contexts and whose edges carry similarity or tension values between codes.
   * Preconditions:

     * Code descriptors must be comparable across contexts at the chosen level of abstraction.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q084 (`BH_NEURO_MEMORY_STORE_L3_084`)

   * Reused component: `NeuralCodeField`.
   * Why it transfers: long term memory storage must act on existing neural codes. Memory theories can be expressed in terms of transformations of `NeuralCodeField` configurations.
   * What changes: emphasis shifts from immediate coding efficiency to stability and recoverability of codes over long time scales.

2. Q085 (`BH_NEURO_PLASTICITY_RULES_L3_085`)

   * Reused component: `CodeEfficiencyFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: plasticity rules can be constrained by requiring that they reduce coding tension or improve efficiency over time.
   * What changes: plasticity is described as a process on code descriptors and efficiency scores instead of raw synaptic strengths.

3. Q123 (`BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123`)

   * Reused components: `NeuralCodeField`, `CrossContextCodeGraph`.
   * Why it transfers: AI interpretability can treat internal activations as codes and use the same structures to map, compare, and visualize them.
   * What changes: neurons become artificial units or channels, and contexts are AI tasks or prompts rather than biological tasks.

4. Q121 (`BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121`)

   * Reused component: `CodeEfficiencyFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: internal representations of goals and values can be evaluated as codes with tensions relative to alignment targets, for example conflicts between encoded goals and external specifications.
   * What changes: information observables relate to goal and constraint variables rather than sensory inputs and motor outputs.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

For Q083 at the current encoding baseline:

* E_level: E1

  * The effective encoding of neural coding tension is specified.
  * State space, observables, mismatch quantities, and singular set are defined at a level suitable for conceptual experiments.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connecting neural coding questions and coding tension is coherent at a conceptual level.
  * Counterfactual coding worlds and discriminating experiments are described in a way that can be instantiated in simplified settings.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, the following measurable steps are proposed. All of them remain at the effective layer.

1. Implement a prototype that:

   * takes empirical or simulated neural data from at least one modality,
   * constructs approximate `NeuralCodeField` descriptors,
   * computes `DeltaS_struct`, `DeltaS_noise`, `DeltaS_resource`, and `Tension_code`,
   * publishes anonymized tension summaries and analysis code.

2. Run at least one instance of Experiment 1 or Experiment 2 in a simplified setting, for example:

   * comparing codes in two layers of a deep network trained on two modalities,
   * or in two simulated brain areas with controlled coding rules.

Both steps operate on descriptors and tension functionals, not on any deep TU generative process or new axiom.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q083 is expected to serve as:

* The central node for questions about biological neural representations and their tradeoffs.
* A bridge between neuroscience and AI representation learning, via shared code descriptors and tension functionals.
* A test bed for methods that let researchers probe internal codes of complex systems without requiring full mechanistic understanding.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides an explanation for non specialists while staying faithful to the effective layer description.

Neurons in the brain send electrical signals. When many neurons fire over time, they create patterns. The hard question is:

What do these patterns mean, and how are they organized?

People have proposed many answers. Sometimes they say the important thing is how fast a neuron fires on average. Sometimes they say the exact timing of spikes matters. Sometimes they say what matters is the joint activity of large groups of neurons.

In the Tension Universe picture, we do not assume we already know the correct answer. Instead, we treat each possible way of explaining the patterns as a kind of code family.

For any given situation, we imagine:

* a snapshot that describes which neurons are active, over what time window, and under which conditions,
* a set of summaries that describe how these neurons respond on average, over time, and in groups,
* some numbers that describe how much information these patterns seem to carry and how much they cost the brain.

From this, we define a coding tension number.

* It is small when the patterns look like a clean, robust, and efficient code from the chosen family.
* It is large when the patterns look messy, fragile, or wasteful relative to that family.

We then ask two simple questions.

1. Can we find code families such that, across many brain areas and tasks, we can keep this coding tension small without cheating or overfitting?
2. Or do all reasonable code families in our library end up with large tension somewhere, no matter how hard we try?

If the first situation holds, we live in a world where the brain uses relatively simple coding principles, at least at the level that our encodings can see. If the second holds, the brain may use more ad hoc coding strategies, or we may need to rethink our assumptions and expand the encoding library.

This approach does not tell us which specific code is correct, and it does not try to prove a theorem about the brain. It does something more modest but still sharp.

* It turns vague stories about neural codes into objects with clear observables and a single tension number.
* It proposes experiments that can falsify particular coding ideas under explicit rules.
* It produces reusable tools that can be applied to both brains and artificial networks.

Q083 is therefore the place in the Tension Universe where the problem of how neural activity carries information is written in a way that can be tested, compared, and reused, without claiming to reveal any ultimate generative rules.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem and the associated tension functionals.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in mathematics, neuroscience, physics, computer science, or philosophy has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, such as state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds, live at the effective layer.
* No axiom system for TU is specified, and no constructive mapping from physical states to TU fields is given.
* Any references to brains, agents, or systems are mediated through effective descriptors and observables, not through hidden TU core dynamics.
* Any thresholds, bands, or qualitative labels such as low tension or high tension are chosen in line with the TU Tension Scale Charter and are part of the analysis design, not part of the underlying physics.

### Encoding, fairness, and falsifiability

* All encoding classes and experiment templates in this document are subject to the TU Effective Layer Charter and the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.
* Encodings must be chosen and documented before accessing the relevant test data. Post hoc adjustment to force low tension outcomes is not allowed.
* Falsification criteria are defined in terms of observable tension patterns and pre registered bounds. Failing an encoding or a code family at the effective layer does not falsify TU itself. It only narrows the space of admissible models.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
