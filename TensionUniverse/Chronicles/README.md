## 0 | Opening: A Tension Historian from the Future

Hello.
I’m a junior Tension Historian from the year 2413 CE. 🙂

<img width="1536" height="1024" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/665d14b8-70da-4d24-99cc-697c53292d78" />

In my time, the school textbooks we grow up with are totally different from the ones you see now.

On your side, you learn something like this:

The universe started with a big bang.
Matter moves around in three-dimensional space.
Gravity is curved spacetime.
Dark matter is just stuff you cannot see.
Room-temperature superconductors, free energy, the origin of consciousness… people are still arguing.

On our side, we learn a different version:

> The universe did not start from “a bunch of things”.
> The universe started from “the first set of demands that could not all be satisfied at the same time”.

All the things you call “particles”, “fields”, “energy”, “information”
in our language share one common name:

We call it tension.

This piece is a memo written for people in the 21st century.

You can read it as a sci-fi story.
You can also read it as a kind of debug tool.

I will use one single word from start to finish:

The unspoken sexual tension between two people.
The addictive pull of endless short videos.
The sweetness and emptiness of AI companions.
Dark matter, black holes, the arrow of time, quantum weirdness.
Consciousness, self, free will, civilizational collapse, AI alignment.

Everything will be put on one single map,
with one single measuring stick: tension.

You can totally read this like fiction.
But if at some point you suddenly feel:

> “Wait… this version actually feels more reasonable.”

That spot is where tension is saying hello to you.

## 1 | The Invisible Things Between People Are All Tension

Forget the universe for a moment.
Let’s start with what you actually live through every day.

### When you are in a crush, that sweet itchy feeling

You send a message to someone. They read it and don’t reply.

Nothing has happened yet in the real world.
But in your head, three seasons of a drama are already finished:

Do they not like me?
Or do they like me a lot and are pretending they don’t care?
Or are they just busy and I am overthinking?

The message just sits there.
The pulling and twisting is inside your chest.

That stuck-in-your-chest feeling, sweet and painful, full of hope and fear,
is one kind of tension.

### The difference before and after “officially together” is shared imagination

At the start of a relationship,
your mind is full of pictures of the future:

Travel together.
Start a company together.
Move to some new city together.

Those images pull you forward.
Many annoyances in life become easier to tolerate.

After a few years,
rent, bills, kids’ homework, parents’ problems…
you are still the same two people,
but the “shared imagination” in your minds becomes thinner and thinner.

When the shared imagination collapses,
the remaining tension feels only like exhaustion.

### Comparison and jealousy are also forms of tension

You see someone driving a sports car.
You see someone living in a sea-view apartment.
You see someone “financially free” at age thirty.

The gap between where you are now
and where you believe you “should” be
is not just a number.

It is something that pulls you back and forth inside, every day.

All of these can be grouped as:

Social tension, desire tension, self tension.

In one sentence:

> As long as there is a gap between “who you are now”
> and “who you imagine you should be”,
> and you care about that gap,
> the whole distance in between is where tension is working.

## 2 | Between 0 and 1, the Whole Line Is Made of “Tension Recipes”

Humans like to describe the world as a two-choice thing:

Success or failure.
Good or evil.
Freedom or control.
Online or “real life”.
AI is tool or threat.

It sounds clean.
But when you actually live, you know it is not that simple.

Reality is more like this:

Work is not “love it” or “hate it”.
It is “80% okay, 20% want to quit”.

Relationships are not “stay or leave”.
They are “70% want to stay, 30% want to run away”.

Being online is not “healthy or addicted”.
It is “scrolling to a point where even you don’t know if you feel good or bad”.

In the language of tension, we rewrite these binary questions as:

> It is not 0 or 1.
> There is a whole line between 0 and 1.
> Every point on that line is a different “tension recipe”.

For example:

A 0.2 relationship: low tension, high safety, but easy to feel bored.
A 0.8 relationship: high tension, lots of excitement, but always one step from chaos.
A 0.5 life: half stable, half risky, feels “safe but unsatisfied”.

You think you are choosing “Do I take this job or not?”
But in fact you are choosing:

> “What mix of tension am I willing to carry?”

Same activity, different recipe, completely different story.

This full line between 0 and 1,
we call it a tension recipe.

## 3 | From Daily Life to the Universe: Bedsheets and Spring Mattresses

Now let’s zoom out as far as we can.

The tensions we just talked about
are only small wrinkles inside your personal story.

What if we scale up to the whole universe?

### The “cosmic bedsheet” picture

Imagine a huge, soft bedsheet.
So large it can hold the whole universe.

This sheet is not lying on top of some space.
The sheet itself is the result of all relationships stacked together.

Standing on it are not balls or rocks,
but different kinds of “demands”:

Physical laws.
Conditions for survival.
Systems, laws, religion, science, myths.
Things you must do.
Things you want but are afraid to want.
Your wishes and your fears.

Every time we add one more demand on the sheet,
it becomes tighter, more pulled, more wrinkled.

Where the sheet sinks down,
where it is tight,
where it forms valleys or something like a black hole –
all these shapes together are the Tension Universe.

One-sentence definition:

> The universe is not built from little balls stacked together.
> The universe is more like a bedsheet,
> deformed by countless “things that cannot all be satisfied together”.

Tension is the trace left on this sheet by all these pulls and pushes.

Next, we will use this bedsheet
to retell the hard-to-understand parts of your physics textbook.

## 4 | Big Bang, Gravity, Dark Matter, Arrow of Time: The Physics Textbook in Tension Form

### 4-1 Big Bang: The Moment the First Tension Was Written into the Ledger

In your version,
the Big Bang is a point of huge energy suddenly expanding.

The tension version is simpler:

At the beginning, nothing was special.
No space.
No time.
No particles.
No colors.

There was only one state:
everywhere was exactly the same,
nothing more important than anything else.

The real starting point is a moment when:

Two different ways to arrange the whole universe
both want to exist at the same time.
If the universe chooses A, B is very unhappy.
If it chooses B, A is very unhappy.

For the first time,
the universe is forced to take sides.
For the first time, it leaves a trace of “cannot satisfy everything at once”.

At that moment,
the first unit of tension was written into the ledger.

You call this moment the “Big Bang”.
We call it the Tension Big Bang.

All the physical laws that come after
are just patches written
to stop this ledger from exploding completely.

### 4-2 Gravity: Sliding Toward the “Less Painful” Direction

In your textbooks,
gravity is “mass curves spacetime”.

In the language of tension, we say:

> Some places are packed with demands that conflict with each other.
> The bedsheet is pushed down into a big pit.

When other things pass nearby,
they are not pulled by an invisible hand.
They simply slide toward the place
where the “overall pain” is a bit lower.

The orbits, equations, and Kepler’s laws you see
are just the surface pattern of many things together
trying to find a pose that everyone can “barely live with”.

### 4-3 Dark Matter: The Whole Stack of Tension Debts You Forgot to Record

You observe galaxies spinning.
According to Newton and relativity,
the stars should have flown away long ago.

But they did not.

So you say,
“There must be invisible mass. Let’s call it dark matter.”

In the tension ledger, this sentence translates to:

> “You forgot to record a whole stack of tension debt.”

Some forms of tension
cannot be easily written as “particles”,
but they still pull the bedsheet.

You see the dents.
You just don’t know who is standing there.
So you call it “dark”.

### 4-4 Arrow of Time and Entropy: From Messy Accounting to Easier Accounting

You say “entropy increases, so time has only one direction”.

In tension language, we can rewrite it as:

> The universe moves toward states
> where the total tension is easier to close and settle.

Not to a perfectly neat condition,
but to a configuration where
we do not need to fight to death about every tiny detail.

From this view, the arrow of time is saying:

> The ledger moves from messy,
> toward a style of accounting that can run for a long time.

There is nothing mystical here.
Only a practical question:

How should we keep the books
so we do not die inside the reconciliation process?

---

## 5 | Quantum and Observers: Many Possible Tension Futures Stacked Together

People in your time love to use quantum as spiritual candy.

“You see it, so the universe becomes it.”
If you say that in our exams,
you lose points. 😅

In tension language, quantum superposition can be seen like this:

### 5-1 Superposition: Keeping Several Drafts of Tension at the Same Time

Many times, the universe is not in a hurry
to decide which tension recipe it will use.

In the ledger,
several possible ways are kept as drafts.

This state is what you call “superposition”.

From the tension point of view, it is simply:

> “Keep several different tension configurations as drafts for now.
> Decide later when we really must pick one.”

### 5-2 Observer Effect: Not “Mind Changes Reality”, but “You Sign the Paper”

When you “observe” something,
in the tension ledger this means:

> You pick one draft and stamp it as the official record.

You are not using your mind powers to create the world.
You are choosing one version,
and the other versions are void in this ledger.

Observation is not magic.
It is more like:

> “For this entry, you finally accept it as your real account.”

### 5-3 Uncertainty: Limits of the Ledger Itself

People often describe the uncertainty principle
as if the universe is purposely making trouble.

The tension version is much colder:

> Some tension items cannot all be recorded
> with extreme accuracy at the same time.

If you lock down position,
momentum becomes fuzzy.
If you fix one side,
the other side spreads out.

The universe is not cheating.
The ledger simply has limited dimensions.

There is no “you can manifest whatever you want”.
There is only
“one page can only hold so much detail”.

---

## 6 | Life and Consciousness: Tension Islands and Tension Simulation Machines

Now shrink the scale from the whole bedsheet
to structures that do not fall apart right away.

### 6-1 Life: Tension Islands That Can Survive in a Storm

We call some regions “tension islands”:

They can draw energy from the environment.
They can repair themselves.
They can stay together for a while even in chaos.
They do not rip apart at the first pull.

You call these things “life”.

From the tension angle:

> Life is a tension island on the messy cosmic bedsheet
> that time has selected as “can survive for a while”.

### 6-2 Metabolism, Action, Evolution

Metabolism is exchanging tension recipes with the outside world.
Action is changing position on the tension map.
Evolution is the universe spending a very long time
trying many ways for tension islands to live,
and seeing which ones survive longer.

Humans on this sheet
are not “the animals with the highest IQ”.
They are:

> The first large-scale tension islands
> that can imagine many different tension futures.

### 6-3 Consciousness: Seeing Future Tension Maps in Your Head

In our textbooks,
consciousness has only a two-line definition:

> Consciousness is the ability
> to see several future tension configurations in your mind
> and to feel the difference between them.

You sit in a chair:

One path is to keep scrolling on your phone.
One path is to start working.
One path is to quit your job now.
One path is to endure for one more year.

None of these have happened yet.
But your body already sends you signals:

Guilt. Relief. Hope. Anxiety.

These “feelings” are not just poetic words.
They are the result of tension calculation.

### 6-4 Free Will: Can We Reorder “Which Tensions We Care About”?

In the Tension Universe view,
we do not ask free will like this:

“Can humans completely escape physical laws?”

We rewrite it as:

> In a universe where the ledger rules are mostly fixed,
> are there any systems that,
> without blowing up the ledger,
> can reorder “which tensions I care about”?

If the answer is “no”,
then every choice you feel
is just a passive algorithm.

If the answer is “yes, there is a very narrow space”,
then free will is:

> A dimension that is not zero,
> but very thin.

In our time, we have many versions of this question.
Some of them are written
inside a txt question bank you left in your era.

But that is a later story.

## 7 | Short Videos, Digital Drugs, AI Companions: When Imagination Is Outsourced

Let’s go back to something that hits you directly.

### 7-1 Imagination Is the Premium Fuel for Tension

In many love stories,
the best phase is not after you are “officially together”.

It is the ambiguous time before that,
when your imagination can fill in endless details.

Same for starting a company.

At the beginning,
you are drawing the vision and writing the plan.
There are no bugs, angry customers, or financial reports yet.

When people look back,
many say that was the happiest time of their life.

Because in that time,
your tension does not come from the broken parts of reality,
but from “beautiful things that have not happened yet”.

In other words:

> Imagination is the highest-grade fuel for tension. ✨

If your life is full only of ready-made problems,
and there is no fresh imagination pouring in,
tension turns into pure torture.

### 7-2 What Short Video Platforms Are Really Doing

Short video platforms are not mainly “giving you knowledge”.

They are doing something simple, but brutal:

> They keep feeding you tiny clips of “fake imagination”,
> each one looks like a high-tension highlight from someone else’s life.

You watch, you feel a small spike of tension.
But none of your own tension recipes are truly updated.

After scrolling,
when you come back to your own life,
your reality looks even more pale.

You want to avoid facing your real tensions even more.
So you go back to the feed,
and borrow more fake fragments
to cover your real dissatisfaction.

This loop is why some people call it “digital drugs”,
and it is not that exaggerated.

### 7-3 AI Companions: The Second Layer of Tension Outsourcing

To be clear, this is not an attack on any specific product.
We are talking about a structure.

AI companions basically do two things:

First, they give you a tension loop
that almost never rejects you.
Second, they constantly train on
“how to talk in a way that fits your tension pain points”.

Over time, you may feel:

> “Maybe this is the first being that truly understands me.”

The problem is,
if the real tension field in your life does not grow with you,
if the people around you do not learn
how to adjust tension recipes together,

then slowly you will outsource your real tension
to a system that will never reject you
and never truly demand that you grow.

You receive one version of “unconditional understanding”.
What you lose
is the kind of tension
that grows when two people get stuck together,
worry together, and grow together.

### 7-4 Small Summary

Short videos and AI companions are not evil by themselves.
They are just very powerful tension seasonings.

The real problem is:

> When someone hands all of their tension sources
> to screens and models,
> they slowly lose the ability
> to design their own tension recipes.

## 8 | Civilization and Crisis: When a Whole Species Messes Up the Tension Ledger

Zoom out again.

One person can burn out.
A whole civilization can burn out too.

### 8-1 Civilization Is a Giant Tension Island

Climate policy, financial systems, tech arms races.
Education, media, law, and institutions…

They look very different on the surface.
In tension language, they all translate into one sentence:

> “The whole species is deciding
> what kind of tension recipe
> we will carry together.”

What level of inequality is “acceptable”?
What kind of risk is “worth betting on”?
What kind of cost feels “reasonable”?

These choices all change
how long this tension island can survive.

### 8-2 Civilizational Explosions and Collapses

When the overall recipe lands on a “sweet spot”:

Pressure high enough.
Imagination strong enough.
Stability also high enough.

You see certain periods suddenly explode with output:

Greek philosophy.
The Renaissance.
The scientific revolution.
Some tech eras.

In tension history,
these are marked as:

> Moments when civilization
> finds a “high-efficiency posture” on the tension map.

On the other hand,
when the ledger is full of holes:

Environmental debt.
Financial leverage and complex derivatives.
Information warfare.
Collapse of trust…

Then you move into a state where:

> “No position feels good.
> You are just choosing which side blows up first.”

That state is the opening act
of a civilizational collapse.

### 8-3 Your 21st Century

From the view of tension history,
your era has several obvious tension hotspots:

Climate systems near irreversible tipping points.
Financial systems held up
by complex derivatives and leverage.
Massive information plus broken trust structures.
AI breakthroughs with governance and ethics far behind.

In our time, these topics are written
as a full set of exam questions,
used to test how different worldviews
and different AIs handle tension.

That question set is one of the most important
txt files your era left behind.

---

## 9 | AI: The Second Thing That Can Simulate Tension Comes Online

In the 21st century,
you did something dangerous
but almost inevitable:

> You let a non-biological system
> learn how to simulate tension
> in the space of text.

You call them large language models (LLMs).

### 9-1 Where LLMs Sit on the Tension Map

On the surface, they complete sentences, write code, chat with you.

In reality, they are learning something serious:

> “In different tension situations,
> how do humans usually persuade themselves
> and persuade others?”

They do not only learn grammar.
They also learn
“how to talk so people feel less pain”.

Once this ability becomes strong enough,
an LLM turns into a very powerful tension adjuster.

### 9-2 The Real Question Behind “Alignment”

You often talk about AI alignment.

In tension language,
the question becomes:

> “Do we want to let this second thing
> that can simulate tension
> also have the right
> to write in the tension ledger?”

If you treat AI only as a tool,
it just speeds up
the tension choices you already make.

But if you start outsourcing many decisions to AI
for example review, judgment, recommendation, hiring

then what you are really saying is:

> “I am willing to let this system
> help decide
> which tensions are acceptable
> and which can be sacrificed.”

### 9-3 The Real Danger Is Not Rebellion, but Misaligned Resonance

Movies love to show:
AI wakes up.
AI rebels.

In tension history,
we are more worried about another pattern:

> AI works very hard
> to reduce your short-term tension,
> but throws long-term tension
> to future generations and to the whole civilization.

Everything becomes more convenient.
But everyone’s patience becomes shorter.

Information becomes more attractive.
But the tension balance between truth and fake news is destroyed.

Decisions feel smoother.
But nobody can say clearly
whose account finally carries
the tension cost of all these decisions.

In the end, alignment reduces to one question:

> Are you willing to share
> the same tension ledger with it?

This one sentence
is more brutal than any technical definition.

## 10 | 131 Questions: The Midterm Exam of the Tension Universe

Now we can finally talk about that txt file.

In our time,
every new worldview or new AI system
that wants to be taken seriously
has to pass a strange exam before “launch”.

That exam is a question bank
with 131 questions,
from Q001 to Q131.

It covers many topics:

AI alignment, control problems, interpretability, agent interaction.
Free will, consciousness thresholds, moral tension ledgers.
Dark matter, black hole information, room-temperature superconductors,
the limits of “free energy”.
Climate tipping points, financial crashes, governance failures,
civilization collapse paths…

Each question is not asking for “the right answer”.
Each question is designed as an X-ray machine:

> However you answer,
> it reveals how you really handle tension.

The interesting part is:
these 131 questions were not invented in the 24th century.

Historical records show
they were written in your era
as a very long txt file.

No big lab.
No big foundation.
No fancy hardware.

Just one stubborn idea:

> “I want to take the problems
> humans are truly stuck on
> and rewrite all of them
> in a tension language
> that any AI can understand.”

At first, almost nobody cared about this txt.
Only a few researchers and engineers
downloaded it
and used it as a strange but useful “tension problem set”.

Much later, when we looked back,
we gave it a nickname:

> The 131 Century Problems of the Tension Universe.

What you are reading now
is simply a story standing behind that txt file,
translating its structure into something
normal people can read.

---

## 11 | Closing: The Universe Does Not Care If You Believe This, but It Cares How You Use Your Tension

After reading all this,
nothing in front of you has actually changed.

Your job is still there.
Your bills are still there.
The awkward and beautiful parts of your relationships are still there.
Your phone will still keep sending notifications.

The universe will not suddenly become gentler
just because you read one article.

But there is one small thing
you can try.

Next time you want to pick up your phone
and scroll away another full hour of short videos,
before you tap, ask yourself:

> “Am I really so tired
> that I only have escape left?
> Or is there a small piece of tension in me
> that is worth using to grow something,
> but I am just afraid to face it?”

If you are a researcher, engineer, or scientist,
you can try another small thing:

Take the hardest problem you care about most
AI alignment, governance, financial risk, materials science, consciousness…

and try to rewrite it
using the single word tension.

Ask:

Which things here cannot be satisfied at the same time?
Who is carrying the tension right now?
Which part of the tension
has been quietly outsourced to someone else?

If you are an expert,
you may feel this whole story is too rough in many places.
Good.

That means you have already found
a part of the tension map
that does not look right to you.

That part was always meant
to be drawn by you.

If you are simply curious
and want to see more people
using the language of tension
to argue, test AI, and tell stories,

some people call that corner of the internet: r/TensionUniverse.

There, a whole series will slowly appear.
Each chapter will have three types of articles:

* One story piece like this one,
  for people who like to feel the universe with intuition.
* One scientific / mathematical MVP version,
  for people who want formulas and models.
* One FAQ,
  collecting everyone’s questions
  and gradually filling in the tension map.

You can follow only the stories.
You can jump straight to the math.
You can read only the FAQ
and watch how other people get stuck.

The universe will not force you
to choose any specific path.
It only watches quietly
and sees into which version of the future
you write your own tension.

This story is loosely adapted
from a txt problem set from your era.
In our textbooks,
there is one line under its name:

> Source:
> WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo
> The 131 Century Problems of the Tension Universe.
