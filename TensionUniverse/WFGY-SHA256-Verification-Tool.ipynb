        "# Manual SHA256 Verification Tool for WFGY TXT File\n",
        "# ==================================================\n",
        "# Purpose:\n",
        "#   - Upload your local TXT file (e.g. WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)\n",
        "#   - Compute its SHA256 hash manually\n",
        "#   - Compare it with the official hash published on GitHub\n",
        "#\n",
        "# When to use this:\n",
        "#   - When an AI assistant cannot verify the file hash directly (e.g. no direct file access)\n",
        "#   - To double-check file integrity yourself in a trusted environment\n",
        "#   - Useful if filenames differ but you suspect the content is the same\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Official reference (from https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY README):\n",
        "#   - Expected SHA256: 58dbd432db3e6494364557257f7ce068eb59bdd039995dff4c281d655f7d464f\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Instructions:\n",
        "#   1. Run this cell\n",
        "#   2. Click \"Choose Files\" to upload your TXT\n",
        "#   3. Wait for the hash to be computed and compared\n",
        "#   4. If hashes match → your file content is identical to the official one (byte-for-byte)\n",
        "#   5. If not → content differs (possible reasons: edits, different line endings, encoding changes)\n",
