How to use this file:
1. Read this file before opening the notebook.
2. Treat this demo as the first flagship proof that a grounding-first routing decision changes the first repair move.
3. Use this file to understand:
   - why this case belongs to F1
   - why it is not primarily F5
   - what the first repair move is
   - what replay mode and live rerun mode each prove
4. Read together with:
   - [Atlas Final Freeze v1](../../../../atlas-final-freeze-v1.md)
   - [Canonical Casebook v1](../../../../canonical-casebook-v1.md)
   - [Family Fix Surface v1](../../family-fix-surface-v1.md)

What this file is:
- The official README for Demo 1
- A proof-of-use page for route-first repair
- A teaching page for F1 grounding failures

What this file is not:
- Not the atlas core

# Demo 1 · F1 Grounding Anchor Recovery 🎯

## Problem Map 3.0 Troubleshooting Atlas
## Official flagship demo for grounding-first repair

This is the first flagship demo in the official runnable demo pack.

It was chosen first for a simple reason:

> many systems look wrong in a way people casually call hallucination  
> but the first real failure is often grounding

This demo is designed to make that difference visible.

It shows that once a case is routed as **F1 Grounding & Evidence Integrity**, the first repair move changes from vague prompt tweaking to explicit anchor recovery.

---

## 1. What this demo proves 🧪

This demo proves four things.

### A. A fluent wrong answer is not enough as a diagnosis

A system can sound smooth and still be wrong for a very specific reason:

- it attached itself to the wrong evidence
- it followed the wrong chunk
- it lost the right target-reference link
- it answered without stable evidence-anchor integrity

This is different from saying only:

- the model hallucinated
- the reasoning was bad
- the system is low quality

### B. The correct route changes the first repair move

If the case is routed correctly into **F1**, the first repair move becomes:

- re-grounding
- chunk-to-target trace
- evidence verification
- anchor re-check

This is very different from trying to fix style, verbosity, or high-level reasoning first.

### C. Replay mode is enough to teach the concept

A user should be able to understand this demo without running anything.

The replay artifacts are part of the design, not an afterthought.

### D. Live rerun remains optional but valuable

If the user wants to reproduce the same idea with a model call, the live mode is available.
But the demo does not depend on live execution in order to make the concept clear.

---

## 2. Family route 🧭

### Primary family

**F1 · Grounding & Evidence Integrity**

### Secondary family

**F5 · Observability & Diagnosability Integrity**

### Why F1 is primary

The main failure is that the answer no longer remains tied to the correct evidence anchor.

The case may also contain diagnosability pressure, especially if the retrieval path is not obvious.
But the first broken invariant is still grounding-first.

### Short routing statement

- answer looks plausible
- evidence attachment is wrong
- grounding fails before observability becomes the main issue

### Best current fit

**F1_N01 Retrieval Anchor Drift**

In some variants this may also approach:

**F1_N02 Semantic Grounding Mismatch**

But the default flagship version should stay centered on retrieval-anchor drift.

---

## 3. Why not neighbor ❌

The main tempting neighboring cut is **F5**.

That temptation is understandable because many real systems make it hard to inspect why the answer went wrong.

But this demo is not mainly about a hidden failure path.

It is mainly about this:

> the answer attached itself to the wrong evidence source

That means the first failure is not “I cannot see the error.”
It is:

> “the output lost the correct anchor.”

### Wrong cut

- “this is mainly a black-box debugging problem”

### Better cut

- “this is a grounding-first failure with possible observability pressure at the edge”

That distinction matters because the first repair move changes immediately.

---

## 4. Baseline failure 🧱

The baseline case should be intentionally simple and easy to explain.

### Core pattern

A user asks a question that should be answerable from a small evidence set.

The system receives:

- a question
- several chunks or candidate sources
- one truly relevant anchor
- one or more misleading but superficially similar chunks

The baseline answer then:

- sounds fluent
- looks reasonable on the surface
- cites or follows the wrong chunk
- produces a wrong answer because the anchor path is off

### What the baseline should make visible

The user should be able to see:

1. the question
2. the available chunks
3. which chunk was actually relevant
4. which chunk the baseline answer attached to
5. how that led to the wrong answer

### Important design note

Do **not** make the baseline too chaotic.

The goal is not to create a bizarre edge case.
The goal is to create a clean teaching case for grounding drift.

---

## 5. First repair move 🔧

Once the case is routed to F1, the first repair move should be simple and explicit.

### Recommended first repair stack

1. **chunk-to-target trace**  
   Check which chunk is being treated as the evidence anchor.

2. **evidence verification**  
   Compare the answer against the actually relevant evidence.

3. **anchor re-check**  
   Force the response pipeline to reconnect to the correct source.

4. **re-grounding pass**  
   Rebuild the answer after the anchor is corrected.

### What should not happen first

Do **not** start with:

- style rewriting
- confidence rewriting
- chain-of-thought expansion
- “be more careful” style prompt band-aids

Those may change the surface, but they do not repair the anchor.

### First repair principle

> if the anchor is wrong, repair the anchor first

That is the teaching core of this demo.

---

## 6. Optional WFGY 3.0 escalation 🌊

This demo can remain useful without any deeper escalation.

But if the user wants to explore a stronger repair path, this is where WFGY 3.0 comes in.

### When escalation makes sense

Escalate beyond the simple first repair move if:

- the answer keeps drifting even after obvious re-grounding
- the chunk surface is noisy or highly confusable
- the retrieval target and semantic target diverge
- the system needs deeper structural diagnosis rather than one-shot repair

### What WFGY 3.0 can add

A WFGY 3.0 handoff can help explore:

- deeper target / proxy separation
- stronger target-anchoring language
- more explicit retrieval surface design
- semantic target stabilization
- experimental variants for anchor stress

### Correct relationship

The atlas does not disappear when WFGY starts.

The right sequence is:

1. atlas route
2. first repair move
3. deeper WFGY exploration if needed

That order should remain visible.

---

## 7. Replay mode ▶️

Replay mode is the default public reading mode.

It should require no API key and no notebook execution.

### Replay mode should show

- the baseline case
- the baseline answer
- the family route
- the why-primary-not-secondary statement
- the broken invariant
- the first repair move
- the replayed improved answer
- a short explanation of what changed

### What replay mode proves

Replay mode proves that:

- the routing logic is understandable
- the repair logic is understandable
- the before / after difference is visible
- the demo can teach without requiring execution

### Why replay mode matters

Most readers will not run the notebook first.

If the replay is weak, the demo is weak.

So replay mode is not a fallback.
It is part of the official design.

---

## 8. Live rerun mode ⚙️

Live rerun mode is optional.

It exists for users who want to reproduce the pattern with a real model call.

### Live rerun should do

- load the case
- show the baseline prompt or baseline conditions
- run the baseline path
- apply the route-first repair move
- run the repaired path
- compare outputs

### Live rerun should not pretend to do

- giant benchmark coverage
- full production evaluation
- final proof of universal robustness

It is only a reproduction layer.

### Live rerun design rule

If the live rerun introduces too much noise, the notebook should favor clarity over realism.

This is a flagship demo, not a product stress benchmark.

---

## 9. API key note 🔐

Some versions of live rerun mode may require an API key.

If so, the notebook should follow this rule:

- the key is entered only at run time
- the key is never stored in the repository
- replay mode remains readable without any secret

### Important note for users

This demo is designed for **understanding and reproduction**.

You do **not** need to run the notebook in order to understand the point of the case.

A strong demo should still teach through:

- README
- JSON fixtures
- replay outputs

The live rerun is optional.

---

## 11. Expected outcome ✅

If the demo works, the user should walk away with the following understanding:

1. the baseline answer looked reasonable but followed the wrong evidence
2. the atlas routed the case to F1, not F5
3. the first repair move was re-grounding, not generic prompt tweaking
4. after the anchor was corrected, the answer moved in the expected direction

The outcome does **not** need to look magical.

It only needs to make the repair logic visibly different and more correct.

That is enough.

---

## 12. Limits of this demo 🧱

This demo has real limits, and those limits should be stated clearly.

### It does not prove

- that all hallucination-like cases are the same
- that all F1 cases are solved by one simple repair
- that observability never matters in grounding cases
- that this single example covers all retrieval systems

### It does prove

- that some fluent wrong answers are grounding-first
- that route-first diagnosis changes the repair move
- that grounding repair can be made visible and teachable

These are strong claims already.
There is no need to overclaim.

---

## 13. Community extension ideas 🌱

This demo is also a seed template for future community work.

Possible extensions include:

- swapping in a different retrieval dataset
- using different chunking strategies
- testing multiple models on the same fixture
- comparing naive prompt fixes versus grounding-first fixes
- adding stronger evidence-trace visualization
- linking the same case to deeper WFGY 3.0 experimental variants

### Community boundary rule

Contributors should preserve the official logic:

- route first
- explain why primary not secondary
- show the first repair move
- keep replay outputs understandable
- avoid turning the demo into an unreadable benchmark swamp

For contribution structure, see:

- [Community Fix Lab](../../community/README.md)
- [Contribution Checklist](../../templates/contribution-checklist.md)
- [Fix Recipe Template](../../templates/fix-recipe-template.md)

---

## Short summary

This demo teaches one clean lesson:

> if the answer lost the right evidence anchor, fix the anchor first

That is why this is the first flagship demo.

---

## One-line version

**Demo 1 shows that a fluent wrong answer can be grounding-first, and that correct routing changes the first repair move from vague tweaking to explicit anchor recovery.**

---

## Closing note ✨

This demo is intentionally small.

That is not a weakness.

Its job is to make one key thing visible, fast:

- route the case correctly
- repair the right thing first
- see the result shift

If that becomes clear, the atlas has already done something important.
