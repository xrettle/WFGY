## General

**What is WFGY, in one line?**  
A semantic firewall and diagnostic layer that sits above your stack. It measures semantic drift (ΔS), watches stability (λ_observe), and applies repair operators (BBMC / BBPF / BBCR / BBAM). No infra rewrite needed.

**Do I need a GPU?**  
No for first fixes. You can prototype on CPU with light embeddings and strict guardrails. GPU helps with heavy rerankers or larger local LLMs, but it is optional. See: [Retrieval Playbook](./retrieval-playbook.md).

**How is this different from LangChain/LlamaIndex?**  
Those orchestrate tools. WFGY hardens reasoning and retrieval with pre-output gates and measurable acceptance targets. It works regardless of framework.

**License and commercial use?**  
MIT. Commercial use allowed. PRs welcome (docs, patterns, examples).

---

## Getting started & scope

**Fastest 60-second tryout?**  
Load **TXT OS** and the **WFGY paper**. Paste TXT OS into any LLM, then follow [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) for a minimal “semantic firewall before output” routine.

**Where do I look if I don’t know the failure type yet?**  
Open the triage page: [Grandma Clinic (1–16)](./GrandmaClinic/README.md). Each item has a grandma story, a minimal guardrail, and the pro link.

**Which embedding model to start with?**  
General English: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or `bge-base`. Multilingual: `bge-m3` or `LaBSE`. Keep write/read normalization identical. See: [Embeddings](./GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/README.md) and [Semantic ≠ Embedding](./embedding-vs-semantic.md).

**Do I need a reranker right away?**  
Not usually. First prove your candidate pool: if `recall@50 ≥ 0.85` and Top-k precision is still weak, add a reranker. Otherwise fix retrieval shape first. See: [Rerankers](./rerankers.md).

**How big can my PDFs be?**  
Start with a gold set (10–50 Q/A with citations). Ingestion by sections, not fixed tokens. Verify ΔS thresholds before scaling. See: [Chunking](./GlobalFixMap/Chunking/README.md).

---

## Diagnosing failures

**The chunks look right but the answer is wrong. Now what?**  
Measure `ΔS(question, retrieved)`.  
- If `ΔS ≥ 0.60`, fix retrieval first: [Hallucination & Chunk Drift](./hallucination.md).  
- If `ΔS ≤ 0.45` and the answer still fails, it is a reasoning path issue: [Interpretation Collapse](./retrieval-collapse.md).

**Hybrid (BM25+dense) made results worse. Why?**  
Likely analyzer/tokenizer mismatch or query splitting. Unify analyzers and log per-retriever queries. See: [Query Parsing Split](./patterns/pattern_query_parsing_split.md).

**Citations bleed or point to mixed sources.**  
Enforce “cite-then-explain”, per-source fences, and retrieval trace with IDs/lines. See: [Retrieval Traceability](./retrieval-traceability.md) and [Symbolic Constraint Unlock](./patterns/pattern_symbolic_constraint_unlock.md).

**Fixes don’t stick after refresh.**  
You’re hitting Memory Desync. Stamp `mem_rev`/`mem_hash`, gate writes, and audit trace keys. See: [Memory Desync](./patterns/pattern_memory_desync.md).

---

## Retrieval, chunking, and OCR

**Optimal chunk size and rules?**  
Prefer structural sections, stable titles, and table/code preservation. Avoid splitting tables/code blocks. See: [Chunking](./GlobalFixMap/Chunking/README.md).

**OCR keeps breaking layout.**  
Use layout-aware parsing and keep headers/footers separate. See: [OCR Parsing](./GlobalFixMap/OCR_Parsing/README.md).

**Multilingual retrieval drifts.**  
Check tokenizer/analyzer per language and enable hybrid multilingual ranking with guardrails. See: [Language](./GlobalFixMap/Language/README.md) and [LanguageLocale](./GlobalFixMap/LanguageLocale/README.md).

---

## Embeddings & metrics

**Compute ΔS quickly?**  
Unit-normalize sentence embeddings; `ΔS = 1 − cos(I, G)`. Operating zones: `<0.40` stable, `0.40–0.60` transit, `≥0.60` act.

**Why are top neighbors semantically wrong with high cosine?**  
Cross-space vectors, scale/normalization mismatch, or casing/tokenization skew. Audit metrics first. See: [Embeddings](./GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/README.md) and [Semantic ≠ Embedding](./embedding-vs-semantic.md).

**When to switch dimensions or project?**  
Only after metric/normalization audit and contract checks. See: [Dimension Mismatch & Projection](./GlobalFixMap/Embeddings/dimension_mismatch_and_projection.md).

---

## Reasoning guardrails

**What are BBMC / BBPF / BBCR / BBAM?**  
- **BBMC**: minimize semantic residue vs anchors.  
- **BBPF**: branch safely across multiple paths.  
- **BBCR**: detect collapse and restart via a clean bridge node.  
- **BBAM**: modulate attention variance to avoid entropy melt.

**How do I decide when to reset?**  
Monitor ΔS and λ_observe mid-chain. If ΔS spikes twice or λ diverges, run BBCR and re-anchor. See: [Logic Collapse](./logic-collapse.md).

**How do I clamp chain-of-thought variance without killing creativity?**  
Run λ_diverse for 2–3 candidates, score against the same anchor, and apply a bounded entropy window. See: [Creative Freeze](./creative-freeze.md).

**Symbols/tables keep getting flattened.**  
Keep a separate symbol channel, preserve code/table blocks, and anchor units/operators. See: [Symbolic Collapse](./symbolic-collapse.md).

---

## Multi-agent & tool chaos

**Agents overwrite each other’s notes.**  
Assign role/state keys, memory fences, and tool timeouts. See: [Multi-Agent Problems](./Multi-Agent_Problems.md).

**Debug path is a black box.**  
Log query → chunk IDs → acceptance metrics; show the card (source) before answer. See: [Retrieval Traceability](./retrieval-traceability.md).

---

## Eval & acceptance targets

**What to measure on every PR?**  
Commit a gold set and track `recall@50`, `nDCG@10`, and ΔS across prompts. Gate merges on stability. See: [Eval RAG Precision/Recall](./eval/eval_rag_precision_recall.md) and [Eval Semantic Stability](./eval/eval_semantic_stability.md).

**Acceptance targets we use**  
- ΔS ≤ 0.45  
- Coverage ≥ 0.70  
- λ state convergent  
- Source present before final

---

## Ops & deployment

**First calls fail or stall. Where to look?**  
- Boot order issues: [Bootstrap Ordering](./bootstrap-ordering.md)  
- Mutual waiting or locks: [Deployment Deadlock](./deployment-deadlock.md)  
- Cold caches/secrets/index skew: [Pre-deploy Collapse](./predeploy-collapse.md)

**Index build & swap, shadow traffic, rollback?**  
See: [Ops](./ops/README.md) and the detailed ops pages in the [Global Fix Map](./GlobalFixMap/README.md).

---

## Known limits

- Noisy OCR may require manual anchors or char-level retrieval.  
- Abstract cross-domain reasoning (#11/#12) improves with stronger models.  
- Rerankers add latency; prove gains via nDCG before shipping.
