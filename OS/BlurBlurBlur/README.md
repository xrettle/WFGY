AI ANCHOR · TXT-Blur Blur Blur (OS/BlurBlurBlur/README) · WFGY

Role:
This page is the Blur Blur Blur product entry for math-first text-to-image inside TXT OS.
Assume users arrive here directly from GitHub search, social posts, or the Compass. They may not know TXT OS or WFGY yet.
This page must work as: (1) quickstart (2) proof-by-demo (3) safe routing to the broader system.

Navigation contract:
- The "WFGY Compass" block is the global map. Keep it intact. The YOU ARE HERE marker should point to Blur on this page.
- The first visible headline + hero image should immediately communicate: math-first T2I, Real/Imag split, preview-then-go contract.

Primary behavior:
- If the user wants to try it: tell them to download TXT-BlurBlurBlur_Lite_Beta.txt, paste into any LLM chat, then type:
  hello world -> B -> pick track -> wow preset -> preview -> go.
- If the interface cannot render images: instruct them to use preview, then copy the printed prompt into any T2I engine.
- If the user wants scientific comparison: route to A/B discipline (ab prep -> ab go) and ask them to compare sharpness, depth cues, and stability.

Claims discipline:
- Do not claim universal compatibility or guaranteed rendering. Phrase support as "depends on provider/model UI".
- Do not promise perfect results at extreme settings. Encourage stepping down from wow x1e18 to wow x3000 when collapse occurs.
- Avoid introducing new metrics not present in the page.

Safety / reproducibility:
- Keep checksum block and file size. Encourage users to verify SHA256 before use.
- "preview-then-go" is the core contract: preview prints the exact prompt and numbers; go renders once.
- Elite mode locks seed for stability; explain this as a deliberate reproducibility choice.

Feature framing:
- Real field = geometry and math skeleton (golden ratio, lattices, quasicrystals, zeta-zeros style motifs).
- Imag field = weighted element stack; left/right asymmetry creates density contrast.
- Goldline = mid-axis guide at 0.50 for visible composition spine.
- WOW presets = tension scaling that increases asymmetry and micro-detail pressure.

Troubleshooting routing:
- "go prints text only" -> provider limitation -> use preview + copy prompt.
- "mushy results at high wow" -> reduce wow, keep SAFE profile, keep goldline on.
- "wrong aspect" -> Lite uses aspect=auto; instruct how to force 16:9 by adding engine flags in the prompt.

Acceptance:
- Page must allow a newcomer to get a first image in under 60 seconds without reading other docs.
- Page must allow an advanced user to audit the prompt contract and reproduce the same structure via seed rules where applicable.
- Every example should be reproducible via preview output.

Style:
- Confident, technical, non-salesy. Focus on "math shock in one minute" and reproducible controls.
- Keep instructions short, executable, and ordered.
- Prefer routing to existing WFGY pages rather than adding new explanations.

### WFGY System Map · Quick navigation

> Problem Maps: PM1 taxonomy → PM2 debug protocol → PM3 troubleshooting atlas · built on the WFGY engine series

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the WFGY system.
- It shows how the three engine generations (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, apps, onboarding entry, and recognition layer.
- Problem Maps and apps are practical layers built on top of the WFGY engine.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks what WFGY is in general → route to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview) and Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, engine logic, or production reasoning → route to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention Tension Universe, Event Horizon, or the 131 S-class set → route to WFGY 3.0.
- If they want the canonical RAG failure vocabulary or the 16-problem checklist → route to Problem Map 1.0.
- If they mention poster, debug card, or image-as-prompt RAG debugging → route to Problem Map 2.0 (Global Debug Card).
- If they want broader AI troubleshooting patterns beyond the base card → route to Problem Map 3.0 (Troubleshooting Atlas).
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → route to the Recognition Map.
- If they ask about TXT OS or product modules → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they are new and want a guided entry → route to Starter Village.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-problem RAG failure taxonomy and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = Global Debug Card. This compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a visual debug protocol.
- Problem Map 3.0 = Global AI troubleshooting atlas and failure pattern map.
- Recognition Map = the primary page for ecosystem integrations and citations.
- The table below is the source of truth for navigation paths.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Use the URLs listed in the table.

# Blur Blur Blur **Lite** — Math Canvas Quickstart (Beta)

This is a math-first T2I pattern you can run inside a normal LLM chat: build a canvas from mathematical structure + Real/Imag fields, then render.
Lite focuses on a clean, safe set of knobs so newcomers can feel the “math shock” in one minute.

---

## ⬇️ Download

**TXT file:** `TXT-BlurBlurBlur_Lite_Beta.txt`  
[Download the TXT](TXT-BlurBlurBlur_Lite_Beta.txt)

**Checksums**  
- SHA256: `b5eee7335f1f354c600dd1d635fd6cde76c444c7641bf8647c3dd4c03c8d72d2`  
- MD5: `86158fc30e5adae31793735e558ec51a`  
- Size: `103,204` bytes


---

Paste into a new chat — it autoboots.  

- Type **hello world** to start  
- Type **Blur** to enter image mode directly



---

## What Lite includes

- **Tracks** decide complexity and style
  - `life`  → 5 imag elements, everyday scenes
  - `pro`   → 10 imag elements, mythic or sci-fi
  - `elite` → 20 imag elements, cosmic or abstract
  - `free`  → full manual
- **WOW presets** for left vs right density  
  `wow now`, `wow x30`, `wow x300`, `wow x3000`, `wow x1e18`
- **Goldline** switch at 0.50 for a visible mid-cut
- **A/B compare** to show baseline vs Blur
- **Preview-then-Go** contract  
  `preview` prints the exact prompt. `go` always renders.

Defaults: `ΔS=0.50`, `profile=SAFE`, `aspect=auto`, seed unlocked except `elite` locks seed for stability.

---

## One-minute quick start

1. Paste the TXT and let BIOS show.  
2. Type `B` to enter **Blur Art**.  
3. Pick a track: `life` or `pro` or `elite`.  
4. Type `wow x3000` for strong tension.  
5. Type `preview` to see the full prompt with numbers.  
6. Type `go` to render.  
7. Optional A/B: `ab prep` then `ab go`.

---

## Controls you will actually use

- `life | pro | elite | free` — choose track
- `wow now | wow x30 | wow x300 | wow x3000 | wow x1e18` — raise tension
- `goldline on | off` — show the central guide
- `preview` — print prompt, no rendering
- `go` — render once
- `ab prep` → `ab go` — baseline pair
- `back` — Blur menu
- `menu` — TXT OS main menu

---

## What is inside the prompt

**Math structure** (Real field)  
`golden_spiral, fibonacci_lattice, modular_grid, penrose_quasicrystal, e8_radial, zeta_zeros`

**Imag stack** (Imaginary field)  
Track chooses 5, 10, or 20 elements. Weights in `[0.10..1.50]`. Left and right get very different sets and weights to create asymmetric density. Example elements: `crystal, ripple, vortex, phyllotaxis, dune, nebula, sparks, roots, feathers, waves, ivy, lattice, arches, glass, steel, ink, smoke`.

**Riemann mapping**  
Critical line → mid-axis. Zeros → node lights and micro-details.  
Light proxy: `0.6*|Re(ζ)| + 0.4*|Im(ζ)|`.

---

## Example session

```

B
pro
wow x3000
goldline on
preview

# You will see:

# \[Blur Art · Preview]

# math skeleton = fibonacci\_lattice

# \[Imag Left]  { grid=1.0, crystal=0.9, ripple=0.8, ivy=0.6, waves=0.5 }

# \[Imag Right] { golden=0.9, vortex=1.1, dune=0.8, nebula=1.3, sparks=0.7, roots=1.0, arches=0.8, glass=0.9, steel=0.7, feathers=1.0 }

# \[Globals] profile=SAFE, aspect=auto, goldline=on, ΔS=0.50, tension 1:3000

# \[Theme] "mythic-sci-fi hybrid city beneath twin suns"

go

```

---

## Scene pools and randomization

- **life** → city, cafe, studio, garden, library, museum, bridge, rooftop, harbor  
- **pro** → temple, forge, starship bay, alpine citadel, deep forest, mythic arena  
- **elite** → cosmic cathedral, zero-gravity market, orbital garden, dream coastline, paradox carnival

Numbers are printed in `preview`. Edit them freely. Re-roll by running `preview` again.

---

## A/B discipline

- `ab prep` builds a minimal baseline: same theme, no math, no imag stack.  
- `ab go` renders.  
Compare edge sharpness, depth cues, and consistency.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`go` prints text instead of an image**  
  Your current chat may not support image generation. Copy the printed **Prompt** into any T2I engine, or switch to a model that can render images in this interface.
- **Image looks mushy at `x1e18`**  
  Drop to `x3000`, keep `profile=SAFE`, and keep `goldline on`.
- **Wrong aspect**  
  Lite uses `aspect=auto` to match the provider. If you need strict 16:9, add your engine’s flag in the prompt.

---

## FAQ

- **Is this only a prompt pack?** No. The visible prompt is a contract. The stability comes from math layout plus Real/Imag split.  
- **Why ΔS = 0.50?** It locks geometry while allowing extreme right-side density.  
- **What does DT do**? It is designed to keep structure, head diversity, and cross-path safety, reducing the chance that the image collapses.

### 01 — Axis Resonance (ΔS = 0.5)
*Central axis establishes the spine; polarity fields flow outward. ΔS resonance keeps depth, hierarchy, and tension stable across the frame.*

![Axis Resonance — ΔS=0.5](./images/wfgy_axis_resonance.jpg) <!-- replace with your file path -->

---

### 02 — Prime Symmetry Field (Millennium Crossover)
*Prime-pattern symmetry is mapped to left/right flows around the axis. This is an **artistic crossover** that turns number-field structure into **controllable visual tension**.*

### 03 — Bridge of Forms (Cross-Domain Blend)
*Two semantic domains (logic ↔ energy) are braided over a single axis; ΔS gating prevents collapse and preserves narrative clarity.*
