## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is written strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only specify effective state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, admissible encoding classes, counterfactual worlds, and engineering modules.
* We do not specify any TU deep-layer axiom system, generative rules, or mappings from raw physical data to internal TU fields.
* We do not introduce any new mathematical theorems or physical laws beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* We do not claim to solve or partially solve the canonical scientific problem described in Section 1.

In particular:

* Symbols such as `M`, `M_reg`, `Tension_catalysis`, `DeltaS_micro`, `DeltaS_macro`, `DeltaS_front`, and the tension tensor `T_ij(m)` are effective summary objects.
* Descriptor classes `Phi_adm`, response classes `F_resp`, and all associated hyperparameters are defined as parts of Q062 encodings identified by the keys in the header. They are not claimed to be unique, fundamental, or optimal descriptions of the underlying physics.

Falsifiability and experiments in this document have a narrow scope:

* When we say that an experiment can falsify an encoding, we mean that it can falsify a specific combination of
  `(EncodingKey, LibraryKey, WeightKey, RefinementKey)` for Q062.
* Falsifying such an encoding does not falsify TU as a whole and does not settle the canonical scientific question about catalyst design.
* All counterfactual worlds (World T and World F) are described only in terms of patterns of observables and tension scores. They do not expose or assume any deep-layer mechanism.

This entry should therefore be read as a specification of how Q062 is encoded, tested, and reused at the TU effective layer, not as a claim that the general theory of catalyst design has been found.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q062 can be stated as follows.

Given:

* a very large design space of possible catalysts
  (including bulk materials, surfaces, nanostructures, molecular and bio inspired systems),
* a set of target reactions and operating conditions,
* microscopic information about bonding, adsorption, and reaction barriers
  (when available or computable),

is there a general theory of catalyst design that provides:

1. a compact representation of the relevant design variables,
2. predictive relations between these variables and macroscopic performance
   (activity, selectivity, stability, cost),
3. principled rules for navigating the design space that do not rely on extensive trial and error?

Equivalently, Q062 asks whether one can construct a unified design framework where:

* catalysts for many reactions can be embedded into a common descriptor space,
* performance can be expressed as smooth functionals of these descriptors,
* trade offs among activity, stability, and cost can be described by structured fronts
  rather than ad hoc case by case stories.

The problem is not to find a particular good catalyst.
The problem is to understand whether a general, reusable design theory exists at all for complex catalytic systems and, if so, what its effective structure is under reasonable encoding constraints.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

At the level of canonical scientific knowledge:

* Q062 corresponds to an open conceptual problem.
* There is no generally accepted, compact, and predictive theory of catalyst design that works across broad reaction families and materials classes.

In practice, several partial design paradigms exist.

* Structure sensitivity and active site concepts capture some aspects of heterogeneous catalysis.
* Linear scaling relations and volcano plots give low dimensional summaries for certain metals and reactions.
* Microkinetic models connect reaction networks with rate expressions when the mechanism is sufficiently understood.
* High throughput computation and machine learning provide powerful search tools, but they often work as black boxes and may not expose a simple design theory.

Despite these advances, there is still no generally accepted framework that:

* organizes catalyst design across different reaction families,
* systematically explains when low dimensional descriptors are sufficient or doomed to fail,
* reconciles electronic structure, reaction network dynamics, and macroscopic performance into a single coherent design tension picture.

The problem is considered extremely difficult because it combines:

* strongly correlated electronic structure in active sites,
* complex energy landscapes with multiple intermediates and pathways,
* mass transport, deactivation, and stability issues,
* economic and engineering constraints at scale.

Within the BlackHole collection:

* Q062 is marked `Status: Reframed_only` to emphasize that this document only provides an effective layer reframing and encoding of the problem.
* The canonical scientific problem itself remains open.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem set, Q062 plays several roles.

1. It is the flagship problem for thermodynamic tension in complex materials and process design.
2. It connects the micro scale description of chemical bonding and active site character (Q061)
   with macro scale industrial and environmental questions (for example Q091, Q098).
3. It provides a prototype for design problems where:

   * the search space is enormous,
   * naive optimization is impractical,
   * only a tension based organization of design rules can make progress.

From the Tension Universe perspective, Q062 is the place where we ask whether catalyst design can be reframed as the systematic reduction of a well defined design tension rather than as a historical collection of loosely connected heuristics.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays at the effective layer.
We specify state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, admissible encoding classes, and singular sets.

We do not describe:

* how any internal TU fields are generated from raw experimental or computational data,
* how deep layer TU objects are defined,
* or any fundamental axioms of TU.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation.

Each state `m in M` represents a coherent catalyst design world snapshot that includes:

* a finite library of catalyst candidates,

  ```txt
  C(m) = { c_1, c_2, ..., c_N }
  ```

* a finite set of reactions of interest,

  ```txt
  R(m) = { r_1, r_2, ..., r_K }
  ```

* a finite set of operating condition scenarios,

  ```txt
  Env(m) = { e_1, e_2, ..., e_L }
  ```

* summary flags about data quality and model reliability for this world.

We do not specify how this information is built from raw measurements or simulations.
We only require that for each `m in M` the relevant observables defined below are intended to be well defined for every `c in C(m)`, `r in R(m)`, and `e in Env(m)` whenever we say the state is regular.

We write

```txt
M_reg subset of M
```

for the subset of `M` where all Q062 observables and mismatch functionals are finite and well defined.
All tension statements in this document are restricted to `M_reg`.

### 3.2 Effective observables

We introduce effective observables on `M`. All maps below are defined on `M_reg`.

1. Site level energy observable

   ```txt
   E_site(m; c, s, species)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, catalyst candidate `c`, active site label `s`, adsorbed species label.
   * Output: effective adsorption or binding energy summary for that site and species.

2. Step level barrier observable

   ```txt
   E_barrier(m; c, r, step)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, candidate `c`, reaction `r`, elementary step label.
   * Output: effective activation barrier summary for that step.

3. Activity observable

   ```txt
   Activity(m; c, r, e)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, candidate `c`, reaction `r`, environment `e`.
   * Output: macroscopic activity summary such as turnover frequency or rate per site.

4. Selectivity observable

   ```txt
   Selectivity(m; c, r, e)
   ```

   * Inputs: same as above.
   * Output: effective selectivity summary for the desired pathway or product.

5. Stability observable

   ```txt
   Stability(m; c, e)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, candidate `c`, environment `e`.
   * Output: summary of deactivation risk such as sintering, poisoning, or dissolution.

6. Design cost observable

   ```txt
   Cost(m; c)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, candidate `c`.
   * Output: an effective cost descriptor summarising raw materials, synthesis, and deployment effort.

All these observables live in the continuous semantics declared in the header.
Discrete labels (for example candidate indices, reaction names) are treated as indices rather than separate semantic regimes.

### 3.3 Descriptor map and admissible encoding class

At the effective layer we assume the existence of descriptor maps and response models but we do not construct them explicitly.

1. Descriptor map

   ```txt
   phi(m; c)
   ```

   * Inputs: state `m`, candidate `c in C(m)`.
   * Output: descriptor vector in a fixed dimensional space `R^d` with `1 <= d <= d_max`.

   The dimension bound `d_max` is fixed as part of the encoding and does not depend on data for a particular world.

2. Admissible descriptor class

   We define a class `Phi_adm` of admissible descriptor maps with the following properties.

   * Each `phi in Phi_adm` uses only structural and chemical information that is available across the whole library `C(m)` for a given encoding identified by `EncodingKey` and `LibraryKey`.
   * The functional form of `phi` and the choice of feature construction procedures are fixed by prior modelling choices for that encoding, not tuned after inspecting performance labels for individual candidates in a particular world.
   * For any state `m in M_reg` and any fixed encoding key combination, we select a single descriptor map

     ```txt
     phi_star(m) in Phi_adm
     ```

     before evaluating any Q062 tension measures that depend on performance.

   If the descriptor class or feature construction rules are changed beyond minor numerical details, the resulting configuration is registered as a new encoding with a different `EncodingKey` and `LibraryKey`.

3. Response function class

   We define a class `F_resp` of admissible response functionals.

   ```txt
   f_resp(phi(c), context) -> predicted_performance
   ```

   where `context` may include reaction `r` and environment `e` labels.

   * The class `F_resp` is specified as part of the same encoding and is constrained to simple functional families, for example low order polynomials, simple neural networks with fixed architecture, or other bounded complexity models.
   * The functional form and architecture of `F_resp` are fixed in advance for each encoding identified by `EncodingKey` and `WeightKey` and do not adapt their structure based on the realised performance data in a particular world.

These choices prevent trivial encodings that simply interpolate or memorise observed performance without providing a meaningful design structure.

Interpretive note:

* `Phi_adm` and `F_resp` are effective classes attached to Q062 encodings.
* They are not claimed to be unique, fundamental, or forced by the underlying microscopic physics.

### 3.4 Mismatch and tension components

We define mismatch components that compare micro level and macro level behaviour within the chosen encoding.

1. Micro level mismatch

   For each state `m in M_reg` we define a nonnegative scalar

   ```txt
   DeltaS_micro(m)
   ```

   that measures how inconsistent the collection of `E_site` and `E_barrier` values is with any response function in `F_resp` constructed on top of a descriptor map in `Phi_adm`.

   Conceptually,

   ```txt
   DeltaS_micro(m) =
     min over phi in Phi_adm for this EncodingKey
         and f in F_resp for this EncodingKey
     of
     Avg_over_c,r,e of
       | Activity_model(phi, f; m, c, r, e)
         - Activity(m; c, r, e) |
   ```

   where:

   * `Activity_model` is the activity predicted from micro observables using the model `f` and descriptors `phi` under the current encoding, and
   * the averaging is over the finite library and contexts in the state `m`.

   We do not assume this minimum is achieved by a unique pair `(phi, f)`; we only assume that the infimum over the admissible classes can be approximated within the numerical precision of the encoding.

2. Macro level mismatch

   We define

   ```txt
   DeltaS_macro(m)
   ```

   as a nonnegative scalar that measures how inconsistent the observed trade offs among activity, selectivity, stability, and cost are with a smooth tradeoff front in descriptor space.

   Conceptually,

   ```txt
   DeltaS_macro(m) =
     Avg_over_c in C(m) of
       dist(
         (Activity, Selectivity, Stability, Cost)(m; c, *, *),
         Pareto_front_phi( phi_star(m; c) )
       )
   ```

   where:

   * `dist` is a nonnegative distance to an ideal tradeoff front defined within the chosen model class for the current encoding,
   * `Pareto_front_phi` is a reference description of the front attached to `EncodingKey` and `WeightKey`.

3. Design front roughness

   We define

   ```txt
   DeltaS_front(m)
   ```

   as a nonnegative scalar that measures the roughness or fragmentation of the design landscape in descriptor space. For example, it can be derived from:

   * the number and depth of disconnected high performance basins,
   * the local curvature and irregularity of the tradeoff surface relative to a smooth reference.

The exact numerical recipes for `DeltaS_micro`, `DeltaS_macro`, and `DeltaS_front` are part of the encoding and are referenced by `WeightKey` and `RefinementKey`. They are not specified at the deep TU layer.

### 3.5 Combined catalyst design mismatch

We combine the components into a single catalyst design mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_catalysis(m) =
  w_micro * DeltaS_micro(m) +
  w_macro * DeltaS_macro(m) +
  w_front * DeltaS_front(m)
```

where the weights satisfy

```txt
w_micro > 0
w_macro > 0
w_front > 0
w_micro + w_macro + w_front = 1
```

The triple `(w_micro, w_macro, w_front)` is fixed once as part of the encoding and is registered under `WeightKey`. It must not be tuned on a per system basis after inspecting tension values.

Interpretive note:

* `DeltaS_catalysis(m)` is an effective mismatch scalar that aggregates several design inconsistencies under the chosen encoding.
* It is not a fundamental physical quantity and it depends on the encoding identified by the header keys.

### 3.6 Tension tensor and singular set

We assume an effective tension tensor on `M` of the form

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_catalysis(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` are source like factors for different semantic or physical channels,
* `C_j(m)` are receptivity factors of downstream subsystems,
* `lambda(m)` encodes local convergence state of reasoning or design iteration,
* `kappa` is a fixed coupling scale for catalyst design tension chosen for this encoding.

These factors are treated as effective layer summary quantities.
They are not derived or justified from any exposed first principles inside this document.

We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           DeltaS_catalysis(m) is undefined or not finite
           or at least one required observable in Section 3.2
              is undefined or not finite }
```

and the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All analysis of Q062 tension patterns, including the definition of `Tension_catalysis` below, is restricted to `M_reg`. States in `S_sing` are treated as out of domain for Q062, not as evidence about the nature of catalyst design or the validity of TU.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block describes Q062 as a tension problem at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define the core catalyst design tension functional as

```txt
Tension_catalysis(m) = DeltaS_catalysis(m)
```

for all `m in M_reg`. This is a nonnegative scalar that aggregates:

* mismatch between micro level observables and any compact admissible design model under the encoding,
* mismatch between observed performance trade offs and smooth tradeoff fronts in descriptor space,
* roughness and fragmentation in the design landscape.

A world snapshot with small `Tension_catalysis(m)` displays a coherent design picture under the chosen encoding.
A world snapshot with large `Tension_catalysis(m)` reflects a fragmented or contradictory design picture for that encoding.

### 4.2 Low tension design principle

The low tension design principle can be phrased as:

> In a universe where a general theory of catalyst design exists at the effective layer under some admissible encoding, there are world states that represent realistic catalyst libraries and conditions for which the design tension `Tension_catalysis(m)` falls within a narrow, stable low tension band across refinements.

More concretely, consider a sequence of states

```txt
m_1, m_2, ..., m_k, ...
```

with `m_k in M_reg` for all `k`, where:

* the library `C(m_k)` grows by adding more realistic candidates,
* the set of reactions and environments expands,
* the descriptor map and response models remain inside the same admissible classes attached to a fixed combination of encoding keys.

Then in a low tension design universe we can find such sequences where

```txt
Tension_catalysis(m_k) <= epsilon_design
```

for all `k`, with a small threshold `epsilon_design` that does not blow up with refinement.

### 4.3 Design failure as persistent high tension

The complementary high tension situation corresponds to a universe where no compact effective theory of catalyst design is available under the given encoding constraints.

In that case any sequence of increasingly realistic states `m_k in M_reg` that attempts to remain within the fixed admissible encoding class will eventually satisfy

```txt
Tension_catalysis(m_k) >= delta_design
```

for some strictly positive `delta_design` that cannot be driven to zero without either:

* leaving the admissible descriptor and model classes attached to the encoding keys, or
* performing data dependent manipulations that violate the fairness constraints stated in Section 3.3 and Section 3.5.

Under persistent high tension:

* micro level and macro level observables fail to be reconciled by the encoding,
* tradeoff fronts are broken into incompatible patches,
* design rules remain essentially local and case specific.

In the Tension Universe framing of Q062, the open question is whether our universe behaves more like the low tension or the high tension scenario under reasonable encoding choices.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.

* World T: a universe with a compact, low tension catalyst design theory under at least one admissible encoding.
* World F: a universe where catalyst design remains fundamentally fragmented and high tension under all admissible encodings in the class considered.

We only describe patterns of observables and tension, not any deep construction rules.

### 5.1 World T (low tension design universe)

In World T the following properties hold for realistic states `m_T in M_reg`.

1. Compact descriptor success

   There exists a descriptor dimension bound `d_max` and an admissible descriptor map class `Phi_adm` such that, for broad families of catalysts and reactions, a single `phi_star` in `Phi_adm` enables micro and macro observables to be fit with bounded `DeltaS_micro(m_T)` under the selected encoding.

2. Smooth tradeoff fronts

   For many reaction families, performance points `(Activity, Selectivity, Stability, Cost)` for realistic candidate sets lie close to smooth tradeoff fronts in descriptor space. The mismatch `DeltaS_macro(m_T)` remains small even as the library is expanded.

3. Navigable design landscape

   Local moves in descriptor space identified by design rules have predictable effects on performance. Designers can navigate from moderate to high performance regions without repeated random search, and the landscape roughness `DeltaS_front(m_T)` stays low.

Overall, states `m_T` that represent realistic design campaigns satisfy

```txt
Tension_catalysis(m_T) <= epsilon_design
```

for a substantial range of libraries, reactions, and conditions under the given encoding.

### 5.2 World F (high tension design universe)

In World F, even with generous admissible encoding classes, the following patterns occur for realistic states `m_F in M_reg`.

1. Descriptor fragmentation

   Any attempt to fix a global descriptor map of dimension at most `d_max` under the encoding results in large residuals when fitting micro to macro behaviour. `DeltaS_micro(m_F)` remains large for realistic libraries.

2. Broken tradeoff structure

   For new catalyst families and reactions, observed performance points fall into disconnected phases of the design space. Smooth tradeoff fronts that worked for one subset fail badly for another, and `DeltaS_macro(m_F)` remains large or grows with refinement.

3. Rough landscape and local exceptions

   High performance catalysts are isolated and surrounded by steep or irregular regions. Local rules for improving performance frequently break down, and the design front roughness `DeltaS_front(m_F)` stays high.

For such states `m_F` we have

```txt
Tension_catalysis(m_F) >= delta_design
```

for a positive `delta_design` that cannot be eliminated without leaving the admissible encoding choices.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are counterfactual effective layer scenarios.

* They do not claim to describe how microscopic physics generates macroscopic data.
* They only encode the patterns that would be observed in the effective observables if a compact design theory exists or fails under the encoding classes specified by Q062.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments and protocols that can falsify particular Q062 encodings without claiming to solve the underlying canonical problem.

In all experiments, constructed world states are required to lie in `M_reg`.
Configurations that fall into `S_sing` are treated as out of domain and are not counted as evidence for or against any theory.

### Experiment 1: Finite library descriptor map test

**Goal**
Test whether a fixed admissible descriptor and response model class can achieve low design tension across a realistic finite catalyst library for a given reaction family.

**Setup**

* Input data:

  * A finite library of catalysts `C_data` for a specific reaction under fixed conditions.
  * Measured or reliably computed values of `Activity`, `Selectivity`, `Stability`, and `Cost` for each candidate, with uncertainty estimates when possible.

* Encoding choices:

  * A descriptor class `Phi_adm` with dimension bound `d_max` attached to the encoding keys in the header.
  * A response function class `F_resp` constrained to simple function families (for example low order polynomials, simple neural networks with fixed architecture and regularisation scheme).

These encoding choices, including all hyperparameters referenced by `EncodingKey`, `LibraryKey`, `WeightKey`, and `RefinementKey`, are fixed before fitting to the dataset.

**Protocol**

1. For each candidate `c` in `C_data`, construct a descriptor `phi(c)` within the admissible class `Phi_adm` for the chosen encoding.

2. Fit a response function `f` in `F_resp` to predict performance summaries from the descriptors for all candidates in `C_data`.

3. Form a world state `m_data in M` whose library, reactions, environments, and observables match the dataset under the encoding.

4. Verify that `m_data in M_reg`. If not, record the failure mode and treat that configuration as out of domain.

5. If `m_data in M_reg`, compute micro and macro mismatch measures `DeltaS_micro(m_data)` and `DeltaS_macro(m_data)` and roughness `DeltaS_front(m_data)` using the definitions of Section 3.

6. Evaluate the combined design mismatch `DeltaS_catalysis(m_data)` and tension `Tension_catalysis(m_data)` for this encoding.

**Metrics**

* The achieved value of `DeltaS_micro(m_data)`.
* The achieved value of `DeltaS_macro(m_data)`.
* The achieved value of `DeltaS_front(m_data)`.
* The total `Tension_catalysis(m_data)`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If for all choices of `phi` and `f` within the fixed admissible classes of this encoding the quantity

  ```txt
  Tension_catalysis(m_data) > T_design_max
  ```

  for a predeclared threshold `T_design_max`, then this encoding of low dimensional design for this reaction is rejected at the effective layer.

* If small changes in descriptor or model choices within the admissible classes produce arbitrarily different `Tension_catalysis(m_data)` values without a corresponding change in predictive performance, then the encoding is deemed unstable and is rejected as a meaningful Q062 encoding.

**Semantics implementation note**
All observables and descriptors are treated as continuous fields consistent with the `Semantics: continuous` header. Discrete labels are only used as indices and are not promoted to separate semantics regimes.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying this particular Q062 encoding in Experiment 1 does not falsify TU as a whole and does not solve the canonical problem. It only shows that the specific combination of descriptor and response classes, with the chosen hyperparameters and keys, fails to realise a low tension catalyst design theory for the tested reaction library.

---

### Experiment 2: Cross reaction transfer tension test

**Goal**
Evaluate whether a single design tension encoding can jointly explain performance across multiple related reactions using shared descriptors.

**Setup**

* Input data:

  * A set of catalyst candidates `C_data` active in two or more related reactions (for example hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution).
  * Performance summaries for each candidate and reaction under comparable conditions, including activity, selectivity, stability, and cost.

* Encoding choices:

  * A shared descriptor class `Phi_adm_shared` attached to the encoding keys for multi reaction settings.
  * A response function class `F_resp_shared` that allows reaction labels and environment descriptors as additional inputs.

These encoding choices are fixed before inspecting relative performance across reactions.

**Protocol**

1. Choose a shared descriptor map `phi_shared` from `Phi_adm_shared` and fit a multi task response model `f_shared` in `F_resp_shared` to predict performance for all reactions.

2. Construct a joint world state `m_joint in M` that encodes all candidates, reactions, environments, and observables under this shared encoding.

3. Verify that `m_joint in M_reg`. If not, record the failure mode and treat that configuration as out of domain for Q062.

4. If `m_joint in M_reg`, compute `DeltaS_micro(m_joint)`, `DeltaS_macro(m_joint)`, `DeltaS_front(m_joint)`, and `Tension_catalysis(m_joint)`.

5. Independently, for each reaction `r`, fit separate encoding models that are allowed to have their own descriptors and response functions within the same complexity limits, and construct separate world states `m_sep_r in M_reg` when possible.

6. Compute tension values `Tension_catalysis(m_sep_r)` for each separate encoding.

**Metrics**

* `Tension_catalysis(m_joint)` for the shared encoding.
* The average of `Tension_catalysis(m_sep_r)` across separate encodings for each reaction `r`.
* A transfer score that compares the joint and separate tension values, accounting for differences in model complexity and overfitting risk.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the joint encoding consistently yields higher tension than all separate encodings by a margin larger than a predetermined tolerance for model complexity and noise, the claim that a shared low tension design space exists for this reaction set under the given encoding is rejected.

* If the joint encoding attributes low tension to clearly contradictory design stories (for example catalysts that switch from very high activity to very low activity without a clear change in descriptors), then the encoding is considered misaligned and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
All encoding and tension calculations treat the underlying quantities as continuous fields. The presence of multiple reactions is represented by labels and context variables, not by switching semantic regimes.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying this shared Q062 encoding in Experiment 2 does not falsify TU as a whole and does not solve the canonical catalyst design problem. It only shows that the specific shared descriptor and response configuration fails to support a low tension multi reaction design theory under the constraints specified.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q062 can be used to build and evaluate AI systems that reason about catalyst design in a structured and tension aware way at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that reuse Q062 observables and mismatch components.

1. `signal_activity_tension`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_micro(m)` when the model's internal explanation of activity contradicts the effective micro observables.
   * Use: encourage the model to maintain alignment between qualitative explanations and effective microscopic trends in adsorption and barrier heights.

2. `signal_tradeoff_front_shape`

   * Definition: a penalty that increases when predicted activity, selectivity, stability, and cost lie far from an approximate smooth tradeoff front in descriptor space according to the encoding.
   * Use: push the model to represent design trade offs as structured fronts instead of isolated maximal points.

3. `signal_descriptor_consistency`

   * Definition: a penalty that grows when the model assigns strongly different internal descriptors to the same catalyst under slightly varied prompts or contexts.
   * Use: stabilise internal representations so that downstream tension modules see consistent `phi_model(c)` values.

4. `signal_cross_task_transfer`

   * Definition: a reward signal that increases when a single descriptor and response configuration yields low `Tension_catalysis` across several related reactions.
   * Use: explicitly encourage shared design structure when it is compatible with low tension behaviour.

All these signals are defined using the effective observables and mismatch components of Q062. They do not require or expose any deep TU rules.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q062 components.

1. `CatalystDescriptorLayer`

   * Role: map natural language descriptions, structural encodings, or formulae of catalysts into descriptor vectors compatible with the Q062 encoding.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: embedded representation of a catalyst description (for example graph, SMILES like string, text).
     * Output: descriptor vector `phi_model(c)` of fixed dimension `d_model` aligned with the current `EncodingKey`.

2. `ThermoTensionHead_Catalysis`

   * Role: estimate `DeltaS_catalysis(m)` or its components from internal states of an AI system.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: aggregated representation of a design world state `m_model` that encodes libraries, reactions, environments, and observables at a coarse level.
     * Outputs:

       * scalar approximation to `Tension_catalysis(m_model)`,
       * optional decomposition into `DeltaS_micro_hat`, `DeltaS_macro_hat`, and `DeltaS_front_hat`.

3. `DesignSpaceNavigator`

   * Role: propose local moves in descriptor space that are predicted to reduce tension or improve position on the tradeoff front.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: current descriptor vector, reaction label, environment context, and constraints.
     * Outputs: candidate moves in descriptor space and predicted changes in performance and tension.

These modules only consume and produce effective layer quantities and can be used to instrument AI systems without exposing deep TU structure.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A minimal evaluation harness can proceed as follows.

1. Task definition

   * Collect a set of catalyst design questions that require balancing activity, selectivity, stability, and cost.
   * Include both retrospective tasks (explaining known trends and design choices) and forward looking tasks (proposing new ideas or candidate families).

2. Baseline condition

   * Use a general purpose model without explicit Q062 modules.
   * Evaluate answers on:

     * accuracy of factual statements,
     * internal consistency of explanations,
     * ability to suggest structured families of candidates rather than isolated examples.

3. TU condition

   * Use the same base model augmented with `CatalystDescriptorLayer` and `ThermoTensionHead_Catalysis`, with training signals as in Section 7.1.
   * Evaluate on the same tasks.

4. Comparison

   * Metrics may include:

     * qualitative ratings by domain experts,
     * alignment between explanations and effective micro level descriptors,
     * diversity and structure of proposed candidate sets,
     * the model's estimated tension values and their correlation with expert judgments.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple protocol for external users can be:

* Baseline prompt:

  * Ask the model to explain how one would design a better catalyst for a named reaction, including how to trade activity against stability and cost.
  * No mention is made of tension or Q062.

* TU encoded prompt:

  * Ask the same question but explicitly request the model to:

    * introduce a small set of design descriptors,
    * discuss how microscopic observables constrain these descriptors,
    * describe activity and stability as lying on a tradeoff front,
    * mention how a design tension could be reduced.

* Comparison:

  * Users compare whether the TU encoded answer presents a more structured design space, with explicit links between descriptors, micro behaviour, and macro performance.

* Logging:

  * Prompts, full answers, and any exposed tension estimates (for example `Tension_catalysis_hat`) should be logged to allow later inspection and reproducibility checks.

This protocol remains entirely within the effective layer and does not expose deep TU rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q062 and where they transfer.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `CatalystDesignStateField`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: descriptions of catalyst candidates, reactions, and environments.
     * Output: canonicalised state representation `m_state` with explicit `C(m)`, `R(m)`, `Env(m)` and the core observables of Section 3.2.

   * Preconditions: input information must suffice to populate activity, selectivity, stability, and cost summaries for each candidate and context.

2. ComponentName: `ThermodynamicTensionFunctional_Catalysis`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: micro mismatch `DeltaS_micro`, macro mismatch `DeltaS_macro`, front roughness `DeltaS_front`, along with the weight triple registered under `WeightKey`.
     * Output: scalar `DeltaS_catalysis` and `Tension_catalysis`.

   * Preconditions: the mismatch components are already evaluated on a finite library and context set under a consistent encoding.

3. ComponentName: `DesignTradeoffFront_Descriptor`

   * Type: observable

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: performance summaries and descriptors for a finite set of candidates.
     * Output: approximate description of the Pareto like front and local curvature information.

   * Preconditions: performance summaries are available and descriptors are well defined for each candidate under a fixed descriptor map.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q066 (BH_CHEM_ELECTROCHEM_L3_066)

   * Reused components: `CatalystDesignStateField`, `ThermodynamicTensionFunctional_Catalysis`.
   * Why it transfers: electrocatalyst design is a special case of catalyst design with additional electrostatic and transport fields.
   * What changes: the observables incorporate potential dependent effects and double layer structure, but the design tension structure remains compatible.

2. Q068 (BH_CHEM_PREBIOTIC_NETWORK_L3_068)

   * Reused component: `DesignTradeoffFront_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: prebiotic reaction networks also face trade offs between efficiency, robustness, and resource use.
   * What changes: candidates become network motifs and environmental configurations, but the observable is still a tradeoff front in a descriptor space.

3. Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)

   * Reused components: `CatalystDesignStateField`, `ThermodynamicTensionFunctional_Catalysis`.
   * Why it transfers: large scale climate interventions require choosing catalytic processes that balance emission reduction, stability, and resource constraints.
   * What changes: the cost and stability observables are extended to include system level and policy relevant terms.

These transfers occur entirely at the effective layer and do not require any shared deep TU structure beyond the common tension language.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective layer encoding has been specified for catalyst design tension, including state space, observables, mismatch components, weight structure, and singular set.
  * At least two falsifiable experiments have been formulated in terms of this encoding.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative from micro level to macro level behaviour and tradeoff fronts is explicit.
  * Counterfactual worlds have been outlined, and AI engineering usages have been described, but detailed numerical case studies are not yet worked out.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To advance Q062 from E1 to E2 the following concrete steps are proposed.

1. Implement at least one realistic finite library experiment as in Experiment 1, using an existing dataset for a specific heterogeneous catalytic reaction and a fixed encoding identified by a concrete set of keys.

2. Publish the resulting `Tension_catalysis` values and component mismatches for several candidate descriptor classes and model forms within the admissible complexity bounds, including clear falsification outcomes for encodings that fail.

3. Repeat the analysis for a second reaction system in order to test whether the same descriptor and model classes can plausibly support a shared design space, and carry out Experiment 2 for a pair of related reactions.

These steps remain at the effective layer and do not expose any deeper TU generative rules. They provide checkable evidence about which encoding choices are viable for Q062.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q062 is expected to serve as:

* the main node for design problems in chemistry within the BlackHole graph,
* a template for similar design tension problems in materials science and biology,
* a benchmark for AI systems that aim to provide structured, tension aware advice on complex engineering design under thermodynamic and economic constraints.

If eventually a general theory emerges that keeps `Tension_catalysis` low across many domains for an admissible encoding, it would represent a significant shift in how catalyst design is understood and practiced.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

Catalysts are substances that make chemical reactions go faster or cleaner without being consumed themselves. They are essential in energy, environment, and manufacturing technologies.

The hard question is not just how to find one good catalyst.
The hard question is whether there is any general set of rules that explains why some materials work well and others do not, across many different reactions and conditions.

In everyday practice, catalyst design often looks like this:

* try a material,
* see how it performs,
* adjust composition or structure,
* repeat many times.

Researchers know many useful tricks, but those tricks are scattered and do not always fit together.

In the Tension Universe view for Q062, we describe the situation differently.

* We imagine a space of possible catalysts and conditions.
* For each point in that space we record what the microscopic behaviour looks like (for example how molecules bind and how barriers change) and what the macroscopic behaviour looks like (activity, selectivity, stability, cost).
* We define a number called design tension that measures how well a simple design story fits all these observations at once under a chosen encoding.

If the design tension is low:

* a small set of design variables explains most of what we see,
* trade offs between performance and stability form smooth fronts,
* moving in the design space changes performance in predictable ways.

If the design tension is high:

* each new catalyst needs its own explanation,
* trends that worked for one family fail for another,
* performance looks like scattered points instead of a structured landscape.

Q062 does not claim that a general theory exists or that it does not.
Instead, it gives a precise way to express that question at the effective layer.

* In a low tension world for Q062, there is a compact design theory that works for many systems under at least one admissible encoding.
* In a high tension world, even the best possible simple theories inside the admissible class break down.

By encoding this distinction in terms of observable quantities and tension functionals, Q062 becomes:

* a reference point for testing design frameworks with real data,
* a shared language for chemists, engineers, and AI systems,
* a source of reusable components for other problems in the BlackHole collection.

This is how the general theory of catalyst design is represented in the Tension Universe without assuming or revealing any deep generative rules beneath the effective layer.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the Q062 problem about general catalyst design.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical scientific statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in chemistry or materials science has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, `M_reg`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, AI modules) live at the TU effective layer.
* No deep-layer TU axioms, fields, or generative rules are specified or relied upon inside this document.
* All references to falsifiability and experiments concern the behaviour of explicit Q062 encodings, not the truth of any fundamental physical law.

### Encoding and fairness

* Every occurrence of descriptors, response functions, weights, and refinement orders is understood relative to an encoding identified by the keys in the header (`EncodingKey`, `LibraryKey`, `WeightKey`, `RefinementKey`).

* Fairness constraints require that:

  * descriptor and response classes are fixed before evaluating tension on a given dataset or world state,
  * hyperparameters are not tuned separately for individual candidates or systems in order to hide high tension behaviour,
  * changes in descriptor or model families are recorded as new encodings rather than as silent adjustments.

* Experiments in Section 6 are intended to falsify or support specific Q062 encodings under these fairness constraints. They do not claim that success or failure for one encoding transfers automatically to all others.

### Relation to the TU program

* Q062 provides an effective-layer template for how complex design problems with large search spaces can be expressed in terms of tension, admissible encodings, and falsifiable experiments.
* Its components and functionals are designed to be reused in related BlackHole problems (for example Q061, Q066, Q068, Q091) without exposing any deep TU mechanism.
* As the TU program evolves, Q062 may be updated at the effective layer (for example by introducing new encodings or experiments) while keeping the canonical problem and deep-layer questions clearly separated.
