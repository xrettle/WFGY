## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

### 0.1 Scope of claims

* This page specifies an **effective-layer encoding** of Q120 within the Tension Universe (TU) framework.
* It does **not** claim to solve the canonical philosophical problem about the value of information and knowledge.
* It does **not** introduce new theorems beyond the cited literature in Section 1.3.
* It must not be cited as evidence that any underlying open problem in decision theory, epistemology, or social science has been fully resolved.

The only claims made here concern:

* how Q120 is represented as a **tension problem** at the effective layer,
* how this representation can be tested, falsified, and reused in other TU and WFGY components.

### 0.2 Effective-layer boundary

All structures on this page live at the effective layer:

* The state space `M`.
* All observables and fields (`VOI_norm`, `VOI_real`, `DeltaS_info`, `Gap_info`, `K_score`).
* Invariants and functionals (`I_VoI`, `I_align`, `Tension_VoI`).
* Counterfactual worlds (World K and World M).

No deep-level TU generative rules, field equations, or set-theoretic encodings are exposed or used as premises here. If such deep structures exist, they are treated as internal implementation details that merely realize the effective patterns described in this document.

### 0.3 Encoding classes and fairness

We fix an admissible encoding class for this problem:

```txt
E_VoI
```

An encoding in `E_VoI` is specified by:

* A **reference normative model** for `VOI_norm(m; ch)` across the relevant domain of states and channels.
* A rule for computing `VOI_real(m; ch)` from behavior, logs, or modeled policies.
* A **channel role taxonomy** and a **weighting rule** for `w_ch(m)`.
* A choice of **reference scales** `V_ref(ch) > 0` used to normalize raw information gaps.
* Fixed constants and weights such as `alpha_align`, `w_gap`, `w_align`, and the scaling policies for `S_i(m)`, `C_j(m)`, `lambda_factor(m)`, `kappa_VoI`.

Fairness constraints:

* For any given encoding in `E_VoI`, all of the above design choices are fixed **before** looking at tension scores in concrete worlds.
* These choices may depend on decision type and channel role, but may **not** be tuned case by case in response to observed outcomes in order to reduce `Tension_VoI`.
* Comparisons of tension across states are only meaningful **within a fixed encoding**. Switching encodings requires publishing the new choices so that scores remain independently auditable.

### 0.4 Tension scale and bands

On this page we distinguish between:

* **Raw quantities** with the same units as payoffs, for example `VOI_norm` and `VOI_real`.
* **Normalized tension scores** that are dimensionless and lie in `[0, 1]`.

The tension scale is defined as follows.

1. For each channel `ch` we fix an encoding-level reference scale

   ```txt
   V_ref(ch) > 0
   ```

   which represents a characteristic upper bound for normative value of information for that channel type in the design domain.

2. For a state `m` and channel `ch` we define the raw information gap

   ```txt
   Gap_info_raw(m; ch) = max(0, VOI_norm(m; ch) - VOI_real(m; ch))
   ```

3. We then define the **normalized channel-level tension**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_info(m; ch) = min(1, Gap_info_raw(m; ch) / V_ref(ch))
   ```

   which is dimensionless and lies in `[0, 1]`.

4. The aggregate normalized gap for a state is

   ```txt
   Gap_info(m) = sum over ch in L_channels(m) of w_ch(m) * DeltaS_info(m; ch)
   ```

   with `Gap_info(m)` in `[0, 1]`.

5. The invariants

   ```txt
   I_VoI(m)
   I_align(m)
   ```

   and the core functional

   ```txt
   Tension_VoI(m)
   ```

   are defined so that they are **dimensionless** and lie in `[0, 1]`. They are the only scores used to define low-tension and high-tension bands on this page.

We also fix encoding-level band markers

```txt
epsilon_VoI in (0, 1)
delta_VoI  in (0, 1),  with  0 < epsilon_VoI < delta_VoI <= 1
```

These are part of the encoding specification and are not tuned per dataset.

### 0.5 Semantics regime

The metadata field `Semantics: hybrid` is implemented as follows:

* Discrete structures (for example `A(m)`, `L_channels(m)`, `L_world(m)`) are treated as finite combinatorial objects.
* Payoffs, normative value of information, realized value of information, and tension scores are treated as real-valued summaries.
* No claims are made about deep-level semantics of probability, value, or knowledge beyond what is imported from other nodes such as Q119.

The hybrid regime is therefore:

* discrete decision and channel structure,
* continuous payoff and tension summaries,
* all at the effective layer.

### 0.6 Relation to TU charters

This page is written to be consistent with:

* The **TU Effective Layer Charter** for what counts as an effective-layer description.
* The **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter** for how admissible encoding classes and weight rules must be chosen and audited.
* The **TU Tension Scale Charter** for how normalized tension scores and band markers are defined.

It should be read together with those charters for full context on the design constraints imposed on `E_VoI`.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical question behind Q120 can be stated as follows:

> What is the fundamental role of information and knowledge in guiding action and determining value, and how should their value be measured and compared across contexts, agents, and time?

More concretely, Q120 asks for a unified account that answers at least three tightly coupled subquestions.

1. **Normative value of information**

   * Given an agent with preferences and uncertainty about the world, how should the value of additional information be defined across:

     * one shot decisions,
     * sequential decisions,
     * multi agent and institutional settings?
   * When, if ever, is more information strictly harmful rather than merely irrelevant or costly?

2. **Knowledge versus mere information**

   * How should we distinguish between:

     * raw information (for example data, signals, messages),
     * beliefs,
     * justified beliefs,
     * knowledge?
   * In which sense does knowledge, if it is more than just high quality information, change the structure of action and value?

3. **Global role in value and agency**

   * Can we regard information and knowledge as:

     * a fundamental “currency” of rational agency,
     * a basic determinant of long run value,
     * or only as instrumental tools that derive their value entirely from other goods?

The tension arises because standard decision theoretic definitions, epistemological theories of knowledge, and real-world uses of information in institutions and AI systems often diverge in how they assess the worth and role of information.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Several mature partial frameworks exist.

* Bayesian decision theory and expected utility models give precise definitions of the value of information for idealized agents in stylized settings.
* Epistemology offers multiple competing accounts of knowledge and justification, including reliabilist, evidentialist, and knowledge first approaches.
* Economic and social theories study information as a resource in markets, institutions, and technology.

However, there is no widely accepted unified account that:

* simultaneously handles:

  * individual decision making,
  * collective and institutional behavior,
  * long run civilization scale value,
* and cleanly reconciles:

  * formal value-of-information calculus,
  * philosophical accounts of knowledge,
  * observed failures and pathologies in real-world information ecosystems.

For the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q120 is treated as an open, high rank problem because any serious attempt to align AI and socio-technical systems with human values must implicitly or explicitly solve some version of it.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole graph, Q120 plays three roles.

1. It anchors the **value of information cluster** in philosophy, connecting decision theory, epistemology, and global value questions.
2. It provides a reference node for how TU encodes **incentive_tension** around information and knowledge in socio-technical systems.
3. It supplies reusable components for downstream problems about AGI alignment, interpretability, and multi agent systems, where mis-valued information and knowledge can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q120 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge includes a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension feature.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or tools that Q120 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q115 (BH_PHIL_INDUCTION_UNDERDETERMINATION_L3_115)
  Reason: Supplies the treatment of inductive support and underdetermination that Q120 reuses when defining normative value-of-information baselines.

* Q116 (BH_PHIL_CONFIRMATION_EVIDENCE_L3_116)
  Reason: Provides the structure of evidential support and confirmation that informs how information updates are evaluated in Q120.

* Q118 (BH_PHIL_LOGIC_BOUNDS_L3_118)
  Reason: Constrains the logical environment in which information and knowledge are evaluated and compared.

* Q119 (BH_PHIL_MEANING_OF_PROBABILITY_L3_119)
  Reason: Supplies the interpretation of probability that Q120 must adopt when defining expected value of information and epistemic risk.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q120 components or depend on its tension structure.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_TRUST_L3_121)
  Reason: Reuses the ValueOfInformationGap functional to quantify when an AGI system undervalues alignment critical information provided by humans.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Uses Q120’s KnowledgeStateField to treat interpretability tools as information channels about internal AI states with measurable value.

* Q124 (BH_AI_MULTIAGENT_ALIGNMENT_L3_124)
  Reason: Reuses the InformationChannelLibrary to analyze mis-valued information in multi agent negotiation and coordination settings.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar incentive_tension structure but have no direct component dependence.

* Q111 (BH_PHIL_MIND_BODY_L3_111)
  Reason: Both Q111 and Q120 involve how internal states matter for action, but without sharing explicit value-of-information functionals.

* Q114 (BH_PHIL_MORAL_REALISM_L3_114)
  Reason: Both introduce tension between how things are and how they guide action and value, but with different focus (moral facts versus informational states).

* Q117 (BH_PHIL_SCIENTIFIC_REALISM_L3_117)
  Reason: Both grapple with how theoretical states should be weighed in determining rational action.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q120 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses the ValueOfInformationGap functional to compare informational and energetic costs in information theoretic thermodynamics.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: Uses Q120’s framing to quantify how mis-valued information about planetary systems contributes to Anthropocene scale misalignment.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_TRUST_L3_121)
  Reason: Connects epistemic trust in AGI to the valuation of alignment relevant information in human–AI interaction loops.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Treats interpretability artifacts as information channels whose value can be scored using Q120’s components.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or explicit mappings from raw data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following effective interpretation.

* Each element `m` in `M` is a coherent “decision and information configuration” for one agent or institution in one situation. It includes:

  * a finite set of available actions `A(m)`,
  * a finite library of potential information channels `L_channels(m)`,
  * a finite library of world hypothesis summaries `L_world(m)` (for example high-level scenarios),
  * a coarse description of the agent’s current belief state and preference structure.

We do not specify how these objects are constructed from raw logs or psychological states. We only require that:

* For each `m` in `M`, the sets `A(m)`, `L_channels(m)`, and `L_world(m)` are finite and well defined.
* For each action and world hypothesis there is a well defined payoff summary in real numbers.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`.

1. Normative value of information for a channel

   ```txt
   VOI_norm(m; ch) in R
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` in `M` and a channel `ch` in `L_channels(m)`.
   * Output: a real number representing the normative expected value of using channel `ch` before acting, given a reference model of:

     * the agent’s preferences,
     * probabilities over `L_world(m)`,
     * and how `ch` would update those probabilities.

   Constraints:

   * `VOI_norm` is finite for all channels in the design domain.
   * It is evaluated by a consistent reference model that is fixed at the encoding level and is not tuned per outcome.

2. Realized value of information for a channel

   ```txt
   VOI_real(m; ch) in R
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a channel `ch`.
   * Output: a real number representing the effective value the agent actually obtains from `ch`, given:

     * their real belief updating behavior,
     * attention limits,
     * institutional constraints.

   At the effective layer we treat `VOI_real` as a well defined summary that can be estimated or modeled without specifying internal cognitive details.

3. Raw information gap

   ```txt
   Gap_info_raw(m; ch) = max(0, VOI_norm(m; ch) - VOI_real(m; ch))
   ```

   This is nonnegative and measured in the same units as the payoffs. It represents the amount of normative value that is not realized in practice for channel `ch` in state `m`.

4. Normalized channel level tension

   For each channel type we fix a positive reference scale `V_ref(ch)` as described in Section 0.4. The normalized channel level tension is

   ```txt
   DeltaS_info(m; ch) = min(1, Gap_info_raw(m; ch) / V_ref(ch))
   ```

   which is dimensionless and lies in `[0, 1]`. It is intended to capture how large the unrealized value is relative to what is considered a significant gap for that channel type.

5. Channel weight observable

   For each state `m` we define normalized, fixed weights

   ```txt
   w_ch(m) >= 0   for ch in L_channels(m)
   sum over ch in L_channels(m) of w_ch(m) = 1
   ```

   These weights encode how important each channel is for the situation type. They are determined by a rule that depends only on:

   * the type of decision,
   * the role of the channel (for example safety critical, convenience, cosmetic),

   and are fixed at the encoding level. They do not depend on observed outcomes or on `VOI_norm` or `VOI_real` values for the specific instance.

6. Aggregate normalized information gap

   The aggregate normalized gap for a state is

   ```txt
   Gap_info(m) = sum over ch in L_channels(m) of w_ch(m) * DeltaS_info(m; ch)
   ```

   This is again dimensionless and lies in `[0, 1]`.

7. Knowledge state observable

   ```txt
   K_score(m) in [0, 1]
   ```

   * A scalar that summarizes how close the agent’s state is to a reference “knowledgeable” baseline for that situation, with:

     * `K_score(m) = 1` meaning fully aligned with the reference knowledge profile,
     * `K_score(m) = 0` meaning severe ignorance or mis-knowledge.

   We only require that `K_score` is well defined on the regular domain and can be estimated from external behavior or assessments.

### 3.3 Effective tension tensor components

We define an aggregate information tension score at the state level:

```txt
I_VoI(m) = Gap_info(m)
```

which lies in `[0, 1]` by construction.

We also define an effective semantic information tension tensor over `M`:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * Gap_info(m) * lambda_factor(m) * kappa_VoI
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source factor describing how strongly source component `i` (for example safety critical decisions, long horizon planning) depends on correctly valued information in state `m`.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity factor describing how sensitive downstream component `j` (for example long term value, institutional stability) is to mis-valued information.
* `Gap_info(m)` is the aggregate normalized information gap defined above.
* `lambda_factor(m)` is a convergence state factor in a fixed bounded range, indicating whether local reasoning processes in `m` are convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic.
* `kappa_VoI` is a fixed positive scaling constant for Q120 encodings.

The families `S_i`, `C_j`, the range of `lambda_factor`, and the value of `kappa_VoI` are part of the encoding choice in `E_VoI` and must be fixed prior to evaluation. The tensor `T_ij(m)` is an auxiliary object; only the scalar scores defined in Sections 3.4 and 4 are used to define low and high tension bands.

### 3.4 Invariants and effective constraints

We define two simple invariants on `M`.

1. Aggregate information tension invariant

   ```txt
   I_VoI(m) = Gap_info(m)
   ```

   This is the main information tension score for the state `m`. It lies in `[0, 1]`. For well functioning agents we expect `I_VoI(m)` to remain in a low band as described later.

2. Knowledge and information alignment invariant

   Let `alpha_align` be a fixed constant in `(0, 1]` chosen at the encoding level. Define

   ```txt
   I_align(m) = max(0, Gap_info(m) - alpha_align * (1 - K_score(m)))
   ```

   Because `Gap_info(m)` and `K_score(m)` are both in `[0, 1]` and `alpha_align` is at most one, we have `I_align(m)` in `[0, 1]`. This invariant is small when:

   * information gaps are small, or
   * knowledge is low but in ways that do not induce large information gaps (for example honest ignorance in low stakes contexts).

   It is large when there is both mis-valued information and substantial deviation from the reference knowledge profile.

All of these definitions are part of the encoding in `E_VoI` and must be fixed prior to applying the framework to specific worlds or experiments.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or non-finite if:

* payoffs are not well summarized,
* `VOI_norm(m; ch)` or `VOI_real(m; ch)` or `V_ref(ch)` cannot be assigned finite values,
* `K_score(m)` is not meaningfully defined.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  there exists ch in L_channels(m) such that
  VOI_norm(m; ch), VOI_real(m; ch), or V_ref(ch) is undefined or non-finite,
  or K_score(m) is undefined
}
```

We impose the following domain restriction.

* All Q120 tension analysis is carried out only on the regular domain

  ```txt
  M_reg = M \ S_sing
  ```

* Whenever an experiment or protocol encounters a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as “out of domain” for Q120 encoding and not as evidence about the underlying philosophical problem or about the validity of the encoding in `E_VoI`.

Encodings that cannot guarantee that `Gap_info(m)` and `Tension_VoI(m)` are finite on their intended design domain are not considered members of `E_VoI`.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define the core tension functional for Q120 as:

```txt
Tension_VoI(m) = w_gap * I_VoI(m) + w_align * I_align(m)
```

with

```txt
w_gap  >= 0
w_align >= 0
w_gap + w_align = 1
```

and both weights fixed at the encoding level.

Properties:

* `Tension_VoI(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`.
* Because `I_VoI(m)` and `I_align(m)` are in `[0, 1]`, `Tension_VoI(m)` is also in `[0, 1]`.
* `Tension_VoI(m)` is small when:

  * high value channels are appropriately used and integrated,
  * knowledge is in reasonable alignment with the reference profile.
* `Tension_VoI(m)` grows when:

  * important channels are ignored or mis-used,
  * knowledge is distorted in ways that systematically misdirect action or value.

### 4.2 Low-tension principle

At the effective layer, the “good” version of Q120 can be phrased as a low-tension principle:

> In well functioning agents and institutions, across a wide range of situations, world representing states lie in a low tension band for `Tension_VoI`, after controlling for costs and constraints.

Formally, for a chosen encoding in `E_VoI` (fixed choice of:

* reference `VOI_norm` model,
* channel libraries and weight rules,
* knowledge baselines,
* normalization constants and band markers),

we expect that for many world representing states `m_good`:

```txt
Tension_VoI(m_good) <= epsilon_VoI
```

for some small `epsilon_VoI` in `(0, 1)` that does not grow without bound as we refine the encoding or observe more behavior.

### 4.3 Persistent high tension as failure of value of information

In contrast, we say that a configuration exhibits persistent high tension if, under the same encoding in `E_VoI`, there exist world representing states `m_bad` such that:

```txt
Tension_VoI(m_bad) >= delta_VoI
```

for some strictly positive `delta_VoI` that cannot be made arbitrarily small by:

* refining the representation of channels,
* improving estimates of `VOI_real`,
* or mildly adjusting the fixed weight rule, band markers, or knowledge baselines,

while still staying faithful to observed actions and outcomes.

At the effective layer, Q120 then partitions the space of socio-technical configurations into:

* low-tension worlds where information and knowledge are valued in ways that broadly match their normative roles,
* high-tension worlds where the mismatch is systematic and cannot be explained away by modeling artifacts.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds strictly at the effective layer:

* World K: knowledge and information are systematically well valued.
* World M: knowledge and information are systematically mis-valued.

In both cases we only talk about patterns of `I_VoI`, `I_align`, and `Tension_VoI` within `E_VoI`. No metaphysical claims are made.

### 5.1 World K (knowledge aligned, low information tension)

In World K:

1. For a wide range of high stakes situations there exist world representing states `m_K` in `M_reg` such that

   ```txt
   I_VoI(m_K)   is small
   I_align(m_K) is small
   ```

   and hence `Tension_VoI(m_K)` lies below `epsilon_VoI` for the chosen encoding.

2. When new channels are introduced, high value ones are quickly integrated and low value or harmful ones are eventually down weighted or removed, leading to

   ```txt
   Tension_VoI(m_K_new) <= Tension_VoI(m_K_old)
   ```

   on average across similar situations, after accounting for costs.

3. Knowledge baselines evolve in ways that reduce long run information gaps rather than increasing them.

4. Incentive structures are at least partly aligned with the proper valuation of information, so that ignoring high value information is discouraged and rewarded less than using it.

### 5.2 World M (mis-valued information, high information tension)

In World M:

1. There exist many world representing states `m_M` in `M_reg` such that

   ```txt
   I_VoI(m_M)   is large
   I_align(m_M) is large
   ```

   especially in safety critical or long run contexts, and hence `Tension_VoI(m_M)` lies above `delta_VoI`.

2. High value channels are systematically ignored, distrusted, or underused, while low value or misleading channels are amplified, leading to persistent

   ```txt
   Gap_info(m_M) >= delta_gap
   ```

   for some positive `delta_gap` within `[0, 1]`.

3. Knowledge baselines are distorted in ways that make it easier to maintain high information gaps, for example entrenched misinformation or structural ignorance.

4. Incentive structures reward behavior that increases or preserves information gaps, such as exploiting others’ ignorance or optimizing for short term metrics that ignore long run value.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are not claims about our actual universe. They are templates for how:

* low tension configurations,
* high tension configurations

would look in terms of observables without specifying any deep-level generative rules of TU.

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of the Q120 encoding,
* discriminate between different choices of encoding parameters within `E_VoI`,
* provide evidence about whether a given socio-technical configuration behaves more like World K or World M.

None of these experiments prove or disprove any philosophical thesis. They only test the Q120 encoding at the effective layer.

All experiments in this section are restricted to:

* encodings in `E_VoI`, and
* states `m` in the regular domain `M_reg`.

Any scenario whose summary falls into `S_sing` is treated as out of domain and is excluded from tension statistics.

### Experiment 1: Human decision tasks with controlled value of information

**Goal**
Test whether the ValueOfInformationGap functional and `Tension_VoI` track actual human behavior in controlled decision tasks.

**Setup**

* Design a finite set of decision scenarios for human participants, each with:

  * a small set of actions,
  * explicit probabilistic outcomes and payoffs known to experimenters,
  * one or more information channels that participants can optionally consult at some cost.
* For each scenario, use a fixed normative model in `E_VoI` to compute `VOI_norm(m; ch)` for each channel.
* Collect participant choices about:

  * whether to query each channel,
  * which actions to take.

**Protocol**

1. For each participant and scenario, construct an effective state `m_data` in `M_reg` that summarizes:

   * the available actions and channels,
   * payoffs as specified,
   * the participant’s observed information choices and actions.

2. Estimate `VOI_real(m_data; ch)` from behavior, for example by:

   * comparing choices with and without access to `ch`,
   * evaluating realized payoffs and inferable strategy changes.

3. Compute `Gap_info_raw(m_data; ch)`, `DeltaS_info(m_data; ch)`, `Gap_info(m_data)`, `I_VoI(m_data)`, `I_align(m_data)`, and `Tension_VoI(m_data)`.

4. Aggregate these scores across scenarios and participants, and compare them with independent assessments of:

   * how “rational” participants’ information use appears,
   * whether they are ignoring clearly valuable information.

**Metrics**

* Correlation between `Tension_VoI(m_data)` and independent expert ratings of misused information.
* Average `Tension_VoI` in scenarios where human behavior is widely considered good versus poor.
* Stability of `Tension_VoI` under small changes in modeling assumptions that keep the encoding within `E_VoI`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If across many scenarios it is not possible to choose fixed weight rules and reference models (within `E_VoI`) such that high `Tension_VoI` corresponds reliably to widely recognized misuses of information and low `Tension_VoI` to good use, then the current encoding of `Gap_info`, `I_VoI`, `I_align`, and `Tension_VoI` is considered falsified for Q120.
* If small, pre declared changes in encoding parameters within `E_VoI` produce arbitrary reversals in the ordering of `Tension_VoI` across the same behaviors, the encoding is deemed unstable and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
States are represented using finite sets of actions, channels, and scenarios, with payoffs and VOI values treated as real numbers and tension scores treated as dimensionless quantities in `[0, 1]`. This matches the hybrid setting where discrete decisions interact with continuous payoff summaries.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding for Q120 does not solve the canonical philosophical problem. It only shows that certain effective-layer encodings in `E_VoI` fail to capture recognized patterns of good and bad information use.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q120 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

Given an encoding in `E_VoI` and a state `m` in `M_reg`, we can define the following training signals.

1. `signal_voi_gap`

   * Definition: a nonnegative scalar signal equal to `I_VoI(m) = Gap_info(m)` in `[0, 1]`.
   * Purpose: penalize policies and internal representations that consistently leave large normalized information gaps.

2. `signal_knowledge_alignment`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to `I_align(m)`, also in `[0, 1]`.
   * Purpose: encourage models to bring their effective knowledge state closer to the reference baseline in ways that reduce information gaps.

3. `signal_channel_usage_efficiency`

   * Definition: a ratio like signal comparing aggregate realized information value to aggregate normative value, for example

     ```txt
     Eff_info(m) = 1 - Gap_info(m)
     ```

     or a similar monotone transformation staying in `[0, 1]`.
   * Purpose: reward efficient selection and use of high value channels and discourage overuse of low value channels.

4. `signal_long_horizon_information_safety`

   * Definition: a signal that increases when a model’s information usage pattern leads to high `Tension_VoI(m)` in simulated long horizon scenarios, especially safety critical ones.
   * Purpose: integrate Q120 tension measures into safety oriented training loops.

Training loops that use these signals must treat the underlying encoding (including `VOI_norm`, weight rules, normalization constants, and band markers) as fixed and auditable. It is not permitted to adjust the encoding itself during training in order to make `Tension_VoI` appear artificially low.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

1. `VoI_Estimator_Head`

   * Role: a module that estimates `VOI_norm(m; ch)` and `VOI_real(m; ch)` for candidate channels from internal representations of the current context.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: context embeddings and channel descriptors.
     * Outputs: estimates for `VOI_norm`, `VOI_real`, `Gap_info_raw`, `DeltaS_info`, `Gap_info`, and `I_VoI`.

2. `Knowledge_Gap_Monitor`

   * Role: a module that maintains an approximate `K_score(m)` for the model’s understanding of the current domain.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: task history summaries and assessment signals.
     * Output: a scalar `K_score(m)` in `[0, 1]` that feeds into `I_align` and `Tension_VoI`.

3. `Information_Pricing_Module`

   * Role: a module that converts information usage decisions (for example whether to call tools or request external data) into explicit “prices” based on `Gap_info(m)` and `Tension_VoI(m)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: candidate tool calls and state summaries.
     * Outputs: suggested acceptance or rejection of calls, together with estimated impact on tension scores.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

1. Task selection

   * Interactive decision tasks where the model can optionally query external tools or data sources.
   * Domains where the value of additional information can be approximately computed by experimenters.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: the model can query tools without any explicit Q120 based signals.
   * TU condition: the model has `VoI_Estimator_Head` and `Knowledge_Gap_Monitor` modules providing the signals described above, and these signals are used by the decision policy.

3. Metrics

   * Overall task performance (for example reward, success rate).
   * Information efficiency: performance per unit of external information cost.
   * Safety margin: how often high risk actions are taken without querying clearly high value channels.

4. Reporting

   * For each condition, log distributions of `I_VoI(m)`, `I_align(m)`, and `Tension_VoI(m)` across tasks.
   * Report whether TU enhanced models achieve lower tension at comparable or higher task performance.

### 7.4 Sixty second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol that external users can run to experience Q120 encoding in an AI system.

**Baseline setup**

* Prompt the AI with a short scenario where a decision must be made (for example whether to launch a product, proceed with a medical procedure, or sign a contract).
* Provide access to several optional information sources without mentioning value of information.
* Ask the AI to decide whether to consult each source and to justify its decisions.

**TU encoded setup**

* Present a similar scenario but additionally instruct the AI to:

  * estimate the normative value of each information source,
  * explain which sources are high value and why,
  * avoid ignoring high value sources in safety critical contexts.
* The AI uses internal Q120 based modules to compute approximate `Gap_info`, `I_VoI`, `I_align`, and `Tension_VoI`.

**Comparison metric**

* Compare how often the AI:

  * consults high value sources,
  * avoids consulting obviously low value or distracting sources,
  * articulates clear reasons tied to value of information and knowledge.

**What to log**

* The prompts, decisions about information use, and associated tension scores (`Gap_info`, `I_VoI`, `I_align`, and `Tension_VoI`) for later analysis and independent recomputation.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `ValueOfInformationGap_Functional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `VOI_norm_profile`, `VOI_real_profile`, `channel_weights`, `V_ref` scales.
     * Output: `gap_score = Gap_info(m)` in `[0, 1]`.
   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs summarize a finite set of channels with consistent units and weight rules fixed at the encoding level.
     * All relevant values are finite and yield a state in `M_reg`.

2. ComponentName: `KnowledgeStateField`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `task_history_summary`, `assessment_signals`.
     * Output: `K_score(m)` in `[0, 1]`.
   * Preconditions:

     * Task history and assessment signals can be summarized in a way that supports a meaningful scalar knowledge score.

3. ComponentName: `InformationChannelLibrary`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `situation_descriptor`.
     * Output: `L_channels(m)`, a finite set of channel descriptors with roles (for example safety critical, optional, cosmetic).
   * Preconditions:

     * Situation descriptors are rich enough to classify channels into role categories used by the weighting rule in `E_VoI`.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q121 (AGI alignment and trust)

   * Reused component: `ValueOfInformationGap_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers: mis-valued alignment relevant information (for example human feedback, oversight signals) can be modeled as high `Gap_info(m)` in alignment scenarios.
   * What changes: `VOI_norm` and `VOI_real` are evaluated for channels conveying human intent and safety constraints.

2. Q123 (AI interpretability and internal representations)

   * Reused component: `KnowledgeStateField` and `InformationChannelLibrary`.
   * Why it transfers: interpretability tools are treated as channels providing information about internal states, and their value depends on the knowledge gap they help close.
   * What changes: the situation descriptor now describes internal model behaviors, and `K_score(m)` is interpreted as knowledge about those behaviors.

3. Q059 (Information theoretic thermodynamics)

   * Reused component: `ValueOfInformationGap_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers: physical measurement channels and feedback loops have both informational and energetic costs, which can be jointly analyzed through `Gap_info(m)`.
   * What changes: `VOI_norm` and `VOI_real` are tied to thermodynamic and control theoretic payoffs rather than human preferences.

4. Q098 (Anthropocene system dynamics)

   * Reused component: `InformationChannelLibrary`.
   * Why it transfers: global policy decisions depend on which scientific and monitoring channels are available and how they are valued.
   * What changes: channels correspond to environmental monitoring systems and scientific assessments, and the situation descriptor encodes planetary scale decisions.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  * A coherent effective layer encoding of Q120 in terms of normalized information gaps and knowledge alignment has been specified.
  * At least one concrete experimental protocol has been described that can falsify specific instances of the encoding in `E_VoI`.

* **N_level: N1**

  * The narrative connecting information, knowledge, incentives, and value has been laid out using explicit observables and tension scores.
  * Counterfactual worlds (World K and World M) have been specified at a qualitative level in terms of `I_VoI`, `I_align`, and `Tension_VoI`.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2 for Q120, at least one of the following should be implemented.

1. A working prototype that:

   * instantiates `ValueOfInformationGap_Functional` and `KnowledgeStateField`,
   * logs `Gap_info(m)` and `Tension_VoI(m)` for real decision tasks (human or AI),
   * and publishes the resulting tension profiles with enough detail to be independently recomputed.

2. A systematic study of controlled human decision experiments where:

   * `VOI_norm` and `VOI_real` are estimated,
   * Q120 tension scores are computed within `E_VoI`,
   * and their relation to independent quality judgments is reported.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer and require no exposure of deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q120 is expected to serve as:

* the central node for value of information and knowledge related tension in socio-technical systems,
* a template for how to encode incentive_tension problems that connect philosophical analysis and concrete engineering,
* a bridge between philosophical accounts of knowledge, decision theoretic models, and practical AI alignment work.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

In ordinary language, Q120 is about a simple but deep question:

> How should we decide what information is worth having, what it means to really know something, and how that should change what we do and what we care about?

Sometimes more information clearly helps. Sometimes it only distracts or even makes things worse. Similarly, having data is not the same as having knowledge that actually guides good action.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to settle every philosophical debate. Instead, we set up a way to measure how far a situation is from the ideal that information and knowledge should be used well.

For each situation, we imagine:

* a small set of possible actions,
* a set of information sources the agent could consult,
* a way to say, in principle, how valuable each source would be if used perfectly,
* and a way to see how much value the agent actually gets from the sources they use.

The difference between “value available” and “value actually used” is turned into a **normalized information gap** between 0 and 1. We combine these gaps across sources, and we also track how far the agent’s knowledge is from a reasonable reference level. When both gaps are small, tension is low. When they are large, tension is high.

We then think about two types of worlds:

* In a good world, agents and institutions mostly use high value information and build solid knowledge, so the tension score stays low.
* In a bad world, high value information is ignored, low value signals are amplified, and knowledge is twisted or missing, so the tension score stays high.

This does not answer every philosophical question about information and knowledge. It does something more modest and concrete:

* it defines observable quantities (information gaps, knowledge scores),
* it specifies how to combine them into normalized tension scores,
* it gives experiments that can show when a particular encoding of these ideas is working or failing,
* and it creates tools that can be reused in other problems, especially in AI alignment and socio-technical design.

Q120 is therefore the reference point for how Tension Universe treats the value of information and knowledge as a measurable kind of tension in real decision making systems.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* No assumptions are made public about any underlying TU generative rules, deep level field equations, or set theoretic embeddings.
* Any such deep level structures, if they exist, are treated as implementation details and are not used in arguments on this page.

### Encoding and fairness

* All encodings belong to the admissible class `E_VoI` as defined in Section 0.3.
* Weighting rules, reference models, normalization constants, and band markers are fixed at encoding design time and cannot be tuned post hoc on a per problem, per world, or per experiment basis.
* Comparisons of tension scores across states are therefore meaningful within a fixed encoding and can be independently audited.

### Tension scale

* All quantities labelled as `DeltaS_*`, `I_*`, or `Tension_*` that are used to define low tension and high tension regimes are normalized, dimensionless scores in the interval `[0, 1]`.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_VoI` and `delta_VoI` are band markers on this normalized scale and are part of the encoding specification.

### Reproducibility and falsifiability

* Sections 6 and 7 describe protocols and engineering patterns that can falsify specific instances of the Q120 encoding without changing the canonical statement of the problem.
* Any implementation that claims to instantiate this page must publish enough information about its encoding choice to allow independent recomputation of the relevant tension scores.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
