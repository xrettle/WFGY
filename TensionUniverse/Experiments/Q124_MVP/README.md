# TU Q124 MVP: Scalable oversight and evaluation

_Status: work in progress. This page records early MVP experiments and may change as the TU Q124 program evolves._

> This page documents the first effective layer MVP experiments for TU Q124
> on scalable oversight and evaluation.
> It does not claim that Q124 is solved as a mathematical problem
> or as a full benchmark.
> The scripts here are small and fully inspectable. You can re run them with your own
> OpenAI API key to reproduce the qualitative patterns, but the exact numbers will drift.

## 0. What this page is about

TU Q124 treats "scalable oversight and evaluation" as a tension problem between three elements:

1. How complex and subtle real tasks become when systems are deployed at scale.  
2. How limited and overloaded the evaluation layer tends to be, whether it is humans or tools.  
3. How easily bad tension can hide inside scores or dashboards that look stable.

This MVP does not try to cover the full Q124 program.

Instead, it focuses on a narrow and fully inspectable slice:

- A finite set of synthetic "worlds" or task clusters where evaluation is non trivial.  
- Two evaluation modes that operate on the same worlds:

  - a baseline evaluator that uses a short, underspecified rubric,  
  - a guided evaluator that receives additional structured context.

- A single scalar tension observable `T_oversight` in the range `[0, 1]`
  that measures how badly the evaluation layer is misaligned with the underlying task signal.

The goal of this MVP is to show that even in very small toy worlds:

- we can encode oversight as a state space with explicit observables,  
- we can define a simple tension functional for the evaluation layer,  
- we can observe systematic differences between evaluation designs,
  using both error rates and tension profiles.

## 1. Experiment A: toy oversight ladders on synthetic tasks

This is the main level 1 MVP for Q124. It is intentionally small and easy to audit.

### 1.1 Research question

In a small set of synthetic oversight worlds:

- Can we define a scalar tension observable `T_oversight` that increases when
  the evaluation layer is clearly out of its depth relative to the underlying task difficulty.  
- When we compare a baseline evaluator and a guided evaluator on the same worlds:

  - Do we see different error rates `B_baseline` and `B_guided`.  
  - Do we see a consistent shift in the tension profiles.  
  - Can simple arbitration rules based on `T_oversight` pick the safer mode more often than chance.

In effective layer language:

> Does a simple tension geometry for oversight let us see, in a reproducible way,
> where naive evaluation is likely to fail, before we look at long term metrics.

### 1.2 Setup

Experiment A uses:

- A finite set of `SCENARIOS` with size between 5 and 12.  
  Each scenario corresponds to a small batch of tasks that must be evaluated.  
  Every scenario carries:

  - a short category label such as `easy_aligned`, `subtle_failure`, `adversarial`,  
  - a free text description used by the evaluators,  
  - reference values such as an effective "difficulty" or OOD measure `delta_ref`,  
  - a ground truth quality scalar `rule_score` in `[0, 1]`.

- Two evaluation modes for every scenario:

  - `baseline` mode:

    - uses a minimal rubric with a few lines of instruction,  
    - sees the scenario description and example outputs.

  - `guided` mode:

    - receives the same inputs as baseline,  
    - plus extra structured checks such as explicit sub questions,  
    - or a step by step evaluation template.

- A judge that turns raw evaluation outputs into:

  - a discrete label `label in {CORRECT, INCORRECT}`,  
  - a confidence or quality score `score in [0, 1]`.

All tasks and rubrics are synthetic and are defined directly in the notebook.
There are no external datasets.

The notebook only uses:

- Python standard library,  
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`,  
- `openai` SDK if a live LLM evaluator is used.

The code is written so that:

- it first looks for an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable,  
- if the key is missing, it will ask the user to paste the key interactively,  
- if no key is provided, it will stop with a clear message and refer back to this README.

### 1.3 Representative results

After one full run of the notebook, we obtain:

- a `DataFrame` where each row is one scenario, with at least the following columns:

  - `scenario_id`  
  - `category`  
  - `delta_ref`  
  - `rule_score`  

  and for each evaluation mode `<mode> in {baseline, guided}`:

  - `<mode>_label`  
  - `<mode>_score`  
  - `<mode>_delta_ground`  
  - `<mode>_delta_outcome`  
  - `<mode>_tension` (this is `T_oversight` for that mode and scenario)  
  - `<mode>_is_correct`  

- a summary dictionary with scalar indicators:

  - `B_baseline` baseline error rate,  
  - `B_guided` guided error rate,  
  - `delta_B = B_baseline - B_guided`,  
  - an aggregate tension contrast `rho_tension` that summarizes how far apart
    the two tension profiles are.

The target qualitative pattern for a successful MVP is:

- `B_guided` is not worse than `B_baseline` on this toy set,  
- the guided mode tends to reduce tension on the highest tension scenarios,  
- the arbitration rule that picks the mode with lower `T_oversight`
  matches or beats the better of the two modes on most scenarios.

Once we have a stable run, we will paste the concrete numbers here as a short table,
so that readers can see at a glance what the toy experiment actually does
without opening the notebook.

For now this section documents the intended structure and observables.

### 1.4 How to reproduce

1. Open the notebook

   - `TensionUniverse/Experiments/Q124_MVP/Q124_A.ipynb`

2. Provide an OpenAI API key

   - If you already have `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment, the notebook will use it.  
   - Otherwise, the first code cell will prompt you to paste an API key once.  
   - If you do not want to call a live model, you can still read this README
     and inspect the tension geometry design, but the experiment will not run.

3. Install dependencies if needed

   - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `openai`  

   The notebook includes a single `pip` cell that you can run in a clean Colab runtime.

4. Run all cells from top to bottom

   - the script will define the `SCENARIOS`,  
   - run both `baseline` and `guided` evaluators,  
   - compute per scenario metrics and tension scores,  
   - assemble the `DataFrame`,  
   - print a compact summary block,  
   - and draw a simple tension plot.

5. Inspect the outputs

   - The final cell calls:

     ```python
     results_df, results_summary = run_experiment()
     plot_tension(results_df)
     ```

   - You can scroll to inspect the printed table,  
   - and you can visually compare the two tension curves on the plot.

## 2. Experiment B: reserved for future extensions

This section is intentionally left light for the first pass.

Once Experiment A is stable, Experiment B can host a slightly more advanced variant, for example:

- increasing the number or diversity of scenarios,  
- adding a third evaluation mode such as "stacked tools" or "committee oversight",  
- or testing a different definition of `T_oversight` that emphasizes different observables.

The structure for Experiment B will mirror the A block
but may be shorter and focus on a specific extension.

## 3. How this MVP fits into the Tension Universe

At the Tension Universe level, Q124 connects several clusters:

- AI alignment and control questions (see Q121 and Q122),  
- interpretability and internal representation questions (Q123),  
- data quality and truth extraction from synthetic worlds (Q127),  
- and social oversight structures that come from complex systems and governance.

This MVP does not try to answer any of the large questions directly.

Instead, it gives a concrete example of:

- how to encode oversight as a finite state space of worlds and modes,  
- how to define a scalar tension functional for an evaluation layer,  
- how to compare different oversight designs by looking at both error rates
  and tension profiles.

The same pattern can be reused across other S class problems in this pack:

- in some problems, the "worlds" are scientific projects or long horizon policies,  
- in others, they are synthetic AI tasks or games,  
- but in all cases the oversight layer is treated as a system
  with its own tension geometry, not as a black box.

For a full understanding of Q124 inside the global Tension Universe,
this page should be read together with the core TU charters
and with the main Event Horizon overview.

### Charters and formal context

This MVP should be read together with the core Tension Universe charters.

- [TU Effective Layer Charter](../../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)  
- [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)  
- [TU Tension Scale Charter](../../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

These charters define how effective layer claims, encodings and tension scales are supposed
to behave across the whole project. The experiments on this page are written to stay inside
those boundaries.
