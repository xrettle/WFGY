## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework:

* We only specify state spaces, observables, mismatch fields, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds at a coarse semantic level.
* We do not introduce any new axiom system, bottom layer generating rules, or constructive procedures for TU itself.
* We do not provide any explicit mapping from raw biological data or microphysical states to internal TU fields. We only assume that TU compatible world models exist that can realize the patterns described here.
* We do not claim to solve the canonical scientific problem of aging, nor to identify a unique microscopic mechanism. All claims are about the structure and behavior of an effective encoding of aging related tension.
* All experiments and falsification criteria in this document apply to concrete encoding instances
  `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)` as defined in Section 3.6. Rejecting such an instance does not falsify TU as a whole, nor any canonical biological theory of aging.
* All fairness and stability conditions are to be interpreted at the level of encoding design. They constrain how `Tension_age` and related quantities may be used, not the underlying biology itself.

Readers should treat this page as an effective layer specification of how TU represents aging tension, not as a claim about the ultimate microscopic truth of why organisms age.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q075 can be phrased as:

> Describe, at a mechanistic and predictive level, how multicellular organisms age, by identifying the core processes that:
>
> 1. generate damage and loss of function,
> 2. repair or compensate for this damage, and
> 3. shape the resulting patterns of survival, health span, and late life tail risks.

More concretely, we seek an effective description in which:

1. Aging is represented as a dynamical process on a set of biological subsystems (molecular, cellular, tissue, systemic).

2. Each subsystem experiences:

   * accumulation of structural and informational damage,
   * limited repair and maintenance capacity,
   * changes in functional reserve and resilience.

3. Macroscopic outcomes such as:

   * increasing incidence of disease,
   * loss of functional capacity,
   * rising mortality hazard and tail risks,

   emerge from these microscopic and mesoscopic dynamics.

The central question is not simply “why do organisms age”, but:

> Under what structural and resource constraints is progressive aging, in the sense of growing failure risk and functional decline, an unavoidable high tension attractor, and under what conditions can it be postponed, compensated, or qualitatively altered.

Q075 does not attempt to prove that a specific molecular model is uniquely correct. Instead it focuses on:

* identifying a small set of core mechanisms that must appear in any coherent, predictive theory of aging for complex organisms,
* organizing these mechanisms into a structured tension model that can be tested, falsified, and reused across domains.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Aging research has produced many identified “hallmarks” or “pillars” of aging, such as:

* genomic instability and telomere attrition,
* epigenetic alterations,
* loss of proteostasis,
* deregulated nutrient sensing,
* mitochondrial dysfunction,
* cellular senescence,
* stem cell exhaustion,
* altered intercellular communication and chronic inflammation.

These hallmarks capture important pieces of the puzzle, but they do not yet form:

* a single agreed upon, predictive dynamical model that explains why certain trade offs and patterns of aging recur across species,
* a unified account of why mortality curves and late life tail risks take the shapes observed in populations,
* a stable mapping between interventions and long term changes in health span and lifespan.

Existing models of damage accumulation, reliability theory, and network robustness capture parts of aging dynamics, but:

* they often treat subsystems in isolation,
* they do not always integrate resource constraints, repair costs, and evolutionary trade offs,
* they can fit data but are not always structurally falsifiable in a clear way.

Thus, the “fundamental mechanisms of aging” remain only partially unified. Q075 assumes that:

* there is no single molecular switch for aging,
* but there should exist a compact effective description that captures how damage, repair, reserve, and tail risks interact to generate aging trajectories in a wide class of organisms and engineered analogues.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection:

1. Q075 is the central node for aging and senescence:

   * It defines the aging tension functional that later problems reuse for regeneration, life extension, and population level risk control.

2. Q075 bridges biological and socio technical problems:

   * The same patterns of slow drift, maintenance cost, and tail risk appear in engineered systems, organizations, and AI infrastructures.
   * Q075 provides the template for “aging” as a generic phenomenon: progressive imbalance between load, repair, and reserve under constraints.

3. Q075 is the biological counterpart of thermodynamic and information theoretic problems:

   * It imports tools from non equilibrium thermodynamics, risk theory, and reliability, recast as risk_tail_tension on a hybrid state space.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q075 sits inside the BlackHole graph for Q001–Q125, using only Q identifiers and one line reasons that point to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide foundations or tools for Q075.

* Q071 (Origin of life and prebiotic chemistry)
  Reason: supplies the notion of self maintaining chemical systems whose long term stability and failure define where “aging” becomes meaningful.

* Q072 (Origin and structure of the genetic code)
  Reason: constrains how information is stored and passed across generations, influencing mutation patterns and repair logic that feed into damage dynamics.

* Q073 (Major evolutionary transitions in individuality)
  Reason: explains how multicellular individuality creates organism level “carriers” whose aging must be analyzed beyond pure cell level turnover.

* Q074 (Robustness of cell differentiation)
  Reason: provides field level descriptors of differentiation robustness and plasticity, which Q075 treats as resources that age can degrade.

* Q078 (Genotype to phenotype mapping)
  Reason: delivers the general mapping schema in which aging is a long horizon drift of phenotype distributions under fixed or slowly changing genotypes.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q075 components or depend on its aging tension structure.

* Q076 (Principles of regeneration and repair)
  Reason: reuses the `DamageRepairBalanceIndex` and `AgingTrajectoryDescriptor` to compare aging erosion with regenerative recovery and partial reset.

* Q079 (Life extension and human enhancement)
  Reason: depends on the `LongevityTailRiskFunctional` to formalize trade offs between extended lifespan, health span, and new tail risks.

* Q080 (Population longevity and tail risk control)
  Reason: uses Q075’s risk_tail_tension encoding as the base for population level survivorship and systemic tail risk policies.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension structure but no direct component dependence.

* Q059 (Information thermodynamics in computation and biology)
  Reason: both treat long horizon maintenance, entropy production, and failure under resource constraints, expressed via risk_tail_tension on hybrid fields.

* Q071 (Origin of life and prebiotic chemistry)
  Reason: both study stability and breakdown of self maintaining systems under noise, but at different organizational scales and time horizons.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q075 to other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (Quantum thermodynamic constraints on information processing)
  Reason: reuses thermodynamic constraint patterns to bound maximum sustainable repair rates and anti aging intervention costs.

* Q039 (Quantum turbulence and complex flow patterns)
  Reason: uses analogies between aging trajectories and flows that gradually lose coherence and develop intermittent high risk events.

* Q123 (AI interpretability and representation phase transitions)
  Reason: reuses Q075’s notion of long running systems that gradually accumulate representational “damage” and lose functional reserve.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* mismatch quantities and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden TU core axiom system, generative rules, or explicit mappings from raw biological data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a hybrid semantic state space

`M`

with the following properties at the effective layer:

1. Each state `m` in `M` represents a coarse snapshot of a living system or engineered analog, including:

   * distributions of cell or module states across tissues or components,
   * summary measures of molecular and structural damage in key subsystems,
   * effective repair and maintenance capacities,
   * functional reserves for important functions,
   * a current hazard profile for survival or system level failure.

2. At this level we do not distinguish between “real biological organism” and “engineered system with aging like dynamics”. We only require:

   * the existence of consistent summaries,
   * the possibility to order states along a time like parameter such as chronological age, cycles, or usage.

We do not specify:

* how these summaries are computed from raw data,
* how fine grained the underlying physical system is,
* how the TU core constructs `M`.

We only assume that for each system and time window of interest, there exist states in `M` that encode the relevant summaries in a way that can be applied consistently.

### 3.2 Core observables

On `M` we define the following observables.

1. Damage load

```txt
Damage_load(m; s) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m` and subsystem label `s` (for example DNA, proteome, mitochondria, extracellular matrix, vascular network).
* Output: a nonnegative scalar summarizing accumulated damage or irreversible modifications in subsystem `s`.

2. Repair capacity

```txt
Repair_capacity(m; s) >= 0
```

* Input: `m` and subsystem `s`.
* Output: an effective nonnegative scalar summarizing the system’s capacity to detect, repair, or compensate damage in `s` per unit of time or per unit of load.

3. Functional reserve

```txt
Functional_reserve(m; s)
```

* Input: `m` and subsystem or function label `s` (for example cardiac output, immune response, cognitive tasks).
* Output: a scalar that indicates how far current performance is from failure or unacceptable impairment for function `s`. Higher values indicate larger reserve.

4. Chronic noise and inflammation index

```txt
Inflammation_noise(m) >= 0
```

* Input: `m`.
* Output: scalar index of chronic inflammatory activity, mis regulated signaling, or noise like disturbances that impact many subsystems.

5. Mortality hazard

```txt
Mortality_hazard(m) >= 0
```

* Input: `m`.
* Output: an effective scalar hazard rate for total system failure or death at the current state.

These observables can be instantiated differently for different systems. The effective layer only requires that:

* they are defined and finite for states in the regular domain,
* they can be compared across states of the same system,
* they respect the hybrid semantic type declared in the metadata.

### 3.3 Mismatch fields

We define mismatch quantities that compare observables to reference bands associated with low aging tension.

1. Damage mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_damage(m) >= 0
```

* Measures how far `Damage_load(m; s)` across key subsystems deviates from a youthful or low age tension reference band.
* `DeltaS_damage(m) = 0` if damage loads for all tracked subsystems lie inside a specified low tension band.

2. Repair mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_repair(m) >= 0
```

* Measures how far `Repair_capacity(m; s)` falls below the level required to keep damage in safe bands under typical loads.
* `DeltaS_repair(m) = 0` if repair capacity is adequate for all tracked subsystems.

3. Reserve mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_reserve(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the shortfall of `Functional_reserve(m; s)` relative to a desired reserve band that keeps systems far from functional failure.
* `DeltaS_reserve(m) = 0` if functional reserves are within or above target bands.

4. Risk tail mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_risk_tail(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the extent to which `Mortality_hazard(m)` and related risk measures place excessive probability mass in high hazard or catastrophic regimes, relative to youthful or desired reference curves.
* `DeltaS_risk_tail(m) = 0` if hazards and tail probabilities lie within safe reference bands.

Each mismatch is defined with respect to a reference class of low tension trajectories. We only require that:

* the reference bands are defined independently of the specific state `m` being evaluated,
* they are fixed once for a given study or encoding and not tuned afterwards to fit outcomes.

The observable `Inflammation_noise(m)` is treated as an input that can influence `DeltaS_damage(m)` and `DeltaS_risk_tail(m)` inside a concrete encoding instance `E*`. In the base specification for Q075 it does not introduce a separate top level mismatch term, but encodings are allowed to document how chronic inflammation contributes to damage and tail risk bands.

### 3.4 Combined aging mismatch and tension tensor

We define a combined aging mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_age(m) = w_damage * DeltaS_damage(m)
              + w_repair * DeltaS_repair(m)
              + w_reserve * DeltaS_reserve(m)
              + w_tail   * DeltaS_risk_tail(m)
```

with weights satisfying:

```txt
w_damage > 0
w_repair > 0
w_reserve > 0
w_tail   > 0
w_damage + w_repair + w_reserve + w_tail = 1
```

These weights are part of the encoding design and must be:

* chosen before running experiments for a given application,
* justified based on domain knowledge or explicit modeling goals,
* kept fixed across the comparison of different states or interventions within the same encoding instance.

We then embed `DeltaS_age(m)` into an effective tension tensor:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_age(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor indicating the strength of the i-th driver of aging related stress in state `m` (for example metabolic load, environmental stress, lifestyle load),
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor indicating how sensitive the j-th downstream function or subsystem is to aging related stress,
* `lambda(m)` is the TU convergence state factor (for example indicating convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic local dynamics),
* `kappa` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of aging related tension in this encoding.

We do not specify the detailed form or origin of `S_i`, `C_j`, `lambda`, or `kappa`. It is sufficient that:

* for each `m` in the regular domain, `T_ij(m)` is well defined and finite for the indices considered,
* `DeltaS_age(m)` enters as a multiplicative factor, so that high mismatch translates into high tension in any sensitive direction.

In the header metadata this structure is summarized as a `risk_tail_tension` instance, emphasizing that late life hazard tails are treated as a primary target of the encoding.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables can become undefined or unbounded, for example:

* missing or inconsistent measurements,
* extreme pathological states where usual summaries break down,
* states where hazard is not meaningfully defined (for example non living systems accidentally encoded).

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           any of Damage_load, Repair_capacity, Functional_reserve,
           Inflammation_noise, Mortality_hazard, or the combined
           DeltaS_age(m) is undefined, inconsistent, or not finite }
```

We restrict aging tension analysis to the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

Any attempt to interpret `DeltaS_age(m)` for `m` in `S_sing` is treated as “out of domain” and not as evidence about aging mechanisms. Experiments and protocols in later blocks explicitly state that they operate only on `M_reg`.

### 3.6 Encoding class and fairness constraints

To separate TU structure from particular implementations, we define an encoding class for Q075:

```txt
E = (D, F, W, L)
```

where:

* `D` is a data to state mapping that turns raw measurements (for example biomarkers, functional tests, survival data, model outputs) into states `m` in `M_reg` along an age, cycle, or usage axis.

* `F` is a family of functionals that map observables to mismatch quantities and tension scores: `DeltaS_damage`, `DeltaS_repair`, `DeltaS_reserve`, `DeltaS_risk_tail`, and `DeltaS_age`, together with any auxiliary quantities needed to evaluate them.

* `W` is the collection of weights, bands, and thresholds used by the encoding, including:

  * the weights `w_damage`, `w_repair`, `w_reserve`, `w_tail`,
  * lower and upper bounds for safe damage, repair, and reserve bands,
  * reference hazard and tail risk bands that define low tension aging.

* `L` specifies the allowed system and data types for which the encoding is declared valid, such as:

  * specific species or model organisms,
  * classes of engineered systems,
  * particular cohorts or datasets.

A concrete encoding instance is written as:

```txt
E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
```

In any experiment or analysis in this document, the following fairness constraints apply:

* For a fixed study, `E*` must be chosen and documented before inspecting the comparative results that will be used for falsification.

* Within a given application of Q075, the same `E*` must be used across all groups, species, or interventions that are being compared. It is not permitted to adjust weights or reference bands separately for different arms in order to improve apparent performance.

* Refinements of an encoding, such as adding more biomarkers or slightly increasing resolution, must either:

  * be justified as part of a controlled refinement of `E*`, or
  * be recorded as a new encoding instance `E'` that is then evaluated separately.

* Cross species or cross system comparisons are only meaningful when all systems lie inside the same `L*` domain, or when explicit mapping rules between domains are specified as part of `D*` and `F*`.

Throughout Sections 4–8 we assume that all states `m` and all tension values are computed under a fixed admissible encoding instance `E*` unless stated otherwise.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q075 is expressed as a tension problem within TU, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core aging tension functional

We reuse the combined mismatch `DeltaS_age(m)` and interpret it as the central aging tension score:

```txt
Tension_age(m) = DeltaS_age(m)
```

with the properties:

* `Tension_age(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`,
* `Tension_age(m) = 0` only in idealized low tension states,
* `Tension_age(m)` increases when damage accumulates, repair capacity fails to keep up, reserve shrinks, or tail risks grow.

This is a normalized scalar that summarizes how far a state is from a chosen low tension aging reference band. In the header metadata this is recorded as a `risk_tail_tension` instance, since changes in late life tail risks are treated as a primary aging signature.

### 4.2 Low tension aging principle

A low tension aging principle states that:

> For systems in which aging is negligible over a long region of their lifespan, there exist world representing states `m_young` in `M_reg` such that
>
> `Tension_age(m_young) <= epsilon_age`
>
> for some small `epsilon_age` that remains bounded and stable as encodings are refined and better data are added.

In practice this means:

* damage loads remain within bands that repair can handle,
* repair capacities stay above critical thresholds,
* functional reserves remain high,
* tail risks do not dominate survival or function.

This principle does not assert that `epsilon_age` tends to zero. It only requires:

* the existence of a stable low tension plateau,
* the ability to identify states on that plateau for a range of systems or individuals.

### 4.3 High tension aging principle

A high tension aging principle states that:

> For systems exhibiting conventional aging, there exist world representing states `m_old` in `M_reg` such that
>
> `Tension_age(m_old) >= delta_age`
>
> for some strictly positive `delta_age` that cannot be reduced below that level without structural changes to architecture, resource allocation, or other deep constraints.

Concretely, as the system proceeds along chronological age, usage, or cycles:

* damage loads increase and are not fully compensated,
* repair capacity declines or saturates,
* functional reserves shrink toward critical values,
* mortality hazard develops non negligible tail mass at high risk levels.

The fundamental mechanisms of aging, in this framing, are the structural reasons why:

* `Tension_age` tends to be low early in life,
* then increases and remains above some baseline as systems age,
* and why attempts to alter this trajectory face trade offs and constraints.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe counterfactual worlds using only effective layer observables and tensions. No generative rules or deep TU constructions are specified.

### 5.1 World T: negligible senescence world

World T represents systems where aging is extremely slow or negligible over a long period.

Characteristics:

1. Damage and repair balance

   * For world representing states `m_T(age)` across a long age interval, `DeltaS_damage(m_T)` remains small and is matched by `DeltaS_repair(m_T)` staying near zero.
   * Repair capacity does not drift far below the levels needed to keep damage in safe bands.

2. Functional reserve

   * `DeltaS_reserve(m_T)` remains small, indicating that functional reserves stay comfortably above critical thresholds.

3. Tail risks

   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_T)` is low and does not grow sharply with age in the early and mid segments of the lifespan.
   * Mortality hazard curves are flat or only slowly increasing for a long interval.

4. Global tension

   * The combined tension satisfies

     ```txt
     Tension_age(m_T(age)) <= epsilon_age
     ```

     for ages within the negligible senescence zone, with `epsilon_age` small and not growing with simple refinements of data.

### 5.2 World F: conventional aging world

World F represents systems with familiar human like or mammalian aging.

Characteristics:

1. Damage and repair imbalance

   * `DeltaS_damage(m_F(age))` grows with age as damage accumulates in multiple subsystems.
   * `DeltaS_repair(m_F(age))` grows because repair capacity declines, becomes mis regulated, or cannot keep up with accumulated damage.

2. Functional reserve erosion

   * `DeltaS_reserve(m_F(age))` increases as reserves for critical functions (for example cardiac, cognitive, immune) shrink.
   * There is a progressive approach to thresholds beyond which small perturbations cause failures.

3. Tail risk amplification

   * `DeltaS_risk_tail(m_F(age))` rises, indicating growing mass of hazard in high risk regimes.
   * Mortality hazard curves steepen in late life, producing a heavy tail of catastrophic events.

4. Global tension

   * For some age range, we have

     ```txt
     Tension_age(m_F(age)) >= delta_age
     ```

     with `delta_age > 0` that cannot be eliminated without altering architecture or constraints, not just surface level parameters.

### 5.3 Optional worlds: premature and delayed aging

We also define two optional counterfactual worlds.

World P: premature aging

* Similar mechanisms as World F, but:

  * high `DeltaS_damage` and `DeltaS_repair` appear at much earlier ages or cycles,
  * `DeltaS_reserve` erodes quickly,
  * `DeltaS_risk_tail` rises early, producing compressed and shifted aging trajectories.

World L: extended healthy longevity

* For an extended age interval, states `m_L(age)` behave more like World T:

  * delayed rise of `DeltaS_damage` and `DeltaS_repair`,
  * functional reserve maintained longer,
  * delayed growth of `DeltaS_risk_tail`.

* At very high ages, trajectories may still resemble World F due to deeper constraints.

These counterfactuals allow Q075 to structure comparative questions:

* Which interventions move systems from F toward L?
* Which disorders push systems from F toward P?

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that test the coherence and usefulness of the Q075 encoding. They do not prove or disprove any ultimate theory of aging. They only:

* validate or falsify specific aging tension encodings,
* check whether `Tension_age` behaves in a stable and interpretable way.

In each experiment we assume a fixed admissible encoding instance:

```txt
E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
```

as defined in Section 3.6. All states `m` and all tension scores are computed under this fixed instance, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Experiment 1: Longitudinal aging tension profiling in a cohort

**Goal**

Test whether `Tension_age(m)` tracks health span and survival in a longitudinal cohort and whether the encoding is stable under reasonable refinements.

**Setup**

* Take a human or animal cohort with repeated measures over time that fall inside the domain `L*` of the chosen encoding instance `E*`.

* For each time point, compute derived summaries for:

  * damage related biomarkers in key subsystems,
  * proxies for repair capacity (for example DNA repair indicators, proteostasis markers),
  * functional reserves (for example grip strength, cognitive scores, organ function tests),
  * current mortality hazard estimates or risk scores.

* Use `D*` to map these summaries into states `m(t)` in `M_reg`.

**Protocol**

1. For each individual and time point, build `m(t)` using the fixed data mapping `D*`.
2. Use `F*` and `W*` to compute `DeltaS_damage(m(t))`, `DeltaS_repair(m(t))`, `DeltaS_reserve(m(t))`, `DeltaS_risk_tail(m(t))`, and `Tension_age(m(t))`.
3. Track trajectories of `Tension_age` over time for each individual.
4. Compare `Tension_age` trajectories against:

   * observed onset of age related diseases,
   * functional decline events,
   * survival or major adverse events.

**Metrics**

* Correlation between `Tension_age` levels and risk of near term events.
* Separation of high and low risk groups based on `Tension_age` at given ages.
* Stability of results under reasonable refinements of `E*` that keep its structure but slightly increase resolution, such as adding more biomarkers.

**Falsification conditions**

* If `Tension_age` fails to correlate with health span and survival in a robust way across multiple cohorts and encoding refinements that stay within the same encoding class, then the particular instance `E*` is rejected at the effective layer.
* If small, justified changes in `D*` or `F*` completely invert which trajectories are high or low tension without corresponding biological justification, `E*` is considered unstable and is rejected or must be replaced by a differently documented instance.

**Semantics implementation note**

The state space is treated as hybrid: continuous fields for biomarker levels and functional reserves, with discrete indicators for events (for example disease onset, step changes in treatment). The encoding must map these into a coherent hybrid structure consistent with the semantic type declared in the header metadata.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a specific `E*` for Q075 does not solve the canonical statement about aging and does not falsify TU as a whole. It only shows that this instance is not an adequate effective encoding of aging tension for the systems and data considered.

---

### Experiment 2: Intervention response and tension shift

**Goal**

Test whether interventions known to extend health span or lifespan produce consistent and interpretable shifts in `Tension_age` under a fixed encoding instance `E*`.

**Setup**

* Select interventions with evidence of health span or lifespan extension in model organisms or human observational data (for example caloric restriction in animals, certain drugs in trials) that are compatible with the domain `L*`.
* For each intervention and control group, obtain pre and post intervention measures similar to those in Experiment 1.

**Protocol**

1. Use the same `D*` as in Experiment 1 to build states `m_pre` and `m_post` for individuals or groups.
2. Use `F*` and `W*` to compute `Tension_age(m_pre)` and `Tension_age(m_post)` for all subjects.
3. Compare distributions of `Tension_age` changes between intervention and control groups.
4. Stratify by baseline `Tension_age` to see if high tension individuals respond differently from low tension ones.

**Metrics**

* Average change in `Tension_age` for intervention versus control.
* Fraction of individuals with tension reduction above a meaningful threshold.
* Consistency of tension shifts with observed changes in health span markers.

**Falsification conditions**

* If interventions consistently shown to extend health span or lifespan fail to produce any reduction in `Tension_age` under reasonable parameters of `E*`, the encoding instance is misaligned with aging phenomenology and must be revised or replaced.
* If harmful or clearly pro aging exposures are assigned large reductions in `Tension_age` by `F*` and `W*`, the encoding is strongly misaligned and is rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**

The hybrid nature of states is preserved: continuous changes in metrics and discrete intervention events are encoded in a way that does not alter the structural meaning of `DeltaS_age`. The same semantic conventions as in the header metadata must be respected.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding instance `E*` in this sense does not solve the canonical statement. Success or failure in mapping interventions to tension shifts only evaluates the chosen encoding, not the full truth about aging mechanisms.

---

### Experiment 3: Cross species and model organism comparison

**Goal**

Check whether a common Q075 encoding instance `E*` can distinguish between species and strains with different lifespans and aging patterns.

**Setup**

* Select several species with different lifespans (for example short lived rodents, longer lived mammals) and strains with altered aging (for example long lived mutants, progeroid models).
* Obtain comparable summaries of damage, repair, reserve, and hazard for each species and strain that lie inside the domain `L*` of `E*`.

**Protocol**

1. Define a common data mapping `D*` that maps measures from each species into states `m_species(age)` in `M_reg`. Any species specific adjustments must be documented as part of `D*` rather than as implicit changes to `F*` or `W*`.
2. Use `F*` and `W*` to compute `Tension_age(m_species(age))` across the lifespan for each species and strain.
3. Compare trajectory shapes:

   * levels and slopes of `Tension_age`,
   * onset of high tension regimes.

**Metrics**

* Degree to which known long lived species or strains exhibit delayed or reduced `Tension_age` compared to short lived ones.
* Alignment of `Tension_age` patterns with observed survival and health span data.

**Falsification conditions**

* If known long lived species or strains consistently show higher `Tension_age` than short lived controls across age ranges, under reasonable choices of `E*` that respect fairness constraints, the current encoding instance is rejected as a candidate for cross species universality.
* If encoding must be tuned separately for each species by changing `W*` in ways that destroy cross species comparability, Q075’s claim of a shared aging tension structure for that `E*` is weakened and may be rejected for that application.

**Semantics implementation note**

The hybrid structure is used to accommodate species specific discrete events (for example reproductive transition) while keeping continuous trends for damage, repair, and reserve. The semantics remain hybrid as declared in the header metadata.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a particular cross species encoding instance of Q075 tests the universality of that aging tension encoding. It does not settle the canonical aging problem or the broader TU framework.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q075 can be used as an engineering module in AI systems under WFGY, at the effective layer. All references to tension values and mismatches assume a fixed encoding instance `E*` when evaluated on concrete data.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals derived from Q075 observables.

1. `signal_damage_repair_balance`

   * Definition: proportional to `DeltaS_damage(m) + DeltaS_repair(m)` in contexts where aging and maintenance trade offs are discussed.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states that imply worsening damage with insufficient repair without acknowledging increased risk or reduced resilience.

2. `signal_reserve_vs_risk`

   * Definition: proportional to `DeltaS_reserve(m) + DeltaS_risk_tail(m)` when models claim high functional reserve but also high tail risks, or when claims of low risk are paired with obviously thin reserves.
   * Purpose: encourage consistency between statements about resilience and implied risk of failure.

3. `signal_lifespan_trajectory_consistency`

   * Definition: measures inconsistency between an implied lifespan or health span trajectory and the sequence of `Tension_age` scores along that trajectory.
   * Purpose: discourage narratives where claimed outcomes do not match the implied evolution of aging tension.

4. `signal_intervention_realism`

   * Definition: evaluates whether proposed interventions produce plausible changes in `DeltaS_damage`, `DeltaS_repair`, `DeltaS_reserve`, and `DeltaS_risk_tail` under a fixed `E*`.
   * Purpose: downweight speculative answers that promise large lifespan increases without corresponding tension shifts.

All training signals must be derived from the same encoding instance `E*` when used inside a given model or evaluation run. Mixing signals from different encodings without explicit bridging rules is not permitted.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q075 components.

1. `AgingTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a biological or engineered system, output estimates of `DeltaS_damage`, `DeltaS_repair`, `DeltaS_reserve`, `DeltaS_risk_tail`, and `Tension_age`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embeddings summarizing system state and context.
     * Output: a small vector of mismatch scores and a combined `Tension_age` scalar.

2. `LongevityScenarioSimulator`

   * Role: given baseline states and intervention descriptions, generate counterfactual trajectories in tension space (for example approximate paths from World F toward World L).
   * Interface:

     * Input: baseline embedding, intervention description, time horizon.
     * Output: sequence of estimated `Tension_age` values and key component summaries over the horizon.

3. `MaintenancePolicyAdvisor`

   * Role: map desired constraints on tail risk and health span into recommendations based on tension shifts, without emitting hidden TU rules.
   * Interface:

     * Input: desired constraints, context about system and resources.
     * Output: ranked classes of interventions and maintenance strategies, with associated qualitative or quantitative tension implications.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness to test AI models augmented with Q075 modules.

1. Task set

   * Questions about:

     * mechanisms of aging,
     * evaluation of proposed anti aging interventions,
     * trade offs between repair, performance, and risk,
     * interpretation of cohort survival curves and biomarkers.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * model answers questions without explicit use of Q075 modules.

   * TU condition:

     * model uses `AgingTensionHead` and related signals as auxiliary guidance, with a fixed encoding instance `E*`.

3. Metrics

   * Factual accuracy on established mechanisms and data.

   * Internal consistency:

     * across age ranges,
     * across different interventions,
     * between predicted biomarkers and predicted outcomes.

   * Ability to avoid “miracle cure” narratives that have unrealistic tension profiles under `E*`.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple protocol to expose Q075’s impact to users.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt the AI: “Explain why complex organisms age, what trade offs are involved, and how realistic life extension might work.”
  * Observe whether the answer mixes mechanisms, over promises interventions, or ignores tail risks.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt the AI with the same question but add:

    * “Organize your explanation using an aging tension perspective based on damage, repair, functional reserve, and tail risks. Assume a fixed internal aging tension encoding.”

  * Optionally allow the AI to output a qualitative `Tension_age` trajectory.

* Comparison metric:

  * Human evaluators rate:

    * clarity of mechanisms,
    * explicitness of trade offs,
    * realism of claims,
    * consistency of the internal story.

* What to log:

  * prompts and responses,
  * any `Tension_age` and component scores produced by Q075 related modules for the fixed `E*`,
  * enabling later inspection without revealing TU core rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q075 and how they transfer to other BlackHole problems. All transfers are at the effective layer and do not introduce additional TU bottom layer assumptions.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `DamageRepairBalanceIndex`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: aggregated `Damage_load` and `Repair_capacity` summaries across subsystems.
     * Output: scalar index indicating whether repair can keep up with damage within chosen bands.

   * Preconditions:

     * damage and repair summaries must be computed consistently for the system and state class being compared.

2. ComponentName: `LongevityTailRiskFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: multi point `Mortality_hazard` estimates and related risk measures over time.
     * Output: scalar or low dimensional vector capturing heaviness and shape of late life tail risks.

   * Preconditions:

     * hazard profiles must be estimated over comparable time scales and contexts.

3. ComponentName: `AgingTrajectoryDescriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: ordered sequence of states `m(age)` or `m(cycle)`.
     * Output: compressed description of `Tension_age` evolution (for example early low plateau, mid life rise, late life saturation).

   * Preconditions:

     * states must be ordered along a meaningful age, cycle, or usage axis.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q076 (Principles of regeneration and repair)

   * Reused components: `DamageRepairBalanceIndex`, `AgingTrajectoryDescriptor`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * Q076 compares regenerative episodes with chronic aging trajectories. Both need a clear measure of how repair balances damage and how trajectories change.

   * What changes:

     * input states emphasize acute repair episodes and local tissue level regeneration rather than whole organism aging.

2. Q079 (Life extension and human enhancement)

   * Reused components: `LongevityTailRiskFunctional`, `AgingTrajectoryDescriptor`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * Q079 studies interventions that alter lifespan and health span, so it needs explicit descriptors of how tail risks and tension trajectories respond.

   * What changes:

     * interventions are more speculative, and the focus shifts to scenario comparison under constraints and trade offs.

3. Q080 (Population longevity and tail risk control)

   * Reused components: `LongevityTailRiskFunctional`, `DamageRepairBalanceIndex`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * Q080 lifts Q075’s concepts to population and policy scales, where tail risk management and average repair resources become central.

   * What changes:

     * hazard and damage repair summaries become population level statistics rather than individual level quantities.

All reuse is constrained to the effective layer and must reference a documented encoding instance when numerical values of tension or indices are involved.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block situates Q075 along the TU verification ladder and defines next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding for aging mechanisms is specified:

    * state space `M` and regular domain `M_reg`,
    * observables for damage, repair, reserve, noise, and hazard,
    * mismatch fields and combined `Tension_age`,
    * singular set and domain restrictions,
    * an explicit encoding class `E = (D, F, W, L)` and the notion of fixed instances `E*`,
    * at least one detailed experiment with falsification conditions for such instances.

* N_level: N1

  * A narrative is provided that:

    * links molecular, cellular, and systemic processes to tension patterns,
    * distinguishes low and high tension worlds,
    * avoids claims of unique microscopic truth.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move Q075 from E1 to E2, we require concrete implementations:

1. Prototype tension calculator

   * Implement a tool that:

     * ingests real or synthetic aging datasets that fall inside a chosen `L*`,
     * constructs states `m_data` under a fixed encoding instance `E*`,
     * computes `Tension_age(m_data)` and component mismatches,
     * publishes resulting tension trajectories and basic analyses.

2. Application to at least two distinct contexts

   * Apply the same encoding instance to:

     * a human or large animal cohort,
     * a short lived model organism with intervention data.

   * Demonstrate that:

     * long lived or treated groups show delayed or reduced `Tension_age` relative to appropriate controls,
     * results are stable under reasonable refinements of `E*` that do not change its structural class.

Both steps operate solely on observable summaries and do not expose any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q075 is expected to serve as:

* The canonical aging node that organizes how TU treats slow drift, maintenance costs, and tail risks across biology, engineering, and AI systems.
* A template for modeling “aging like” phenomena in non biological systems, using the same tension framework.
* A bridge that connects problem classes:

  * biological aging,
  * reliability engineering,
  * socio technical system decay,
  * long running AI system degradation.

Q075 does not claim that a single microscopic mechanism controls all aging. Instead it claims that:

* any coherent, testable theory of aging for complex systems must fit into a structure where `Tension_age` and its components behave like those defined here,
* this structure can be probed and falsified without exposing TU core axioms.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non technical explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer.

Aging in complex organisms looks complicated. Many things go wrong at once:

* DNA accumulates mutations,
* proteins misfold and aggregate,
* cells stop dividing or behave abnormally,
* tissues lose structure,
* the immune system gets noisy and confused,
* the risk of sudden serious failures goes up.

Instead of trying to pick one cause, Q075 organizes aging into four pieces:

1. Damage load: how much long lasting damage has built up in important parts of the system.
2. Repair capacity: how strong the system’s ability still is to detect and fix damage, or route around it.
3. Functional reserve: how much extra capacity is left, so that the system can handle shocks without failing.
4. Tail risk: how much of the total risk of failure sits in rare but very bad events, especially in late life.

The Tension Universe encoding turns these pieces into a single number called `Tension_age`. Roughly:

* low `Tension_age` means damage is small, repair is strong, reserve is high, and rare disasters are unlikely,
* high `Tension_age` means damage is big, repair is weak, reserve is thin, and rare disasters become more likely.

Q075 then imagines different kinds of worlds:

* In a “negligible aging” world, most of life happens with low `Tension_age`. Systems stay robust for a long time.
* In a “normal aging” world, `Tension_age` rises over time and eventually stays high. This is where diseases, frailty, and high death risk cluster.
* In “premature aging” or “extended longevity” worlds, the shape of the `Tension_age` curve changes in different ways.

Finally, Q075 says:

* We can test whether this way of organizing aging makes sense by checking if `Tension_age` really tracks health, survival, and the effects of interventions in real data, under a clearly defined encoding.
* If it does not, we change the way we measure damage, repair, reserve, and tail risks and record a new encoding instance.
* If it does, we can reuse the same ideas to think about aging in machines, organizations, and AI systems.

Q075 does not assert that it has found the final cause of aging. It offers a precise way to talk about aging as a pattern of growing tension in complex systems, in a way that can be checked, compared, and reused across many other BlackHole problems, while staying strictly within the effective layer.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the aging problem Q075 in terms of state spaces, observables, mismatch fields, and tension scores.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical aging theory in biology, thermodynamics, or information theory.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in biology has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No bottom layer axiom system or generating rule for TU is specified or assumed beyond what is already documented in the TU charters.
* No explicit mapping from raw biological or physical data to TU internal fields is provided. Only the structure that such mappings must respect is described.

### Encoding and fairness

* Any numerical use of this page (for example computing `Tension_age`) must pick and document a concrete encoding instance `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)` within the class defined in Section 3.6.
* Comparisons across groups, species, or interventions must use a single fixed `E*` unless a change of encoding is explicitly recorded and justified.
* Reference bands, weights, and thresholds must not be tuned separately for different arms in the same analysis to improve apparent results. Such tuning counts as a change of encoding, not as evidence for or against aging mechanisms.

### Falsifiability and future work

* Experiments in Section 6 specify falsification conditions for particular encoding instances `E*`. Rejection of an instance is normal scientific progress and does not count against TU as a whole.
* Moving Q075 from E1 to higher verification levels requires concrete tools, public tension profiles, and stable cross context behavior, as outlined in Section 9.
* Users are encouraged to treat this page as a structured hypothesis about how to encode aging tension, subject to revision under new data.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
