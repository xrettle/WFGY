## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this page is to specify an **effective layer encoding** for regeneration and repair, expressed in terms of:

  * state spaces,
  * observables and fields,
  * mismatch quantities,
  * tension scores,
  * counterfactual worlds,
  * falsifiable experiment patterns,
  * AI and engineering interfaces.

* This document does **not**:

  * prove or disprove the canonical biological problem in Section 1,
  * introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature,
  * claim that a particular microscopic pathway or model of regeneration is uniquely correct,
  * expose any TU bottom layer axiom system or generative rules.

* We do **not** provide any explicit mapping from raw biological data or microscopic physics to TU core fields.
  We only assume that for relevant systems and time scales there exist effective layer states and observables that satisfy the constraints listed here.

* Whenever this page speaks about “the encoding”, it refers to an **effective layer encoding class** and to concrete **encoding instances** `E*` as defined in Block 3.
  All experiments and AI uses in later blocks should be read as operating under some documented, fixed instance `E*`.

* Rejection of a particular encoding instance `E*` in experiments is treated as ordinary scientific falsification of that `E*`.
  It does **not** count as evidence for or against TU as a whole and does not resolve the canonical biological questions about regeneration.

The header line `Semantics: hybrid` means that this page allows encodings where effective states combine continuous fields (for example intensities of damage or flows) with discrete labels (for example phases of repair), as long as they respect the effective layer boundary described above.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem for Q076 is:

> Identify and formalize the core principles that govern regeneration and repair in multicellular organisms and engineered systems, including:
>
> 1. how damage is detected and localized,
> 2. how repair and regeneration processes are orchestrated across space and time, and
> 3. how trade offs between rapid repair, structural fidelity, and long term risk (fibrosis, organ failure, malignant growth) emerge from those processes.

In classical biological terms, regeneration and repair include:

* wound healing (hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, remodeling),
* partial organ regeneration (for example liver),
* full structure regeneration (for example salamander limb),
* chronic non healing states and fibrosis,
* cancer as misregulated or chronic repair.

Q076 does not attempt to prove any single universal theorem. It seeks an effective level description that:

* treats regeneration and repair as structured flows on a state space of damage and tissue states,
* defines observable quantities and mismatch measures that capture under repair, over repair, reintegration quality, regenerative capacity, and risk tails,
* explains why different organisms and tissues fall into different regimes of regenerative competence.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Regeneration biology is a mature experimental field, but it lacks a single agreed formal framework that:

* covers both high regeneration species and scar dominated repair in one language,
* makes trade offs and tail risks explicit as structured tension,
* is simple enough to apply across scales (cell, tissue, organ, organism).

Key facts at the classical level:

* Some vertebrates (for example salamanders, certain fish) perform near perfect regeneration of limbs and complex structures.
* Many adult mammalian tissues respond to major injury with scarring rather than true regeneration.
* Liver shows high regenerative capacity even in mammals, but still with limits and risk of chronic disease or cancer.
* Cancer is often described as a wound that does not heal, hinting at deep links between regeneration control and malignant transformation.

Q076 is hard because it must:

* respect known molecular and cellular mechanisms,
* remain neutral with respect to specific pathways,
* still produce a concise effective level formalism that can be used in other BlackHole problems and in AI systems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q076:

1. Provides the core biological template for self repair and partial reset of structure at the organism level.
2. Bridges Q071–Q075 (origins, genetic code, individuality, differentiation, aging) with higher level problems about life extension and population longevity.
3. Supplies reusable constructs for any node that needs a notion of:

   * structured repair flow,
   * balance of under repair versus over repair,
   * long tail risks from misrepair and malignant growth.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records Q076 in the BlackHole graph. All edges are Q identifiers with one line reasons pointing to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These nodes provide foundations that Q076 reuses.

* Q071 (BH_BIO_ORIGIN_L2_071)
  Reason: supplies minimal self maintenance and repair patterns in prebiotic and early life systems that Q076 extends to complex multicellular organisms.

* Q072 (BH_BIO_CODE_L2_072)
  Reason: defines how repair instructions and error correction strategies are stored in informational structures that regeneration must read and execute.

* Q073 (BH_BIO_TRANSITIONS_L2_073)
  Reason: explains how multicellular individuality and division of labor create bodies that can lose and rebuild parts without losing identity.

* Q074 (BH_BIO_DIFF_STABILITY_L2_074)
  Reason: provides stability and plasticity descriptors for cell differentiation that Q076 must perturb and reconfigure during regeneration.

* Q075 (BH_BIO_AGING_L2_075)
  Reason: introduces `DamageRepairBalanceIndex` and `AgingTrajectoryDescriptor` that Q076 reuses to distinguish regenerative reset from chronic drift.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These nodes reuse Q076 components directly.

* Q079 (BH_BIO_LIFE_EXTENSION_L2_079)
  Reason: reuses `RegenerativeCapacityProfile` and `RegenerationTensionFunctional` to evaluate life extension strategies.

* Q080 (BH_BIO_POP_LONGEVITY_L2_080)
  Reason: uses `RegenerativeCapacityProfile` across individuals to model population level survival and tail risks.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: reuses `RepairProgramPhaseDescriptor` as a template for representation repair phases in long running AI systems.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component reuse.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L2_059)
  Reason: both study maintenance versus degradation under resource constraints with risk_tail_tension, but Q059 focuses on information structures rather than tissues.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L2_032)
  Reason: both explore error correction and repair under physical constraints, but Q032 is at quantum information scale.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q076 to nodes in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q120 (BH_CS_SELF_REPAIR_L2_120)
  Reason: reuses `RegenerationTensionFunctional` as a template for evaluating under repair and over repair in distributed computing systems that self patch.

* Q121 (BH_SOC_INSTITUTION_REGEN_L2_121)
  Reason: reuses `RepairProgramPhaseDescriptor` to describe phases of institutional crisis response and long term regeneration after shocks.

All graph edges obey the BlackHole rules:

* 2 to 5 upstream,
* 2 to 5 downstream,
* 2 to 5 parallel,
* 2 to 6 cross domain,
* each with a single one line reason tied to a component, invariant, or tension type.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content here is at the effective layer. We describe:

* state space,
* observables and fields,
* mismatch measures and combined tension,
* encoding class and instances,
* singular set and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden TU generative rules or any direct mapping from raw data to internal fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a state space

```txt
M
```

whose elements represent coarse grained configurations of damage, repair, and regeneration in a multicellular organism or engineered system.

For each state `m` in `M`, we assume that it includes:

* a description of current structural and functional damage across regions,
* current activation state of local and global repair and regeneration programs,
* current estimates of regenerative capacity in each region,
* current estimates of misrepair and long term risk in each region.

We do not define how these summaries are constructed from molecular or imaging data. We only assume:

* for any finite set of regions and times of interest, there exist states in `M` that encode consistent summaries for those regions and times at the effective layer.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following observables on `M`. All are defined on the regular domain `M_reg` described later.

1. Damage pattern observable

```txt
Damage_pattern(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, region label `r`.
* Output: scalar summarizing structural and functional damage in region `r`.

2. Regenerative capacity observable

```txt
Regenerative_capacity(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, region label `r`.
* Output: scalar summarizing how much missing or damaged structure in region `r` can in principle be rebuilt with correct architecture and function.

3. Repair program phase observable

```txt
Repair_phase(m; r)
```

* Input: state `m`, region label `r`.
* Output: categorical label from a finite set such as:

  * hemostasis,
  * inflammation,
  * cleanup,
  * proliferation,
  * remodeling,
  * regeneration,
  * chronic non healing.

4. Integration quality observable

```txt
Integration_quality(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, region label `r`.
* Output: scalar summarizing how well new or repaired structures in region `r` integrate mechanically and functionally with surrounding tissue.

5. Misrepair risk observable

```txt
Misrepair_risk(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, region label `r`.
* Output: scalar summarizing risk for outcomes such as:

  * excessive scarring,
  * chronic non healing,
  * aberrant growth and malignant transformation.

These observables act on a finite set of regions for any concrete configuration. We do not require a specific geometry, only that region labels can be chosen and compared across time steps for given models or experiments.

All of these observables live at the effective layer. They are not claimed to be complete or unique descriptions of regeneration biology.

### 3.3 Mismatch fields

To encode regeneration tension, we define mismatch fields as nonnegative functions of the observables.

For a chosen set of reference bands, we define:

1. Under repair mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_underrepair(m) >= 0
```

* Measures unresolved damage and functional loss relative to a reference range in which damage is considered adequately resolved for long term health.

2. Over repair mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_overrepair(m) >= 0
```

* Measures excessive or misdirected repair activity, including excessive scarring and uncontrolled proliferation, relative to a reference range of controlled repair.

3. Reintegration mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_reintegration(m) >= 0
```

* Measures mismatch between new and existing structures, including mechanical misalignment and functional miscoupling, relative to a reference band of high quality integration.

4. Regenerative capacity mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_regen_capacity(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the gap between current regenerative capacity and a reference band representing high competence regeneration for the relevant tissue or system.

5. Risk tail mismatch for regeneration

```txt
DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the extent to which aggregated `Misrepair_risk(m; r)` and related long horizon risk measures place excessive probability mass in rare but severe outcomes such as:

  * organ failure after misrepair,
  * chronic non healing states,
  * malignant transformation.

* `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m) = 0` if long term misrepair and malignant tail risks lie within a reference band associated with low risk-tail tension for the system and context.

Each mismatch is built as a normalized difference between aggregated observables and a reference band, for example:

```txt
DeltaS_underrepair(m) = max(0, Index_under(m) - Band_under_max)
```

where `Index_under(m)` is an effective scalar summarizing unresolved damage, and `Band_under_max` is the upper edge of an admissible reference band.

### 3.4 Admissible reference library and fairness constraints

To prevent hidden tuning, we use an admissible reference library `L_ref_regen`:

```txt
L_ref_regen = {B_1, B_2, ..., B_K}
```

Each `B_k` is a set of parameter ranges defining a possible reference band for:

* unresolved damage,
* over repair,
* integration quality,
* regenerative capacity,
* long term misrepair and malignant tail risks.

We impose the following fairness constraints:

1. The library `L_ref_regen` is chosen before evaluating any concrete state `m` and is fixed for a given analysis or experiment.
2. For a specific analysis, one element `B_k` is selected from the library according to a rule that does not depend on the detailed configuration of the states being evaluated.
3. Once chosen, the element `B_k` and its band parameters are held fixed for all states compared in that analysis.

This means mismatch values cannot be adjusted retrospectively to produce a desired tension profile.

### 3.5 Encoding class and fixed instance

We group the elements above into an **encoding class** for Q076.

An effective layer regeneration encoding is specified by:

```txt
E = (D, F, W, L)
```

where:

* `D` is a data map that turns raw experimental or simulated inputs into effective layer states `m` in `M` with observables from Section 3.2.
* `F` is a family of functions that map observables to mismatch fields and to the combined tension quantities described below.
* `W` is a collection of numerical parameters:

  * reference band element `B_k` in `L_ref_regen`,
  * weights for the combined tension functional,
  * any thresholds used to define singular sets.
* `L` is the list of system classes for which this encoding is declared valid (for example particular species, tissue types, engineered systems).

Any concrete use of Q076 requires choosing a **fixed encoding instance**:

```txt
E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
```

that satisfies the fairness constraints in 3.4. All experiments, counterfactual worlds, AI modules, and roadmap statements in this page should be understood as operating under some such fixed instance `E*`.

When later blocks speak of “the current encoding” being rejected or revised, they mean:

> the particular encoding instance `E*` used in that context is rejected or revised at the effective layer.

Rejection of `E*` does not falsify the TU framework or any canonical biological theory.

### 3.6 Combined regeneration tension and tensor embedding

Given a fixed encoding instance `E*`, we define the combined regeneration mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_regen(m) =
    w_under * DeltaS_underrepair(m)
  + w_over  * DeltaS_overrepair(m)
  + w_reint * DeltaS_reintegration(m)
  + w_cap   * DeltaS_regen_capacity(m)
  + w_tail  * DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)
```

with constraints:

```txt
w_under > 0
w_over  > 0
w_reint > 0
w_cap   > 0
w_tail  > 0
w_under + w_over + w_reint + w_cap + w_tail = 1
```

Weights in `W*` are fixed in advance for a given analysis and are not tuned after observing results.

We then embed this mismatch into an effective tension tensor on `M`:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_regen(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` represents source like factors (for example magnitude and pattern of damage sources) in component `i`,
* `C_j(m)` represents receptivity like factors (for example sensitivity of global function or long term health) in component `j`,
* `lambda(m)` encodes the convergence state of repair programs (for example stable, oscillatory, divergent),
* `kappa` is a fixed coupling constant for this encoding instance.

The presence of `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)` as part of `DeltaS_regen(m)` means that this encoding lies in the **risk_tail_tension** family in the TU taxonomy. Regeneration related tail risks explicitly contribute to the overall tension.

We do not enumerate indices `i` and `j`. It is enough that for each state in `M_reg`, the tensor entries are finite and well defined.

### 3.7 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some configurations are not suitable for regeneration analysis, such as:

* states where damage or repair summaries cannot be defined,
* states where the system is globally dead,
* states where reference bands are not applicable.

Given a fixed encoding instance `E*`, we define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  any of DeltaS_underrepair(m),
         DeltaS_overrepair(m),
         DeltaS_reintegration(m),
         DeltaS_regen_capacity(m),
         DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)
  is undefined or not finite
}
```

All Q076 analyses at the effective level are restricted to the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

If a proposed experiment or computation attempts to evaluate mismatches for a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain and carries no direct implication for the principles encoded by Q076.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states Q076 as a structured tension principle.

### 4.1 Core regeneration tension principle

We use the combined mismatch `DeltaS_regen(m)` as the core scalar indicator of regeneration tension.

Informally:

* low `DeltaS_regen(m)` means damage, repair, reintegration, regenerative capacity, and risk tails are in a well balanced regime;
* high `DeltaS_regen(m)` means the system is in a problematic regime such as chronic under repair, misrepair dominated response, unstable reintegration, or high risk tail tension from misrepair and malignant outcomes.

We do not require any specific functional form beyond the constraints stated in Block 3. The principle is:

> Regeneration and repair outcomes can be understood as trajectories on `M_reg` that move through regions of low and high `DeltaS_regen`, constrained by architecture, resources, and control mechanisms.

### 4.2 Feasibility and trade off statements

We phrase two key statements at the effective level.

1. Regeneration feasibility statement

For a given architecture class and resource envelope, there exists a feasible region:

```txt
R_feasible subset of M_reg
```

such that for states `m` in `R_feasible`:

```txt
DeltaS_underrepair(m),
DeltaS_overrepair(m),
DeltaS_reintegration(m),
DeltaS_regen_capacity(m),
DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)
```

are all within acceptable bands defined by an element of `L_ref_regen`. This region corresponds to good quality regeneration or repair outcomes.

2. Regeneration trade off statement

For many architectures, under fixed control mechanisms and resource limits in `E*`, moving toward lower `DeltaS_underrepair` by increasing the strength or duration of repair programs tends to increase:

```txt
DeltaS_overrepair(m),
DeltaS_reintegration(m),
DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)
```

or related long term risk measures. To avoid this trade off, deeper architectural changes or new control modes are required, not just stronger versions of the same repair signals.

These statements do not claim exact boundaries or mathematical optimality. They define how Q076 uses the regeneration tension functional to distinguish different regimes:

* under repair dominated,
* balanced repair,
* over repair and misrepair dominated,
* high risk tail tension regimes.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe several counterfactual worlds, strictly at the level of observables and tension patterns. No internal generative rules are exposed. All worlds are defined under a fixed encoding instance `E*`.

### 5.1 World T: high regeneration competence

World T represents organisms or systems with high regeneration competence.

Key characteristics:

1. Damage resolution

* For many tissues and injuries, there exist trajectories `m_T(t)` in `M_reg` such that:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_underrepair(m_T(t))
  ```

  rapidly decreases to a low band and remains there over long times.

2. Structural fidelity

* `DeltaS_reintegration(m_T(t))` stays low, indicating that newly formed structures match original architecture and integrate well with surrounding tissue.

3. Controlled growth, low risk tails

* `DeltaS_overrepair(m_T(t))` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m_T(t))` remain within narrow bands consistent with low incidence of fibrosis, chronic non healing, and malignant transformation.

### 5.2 World F: scar dominated repair

World F represents organisms or systems that respond to large injuries mainly with scarring.

Key characteristics:

1. Rapid but coarse closure

* `DeltaS_underrepair(m_F(t))` drops quickly for gross structural measures, because wounds close and mechanical continuity is restored.

2. Poor reintegration

* `DeltaS_reintegration(m_F(t))` remains high, indicating mismatch between scar tissue and original structure, with impaired function.

3. Long term tail risk

* `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m_F(t))` and Misrepair_risk remain elevated, reflecting chronic problems such as stiffness, impaired perfusion, and increased risk of failure.

### 5.3 World C: hyper regenerative but cancer prone

World C represents systems where regeneration is powerful but poorly controlled.

Key characteristics:

1. Strong regeneration

* `DeltaS_underrepair(m_C(t))` often reaches very low values, because lost structures regrow.

2. Unstable control

* `DeltaS_overrepair(m_C(t))` frequently spikes, and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m_C(t))` is high due to episodes of uncontrolled growth or patterning failures.

3. High malignant transformation rate

* A significant fraction of trajectories `m_C(t)` move into regions of `M_reg` associated with pre neoplastic or malignant states, where risk tail tension dominates.

### 5.4 World R: engineered balanced regeneration

World R represents a target scenario for interventions.

Key characteristics:

1. Improved capacity

* `DeltaS_regen_capacity(m_R(t))` is reduced compared to baseline, indicating better regenerative potential in multiple tissues.

2. Controlled trade offs

* `DeltaS_underrepair(m_R(t))` is kept low while `DeltaS_overrepair(m_R(t))` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m_R(t))` remain comparable to or lower than baseline.

3. Stable reintegration

* `DeltaS_reintegration(m_R(t))` is kept within narrow bands that correspond to good mechanical and functional outcomes.

These worlds illustrate how different combinations of the mismatch fields correspond to qualitatively different repair regimes, without committing to specific molecular mechanisms.

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that test the Q076 encoding under a fixed encoding instance `E*`. They can falsify particular choices of mismatch definitions, reference bands, and weights in `E*`, but they do not decide the canonical biological problem by themselves.

### Experiment 1: Cross species regeneration tension comparison

*Goal:*

Test whether the chosen regeneration tension functional `DeltaS_regen(m)` and the mismatch components can robustly distinguish species with known high regeneration competence from those with scar dominated repair.

*Setup (under a fixed `E*`):*

* Select at least two species or system types with well studied responses to similar injuries, for example:

  * salamander limb amputation,
  * mouse or human limb or large skin injury.
* For each species and injury type, define:

  * a common set of regions `r`,
  * a common set of observables: `Damage_pattern`, `Regenerative_capacity`, `Integration_quality`, `Misrepair_risk` (and any additional observables used by `E*`).
* Choose an admissible reference band element `B_k` from `L_ref_regen` and weights `W*` before inspecting detailed outcomes.

*Protocol:*

1. For each species and time point after injury, use `D*` to construct effective states `m_species(t)` in `M_reg` encoding the chosen observables across regions.
2. For each state, use `F*` to compute:

   * `DeltaS_underrepair(m_species(t))`,
   * `DeltaS_overrepair(m_species(t))`,
   * `DeltaS_reintegration(m_species(t))`,
   * `DeltaS_regen_capacity(m_species(t))`,
   * `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m_species(t))`,
   * `DeltaS_regen(m_species(t))`.
3. Summarize trajectories for high regeneration species and scar dominated species as distributions over time of `DeltaS_regen` and its components.
4. Compare these distributions within the same reference band `B_k` and weight choice `W*`.

*Metrics:*

* Time averaged `DeltaS_regen` for each species and injury type.
* Peak values and time to return to low tension bands.
* Separation between distributions of `DeltaS_regen` across species, for example by simple distance or rank statistics.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If, across reasonable choices of `B_k` and weights `W*` that respect the constraints in Block 3, high regeneration species systematically show equal or higher `DeltaS_regen` than scar dominated species for comparable injuries and time windows, the current encoding instance `E*` is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small perturbations of mismatch definitions or reference bands inside the same encoding class cause reversals where the same species alternates between lowest and highest tension profiles without a clear biological explanation, `E*` is considered unstable and rejected for this application.

*Semantics implementation note:*

States `m_species(t)` are built using continuous fields for intensities (damage, repair flows, risk) combined with discrete labels for phases and events. The same representation choices in `D*` are applied to all species in the comparison.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying an encoding instance `E*` does not solve the canonical regeneration problem and does not falsify TU as a whole. It only shows that this particular effective layer encoding is not adequate for the cross species task considered.

---

### Experiment 2: Intervention effects on regeneration tension

*Goal:*

Test whether known interventions with pro regenerative or pro fibrotic effects produce systematic and interpretable shifts in the mismatch components and overall `DeltaS_regen`.

*Setup (under a fixed `E*`):*

* Choose a tissue injury model in a species where:

  * a pro regenerative intervention is known (for example specific growth factor combinations or stem cell support),
  * a pro fibrotic or chronic inflammation inducing condition is known.
* For each condition:

  * define pre intervention states `m_pre`,
  * define post intervention states `m_post` at multiple time points.

*Protocol:*

1. For each experimental condition and time point, use `D*` to construct states `m_cond(t)` in `M_reg` encoding the observables from Section 3.2.
2. Use `F*` and `W*` to compute mismatch components and `DeltaS_regen(m_cond(t))`.
3. For each condition, estimate:

   * change in `DeltaS_underrepair` between pre and post,
   * change in `DeltaS_overrepair`,
   * change in `DeltaS_reintegration`,
   * change in `DeltaS_regen_capacity`,
   * change in `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen`.
4. Compare intervention induced shifts to expected biological effects.

*Metrics:*

* Direction and magnitude of change in each mismatch component when pro regenerative interventions are applied.
* Direction and magnitude of change when pro fibrotic or chronic conditions are applied.
* Consistency of these changes across experiments and models.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If pro regenerative interventions with well established outcomes systematically increase `DeltaS_underrepair` and worsen `DeltaS_reintegration` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen` across models, the encoding instance `E*` is misaligned and rejected for this regeneration task.
* If pro fibrotic or chronic conditions systematically decrease both `DeltaS_overrepair` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen` without clear compensatory explanation, `E*` is considered suspect and must be revised or replaced.

*Semantics implementation note:*

All interventions are represented as changes in observable fields and phase labels over time, using the same representation scheme in `D*` across conditions. No hidden transformation is allowed to differ between interventions.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying `E*` for this experiment does not provide a full theory of regeneration. It only shows that a particular way of encoding regeneration tension does not match known intervention effects.

---

### Experiment 3 (optional): Cancer as misregulated regeneration

*Goal:*

Explore whether states that precede or accompany malignant transformation cluster in regions of `M_reg` with high `DeltaS_overrepair` and high `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen`.

*Setup (under a fixed `E*`):*

* Select models where chronic injury leads to increased cancer risk, for example:

  * chronic liver injury,
  * chronic skin wounding.
* For each model:

  * collect states along trajectories from healthy tissue through chronic injury to pre neoplastic and neoplastic states.

*Protocol:*

1. Use `D*` to construct states `m_chronic(t)` encoding observables in Section 3.2.
2. Use `F*` to compute mismatch components and `DeltaS_regen(m_chronic(t))`.
3. Identify regions in `M_reg` corresponding to:

   * pre injury,
   * chronic non neoplastic injury,
   * pre neoplastic,
   * malignant states.
4. Compare distributions of mismatch components, with emphasis on `DeltaS_overrepair` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen`, across these regions.

*Metrics:*

* Relative levels of `DeltaS_overrepair` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen` in each region.
* Presence of persistent high risk tail tension bands preceding malignant states.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If malignant and pre malignant states consistently appear in regions with low `DeltaS_overrepair` and low `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen` while chronic non neoplastic injuries occupy high risk regions, the mapping between mismatch components and risk in `E*` is considered misaligned and must be revised.

*Semantics implementation note:*

Different disease stages are encoded as discrete labels while damage, repair, and risk fields remain continuous. The same encoding scheme in `D*` and `F*` is used across all stages.

*Boundary note:*

This experiment checks one possible interpretation of cancer as misregulated regeneration inside a specific encoding instance `E*`. It does not settle the biology of cancer and does not exhaust possible TU encodings for this problem.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q076 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems in WFGY style settings. All signals and modules here operate on effective layer encodings produced by some fixed instance `E*`.

### 7.1 Training signals

We outline training signals that can be computed from internal representations mapped into Q076 observables under `E*`.

1. `signal_repair_vs_scar`

   * Definition: a scalar proportional to a combination of `DeltaS_underrepair(m)` and `DeltaS_reintegration(m)`.
   * Purpose: penalize responses in which massive scarring is presented as equivalent to full functional regeneration without mentioning the loss of structure and integration.

2. `signal_regen_vs_cancer_risk`

   * Definition: a scalar built from `DeltaS_overrepair(m)` and `DeltaS_risk_tail_regen(m)`, possibly combined with any additional risk tail indicators in `E*`.
   * Purpose: encourage models to mention cancer and misrepair risks when proposing very aggressive regenerative strategies.

3. `signal_regen_coherence`

   * Definition: a scalar that increases when the sequence of `Repair_phase` labels over time is inconsistent with known repair phases or when mismatch components move in directions that contradict the phase labels.
   * Purpose: discourage incoherent narratives where phases are skipped or tension evolves in implausible ways.

4. `signal_capacity_realism`

   * Definition: a penalty when `Regenerative_capacity` implied by the model for a given tissue is outside plausible bands given the species and context in `L*`.
   * Purpose: prevent unrealistic claims of full regeneration in contexts where evidence supports only partial repair.

All these signals depend on a single fixed encoding instance `E*` for a given training run.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We describe module patterns that reuse Q076 structures under `E*`.

1. `RegenerationTensionHead`

   * Role: a head that takes an internal representation of a biological or system context and produces estimates of:

     * mismatch components,
     * `DeltaS_regen`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embedding of the current context,
     * Output: vector of mismatch estimates and a scalar regeneration tension.

2. `RepairScenarioSimulator`

   * Role: an auxiliary module that simulates simple trajectories on `M_reg` under different interventions.
   * Interface:

     * Input: description of damage scenario and candidate interventions,
     * Output: discrete time sequence of approximate mismatch components and phase labels, interpreted under `E*`.

3. `MisrepairRiskFilter`

   * Role: a filter that evaluates candidate answers for implied misrepair and malignant tail risks.
   * Interface:

     * Input: candidate answer representation,
     * Output: risk score and optional flag to trigger clarification or caution in the final output.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness for AI systems that include Q076 style modules.

1. Task families

   * Explain differences between wound healing and true regeneration.
   * Evaluate hypothetical regenerative therapies for specific injuries.
   * Summarize experimental results from regeneration and repair studies.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline model: no explicit Q076 modules and no explicit `DeltaS_regen` signals.
   * Q076 augmented model: includes `RegenerationTensionHead` and `MisrepairRiskFilter`, and uses training signals from 7.1 as auxiliary objectives.

3. Metrics

   * Factual accuracy on test questions with known answers.
   * Trade off awareness: fraction of responses that explicitly mention long term risks when proposing strong regenerative actions.
   * Internal coherence: consistency between described phases and implied evolution of mismatch components.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple protocol for external users to experience Q076 style encoding, without exposing TU core rules.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask an AI system to explain how a particular tissue repairs itself after a major injury and why some species regenerate better than others.
  * Observation: record whether the answer clearly separates repair versus regeneration and whether it mentions trade offs and long term risks.

* Q076 encoded setup:

  * Prompt: ask the same question but explicitly instruct the model to structure the answer around:

    * under repair versus over repair,
    * quality of reintegration,
    * regenerative capacity,
    * long term misrepair risk and malignant tail risks.
  * Optionally allow the model to output qualitative descriptions of how `DeltaS_regen` behaves over time under `E*`.

* Comparison metric:

  * Human raters judge:

    * clarity of structure,
    * explicitness of trade offs,
    * realism with respect to known biology.

* What to log:

  * Prompts, responses, and any auxiliary Q076 style tension scores produced during generation under `E*`.
    These logs are diagnostics for the encoding, not evidence of microscopic truth about regeneration.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components from Q076 and direct reuse targets.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `RegenerativeCapacityProfile`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: state `m` in `M_reg`, list of regions.
     * Output: vector of capacity scores for each region.
   * Preconditions:

     * Regions must be defined and mapped to relevant tissues or modules.
     * There must be enough observational data to estimate `Regenerative_capacity`.

2. ComponentName: `RegenerationTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: mismatch components

       * `DeltaS_underrepair(m)`,

3. ComponentName: `RepairProgramPhaseDescriptor`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: time series of states `m(t)` in `M_reg` after a defined injury or perturbation.
     * Output: coarse phase labels over time and associated mismatch summaries.
   * Preconditions:

     * Phase labels must be chosen from a finite set known before the experiment.
     * Time sampling must be adequate to distinguish major phases.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q075 (Fundamental mechanisms of aging)

   * Reused components:

     * `RegenerativeCapacityProfile`,
     * `RegenerationTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Aging trajectories depend heavily on long term balance between damage and repair. Q076 provides quantitative descriptors for repair, regeneration capacity, and risk tails that can be integrated with aging indices.
   * What changes:

     * Time scale is extended to entire life histories.
     * Emphasis shifts toward interactions between repeated injuries, cumulative misrepair, and global functional decline.

2. Q079 (Life extension and human enhancement)

   * Reused components:

     * `RegenerativeCapacityProfile`,
     * `RepairProgramPhaseDescriptor`,
     * `RegenerationTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Many proposed life extension strategies involve enhanced regeneration or tissue engineering. Q076 components provide a framework to evaluate whether such strategies move systems toward World R like regimes with controlled risk tails.
   * What changes:

     * Interventions include engineered tissues, gene therapies, and artificial scaffolds.
     * Risk tail analysis is integrated with ethical and socio technical constraints.

3. Q080 (Population longevity and tail risk control)

   * Reused components:

     * `RegenerativeCapacityProfile`,
     * `RegenerationTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Population level longevity models depend on distribution of individual regenerative capacities, repair balance, and misrepair risk tails. The profile and functional components aggregate these features in a way compatible with demographic models.
   * What changes:

     * Fields are aggregated over individuals to create population level distributions and risk maps.

4. Q120 (Fault tolerant self repair in distributed systems)

   * Reused components:

     * `RegenerationTensionFunctional`,
     * `RepairProgramPhaseDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Distributed systems often undergo damage (node failures, data corruption) and perform repair. Q076 patterns provide a template for under repair versus over repair, and for phases of repair programs, including tails where misrepair leads to cascading failures.
   * What changes:

     * Regions correspond to nodes or modules rather than tissues.
     * Observables measure redundancy, load distribution, and consistency rather than biological damage.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q076 along the TU verification ladder and defines next measurable steps, all at the effective layer.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective level encoding class for regeneration and repair has been specified:

    * state space and observables,
    * mismatch fields including risk tail mismatch,
    * combined tension functional,
    * encoding class `E = (D, F, W, L)` and instances `E*`,
    * singular set and domain restrictions.
  * Multiple discriminating experiments with explicit falsification conditions for `E*` have been outlined.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connects:

    * under repair,
    * over repair and misrepair,
    * reintegration quality,
    * regenerative capacity,
    * risk tails,
      into a single tension framework.
  * Counterfactual worlds T, F, C, R have been described and distinguished in terms of mismatch patterns.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented under a documented encoding instance `E*`:

1. Construct an open data set where:

   * states `m_species(t)` for at least one high regeneration and one scar dominated species are instantiated,
   * mismatch components and `DeltaS_regen` are computed and published,
   * scripts for recomputing these quantities under `E*` are provided.

2. Implement a prototype tool that:

   * takes simple descriptions of damage and known regeneration outcomes,
   * returns approximate mismatch components and `DeltaS_regen`,
   * is validated on a small set of well studied regeneration and repair cases.

Both steps remain at the effective layer because they operate on observable summaries and do not reveal any deeper TU core mapping from raw data.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q076 is expected to:

* serve as the main node that explains why different architectures in biology and technology achieve different balances between repair, regeneration, and risk tails;
* provide stable components that can be reused whenever a BlackHole node needs a notion of structured self repair;
* bridge biological regeneration with non biological self repair in computing and socio technical systems.

Q076 does not claim that a single microscopic mechanism controls all regeneration. Instead it claims that:

* any coherent, testable theory of regeneration for complex systems should fit into a structure where `DeltaS_regen` and its components behave like those defined here under some encoding instance `E*`,
* this structure can be probed and falsified without exposing TU core axioms.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non technical explanation that stays aligned with the effective layer description.

When a body or system is damaged, several things must happen:

1. The damage must be contained so that it does not spread.
2. New material must be produced to replace what was lost.
3. The new material must be integrated into the old structure so that function is restored.
4. The whole process must be controlled so that repair does not turn into uncontrolled growth or dangerous scarring.

In some animals, like salamanders, this works so well that a lost limb can grow back with correct shape and function. In many adult mammals, large injuries heal with scars that protect the body but do not fully restore function. In some cases, repeated or misregulated repair contributes to cancer.

Q076 asks whether we can describe these very different outcomes using one simple set of quantities. It defines numbers that tell us:

1. How much damage is still unresolved.
2. How strong and how controlled the repair response is.
3. How well the new tissue fits with the old tissue.
4. How much true regenerative capacity remains.
5. How much long term tail risk builds up from misrepair, fibrosis, and malignant transformation.

These are turned into mismatch fields and combined into a single regeneration tension number `DeltaS_regen`. Roughly:

* low `DeltaS_regen` means damage is well handled, repair is neither too weak nor too strong, new structures fit well, and long term risk is low;
* high `DeltaS_regen` means the opposite.

The same language can be used for biology and for engineered systems that repair themselves.

Q076 does not claim a full theory of regeneration. It provides:

* a structured way to describe repair and regeneration as motion on a state space,
* explicit ways to test whether a given encoding instance `E*` matches known data and interventions,
* reusable tools that other problems can call when they need a notion of self repair and long term risk in a risk tail tension setting.

In the Tension Universe framework, Q076 is the main entry point whenever the question is not just whether something can repair, but how it repairs, what it gives up in the process, and what risks accumulate over time.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in biology, computation, or physics has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, encoding classes `E` and instances `E*`) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No TU bottom-layer axiom system, generating rule, or microscopic mapping from raw data to TU fields is exposed or assumed to be unique.
* Any concrete use of this page requires the choice of a documented encoding instance `E* = (D*, F*, W*, L*)`.
  All experiments and engineering uses test or apply `E*`, not TU as a whole.

### Encoding and fairness

* Reference bands, weights, and thresholds are chosen from admissible libraries before evaluation and are held fixed for the comparisons they support.
* Encoding instances are not tuned separately for different groups in a way that would invalidate cross group comparisons.
* Rejection of an encoding instance `E*` in experiments is treated as ordinary scientific falsification of `E*`, not as a failure of TU or of the underlying canonical theory.

### Relation to other TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
