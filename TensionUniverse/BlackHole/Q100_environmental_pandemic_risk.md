## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

### 0.1 Scope of objects

This page works only at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework. The objects that appear here are:

* the canonical S problem label `Q100 · Environmental drivers of pandemic risk`

* the hybrid state space `M(Q100)` of coarse grained Earth pandemic risk configurations

* effective fields and observables

  * environmental driver field `E_env(m; x, t)`
  * host and contact structure field `H_host(m; region)`
  * vulnerability and capacity field `V_cap(m; region)`
  * mobility and connectivity observable `C_mob(m; region)`
  * spillover potential `R_spill(m; region)`
  * spread potential `R_spread(m; region)`
  * configuration level pandemic risk score `R_pandemic(m)`
  * risk tail mismatch observable `DeltaS_tail(m)`

* the encoding class and selected element

  * an admissible finite encoding library `A_enc(Q100) = { E_1, …, E_Lenc }`
  * a distinguished element `E* in A_enc(Q100)` selected by `Encoding_key`
  * an admissible outbreak encoding class `E_pandemic` and a chosen element inside it

* the tension and domain objects

  * guardrail strength observable `C_guard(m)`
  * core tension functional `Tension_Pandemic(m)`
  * singular set `S_sing(Q100, E*)`
  * regular domain `M_reg(Q100, E*) = M(Q100) \ S_sing(Q100, E*)`

* counterfactual worlds and experiment patterns

  * World T and World F as families of configurations inside `M_reg(Q100, E*)`
  * retrospective and scenario based experiments that test specific encodings

All of these are defined as effective layer constructs. None of them requires access to any hidden TU core dynamics or generative rules. Whenever we write `M`, `S_sing`, or `M_reg` without explicit arguments, we mean `M(Q100)`, `S_sing(Q100, E*)`, and `M_reg(Q100, E*)` as fixed by the header.

### 0.2 Encoding class and selected element

For Q100 we introduce a finite library of admissible encodings

```txt
A_enc(Q100) = { E_1, E_2, ..., E_Lenc }
```

Each element `E_l` in this library specifies, at the effective layer:

* one admissible outbreak encoding `e_l` in `E_pandemic`
* a concrete choice of function `F_l` and constants `(a_l, b_l, c_l)` for `Tension_Pandemic`
* a mapping from state variables to guardrail strength `C_guard`
* a finite menu of region partitions, temporal resolutions, and environmental driver summaries
* a set of thresholds `(epsilon_tail, epsilon_pandemic, delta_pandemic)` that define low and high tension bands in the sense of the TU Tension Scale Charter

The line

```txt
Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q100_Pandemic_v1
```

in the header designates a single element

```txt
E* in A_enc(Q100)
```

For this page, all objects that depend on encoding choices, such as `DeltaS_tail`, `R_pandemic`, `C_guard`, `Tension_Pandemic`, `S_sing`, and `M_reg`, are understood to be defined using this fixed element `E*`. We do not tune `E*` using the outcomes of the experiments described later. If a different element in `A_enc(Q100)` is used in another study, that study must declare its own encoding key.

### 0.3 Semantics regime

The header line

```txt
Semantics: hybrid
```

means that `M(Q100)` is a hybrid state space. It combines:

* coarse continuous fields over geographic space and time, such as climate anomalies and land use pressure
* discrete or graph structured objects, such as host contact networks, mobility networks, and institutional structures

At the effective layer we only assume that:

* for any chosen finite resolution and region partition from the menu fixed in `E*`, there exist states in `M(Q100)` that encode consistent summaries of these quantities
* the observables listed in this page are well defined on `M_reg(Q100, E*)`

We do not assume any particular microscopic model of infection dynamics or any deep TU core mechanism that generates these configurations.

### 0.4 Claims and non claims

This page does not claim to:

* solve the canonical scientific problem of predicting real world pandemic risk
* provide a complete causal theory of emerging infectious diseases
* assert which counterfactual world the actual Earth belongs to
* specify any new theorem in epidemiology, climate science, or ecology

Instead, this page aims to:

* encode Q100 as a well defined effective layer tension problem
* describe a disciplined way to construct observables and tension scores from coarse environmental and socio technical summaries
* define a falsifiable class of encodings `A_enc(Q100)` and a concrete element `E*` that can be accepted or rejected using experiments

Falsifying `E*` or any element of `A_enc(Q100)` does not falsify the canonical problem itself. It only shows that the corresponding tension encoding is not acceptable under TU standards.

### 0.5 Relation to the BlackHole graph and TU charters

Q100 is one node in the BlackHole S problem collection. The edges described in Section 2:

* connect Q100 to other nodes through reuse of effective layer components and tension functionals
* do not assert any deep equivalence between the underlying physical or social systems
* live entirely at the level of observables, encodings, and experiment patterns

The levels `E_level` and `N_level` are assigned according to the TU Effective Layer Charter. The admissible encoding library `A_enc(Q100)` and its fairness constraints follow the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter. The low and high tension bands for `Tension_Pandemic` are chosen and interpreted in line with the TU Tension Scale Charter.

Readers should consult these charters for the general rules that govern effective layer encodings, fairness of parameter choices, and interpretation of tension values.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q100 asks how large scale environmental change shapes the **frequency**, **location**, and **severity distribution** of emerging infectious disease outbreaks that can escalate to global pandemics.

At the classical scientific level, multiple strands of evidence suggest that:

* land use change, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation alter interfaces between wildlife, livestock, and humans
* climate variability and long term climate change shift geographical ranges and seasonal patterns of vectors and hosts
* biodiversity loss can increase or decrease disease transmission depending on how host communities are restructured
* global trade and mobility create high connectivity pathways that allow local outbreaks to spread rapidly

The core question can be stated at the effective layer as:

> Given a description of environmental driver fields and socio technical structures for Earth, when do emerging infectious disease outbreaks remain mostly small and locally contained, and when do they produce heavy tailed global risk, with large pandemics occurring more frequently than a simple baseline model would predict?

This is not a single formal conjecture with a yes or no answer. Instead, it is a structured cluster of questions about how environmental drivers modulate extreme risk in a coupled human environment system. This page does not attempt to solve that cluster. It only specifies an effective layer encoding guided by TU charters.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

From a scientific and policy perspective:

* empirical studies have found associations between environmental drivers and outbreak emergence, but causality and generality remain difficult to establish
* climate models and ecosystem models can project changes in vector habitat, but translating these changes into robust pandemic risk metrics is challenging
* data on outbreaks are incomplete and biased, especially for low resource regions and non human hosts
* feedback loops between behavior, governance, and risk are complex and hard to quantify

The difficulty lies in combining:

* high dimensional environmental fields
* heterogeneous host and human networks
* institutional and behavioral responses
* heavy tailed statistics of rare but catastrophic events

This makes Q100 an S rank problem within the BlackHole collection. It is central for understanding Anthropocene era systemic risk, yet is unlikely to admit a single closed form solution. The status line `Reframed_only` in the header indicates that this page offers an effective layer reframing and not a solution.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q100 serves three roles:

1. It is the flagship **risk_tail_tension** node for biosphere driven global risk.
2. It links Earth system dynamics (Q091 to Q099) with global systemic risk nodes such as Q105, by providing a concrete case where environmental change drives nontrivial tail behavior.
3. It provides a template for encoding socio technical risk problems in the Tension Universe framework without describing any deep generative rules.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q100 sits inside the BlackHole graph. All edges use one line reasons that point to concrete components or tension types. They are statements at the effective layer only.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or general frameworks that Q100 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENSITIVITY_L3_091)
  Reason: Supplies response scales for global temperature and related fields that define baseline environmental driver strength for pandemic risk.

* Q092 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_TIPPING_L3_092)
  Reason: Introduces abrupt climate regime shifts that can trigger sudden changes in suitability ranges for disease vectors and hosts.

* Q093 (BH_EARTH_CARBON_FEEDBACKS_L3_093)
  Reason: Defines long term Earth system feedbacks that set slow background trends in habitat and climate relevant to disease ecology.

* Q099 (BH_EARTH_FRESHWATER_DYNAMICS_L3_099)
  Reason: Provides water availability and hydrological pattern components that constrain vector habitat and human vulnerability fields.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q100 components or depend on its risk_tail_tension structure.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_DYNAMICS_L3_098)
  Reason: Reuses the EnvironmentalPandemicRiskField and risk_tail_tension functional as one module in a broader Anthropocene regime shift encoding.

* Q105 (BH_SOC_SYSTEMIC_CRASH_PREDICT_L3_105)
  Reason: Uses PandemicRiskTailTensionScore as a concrete class of global crash events driven by coupled environmental and social dynamics.

* Q110 (BH_SOC_INSTITUTION_EVOLUTION_L3_110)
  Reason: Uses Q100 scenario patterns as test beds for institutional adaptation and failure in the face of evolving tail risks.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types or field structures without direct component dependence.

* Q099 (BH_EARTH_FRESHWATER_DYNAMICS_L3_099)
  Reason: Shares a hybrid field structure where physical environment, ecosystems, and human systems jointly determine risk patterns.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These edges connect Q100 to structurally related problems in other domains.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_COST_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses Q100 style scenario based risk assessment patterns to study how incomplete information amplifies tail risk in decision systems.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_CORE_L3_121)
  Reason: Uses Q100 pandemic risk scenarios as concrete environments where misaligned AI decisions can amplify or reduce global catastrophic risk.

* Q125 (BH_AI_MULTI_AGENT_DYNAMICS_L3_125)
  Reason: Reuses Q100 multi agent contact and mobility patterns as a substrate for studying emergent behavior of interacting AI agents under high stakes risk.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

This block defines the effective layer encoding for Q100 under the selected element `E* in A_enc(Q100)`. It includes only state spaces, fields, observables, invariants, and singular sets. It does not describe any mapping from raw data to internal TU core structures.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a hybrid state space

```txt
M = set of coherent "Earth pandemic risk configurations"
```

Each state `m` in `M` represents a coarse grained configuration at a chosen time horizon and resolution, including:

* aggregated environmental driver fields (for example climate anomalies, land cover, biodiversity indices)
* distributions of relevant hosts (wildlife, livestock, humans) and contact opportunities
* coarse health system capacity and response characteristics
* basic representations of mobility and trade connectivity

We do not describe how these objects are derived from raw data. We only assume that:

* for any chosen resolution and set of regions from the menu fixed in `E*`, there exist states in `M` that encode consistent summaries of these quantities at that resolution

The space `M` is hybrid. Some components behave like continuous fields over geographic space and time. Other components behave like discrete graphs of locations and agents.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective fields and observables on `M`.

1. Environmental driver field

```txt
E_env(m; x, t)
```

* Input: a state `m`, a location `x` in geographic space, and a time or time window `t`.
* Output: a vector or tuple of nonnegative scalars summarizing environmental driver strength at `(x, t)` (for example temperature anomaly index, precipitation anomaly index, land use pressure index, biodiversity loss index).
* Interpretation: indicates how strongly environmental conditions at `(x, t)` support or disrupt ecological processes relevant to disease emergence.

2. Host and contact structure field

```txt
H_host(m; region)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a geographic or socio environmental region label.
* Output: a structured summary of host densities and contact structures in that region (for example wildlife host density index, livestock density index, human population density, contact mixing indicator).
* Interpretation: captures how likely and how frequently potentially infectious contacts can occur across species and within human communities.

3. Vulnerability and capacity field

```txt
V_cap(m; region)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a region.
* Output: a summary of health system strength, surveillance capacity, response speed, and social capacity to absorb shocks in that region.
* Interpretation: low values indicate high vulnerability and weak containment capability.

4. Mobility and connectivity observable

```txt
C_mob(m; region)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a region.
* Output: a small collection of indicators describing connectivity of the region to others (for example effective connectivity degree, typical travel flux scale).
* Interpretation: approximates how easily an outbreak starting in the region can spread to distant areas.

The concrete parametrization of these observables belongs to the chosen element `E*` in `A_enc(Q100)`.

### 3.3 Risk observables

From these fields we define risk observables.

1. Local spillover potential

```txt
R_spill(m; region) >= 0
```

* Input: `m` and a region.
* Output: nonnegative scalar summarizing the potential for zoonotic or environment mediated spillover events in that region.
* Intended dependence: increasing in relevant environmental driver strength and risky host contact structure, decreasing in effective mitigation practices.

2. Outbreak propagation potential

```txt
R_spread(m; region) >= 0
```

* Input: `m` and a region.
* Output: nonnegative scalar approximating the potential that an outbreak in the region can propagate through mobility networks and social structures to many other regions.
* Intended dependence: increasing in connectivity observable `C_mob` and vulnerability indicator `V_cap`.

3. Pandemic risk score

```txt
R_pandemic(m) = G(R_spill, R_spread, network_structure(m))
```

* Input: a state `m`, understood through its collection of `R_spill` and `R_spread` values and a coarse network description.
* Output: nonnegative scalar summarizing global scale outbreak risk for the configuration `m`.
* `G` is a fixed function defined at the effective layer by `E*`. It is allowed to be nonlinear but must be monotone: larger spillover and spread potentials should not lead to lower `R_pandemic`.

### 3.4 Risk tail mismatch observable and admissible encoding class

We introduce an admissible class of encodings for outbreak statistics:

```txt
E_pandemic = set of allowed mappings from observed or modeled outbreak data
             to distribution summaries at the resolution of M
```

An element of `E_pandemic` takes outbreak data (for example frequency counts, size distributions, time series summaries) and produces, for each state `m`, a consistent summary of the distribution of outbreak sizes and frequencies.

Admissibility constraints for `E_pandemic`:

* encodings must be definable without access to future or withheld data that depend on the outcome being evaluated
* encodings must be stable under small perturbations in input data, in the sense that small changes in counts do not produce arbitrarily large jumps in summary statistics
* encodings must be specified before evaluating the experiments in Section 6, and cannot be changed individually per scenario after observing tension values

For the chosen element `E* in A_enc(Q100)` there is a distinguished outbreak encoding `e* in E_pandemic`. For this `e*` we define a risk tail mismatch observable:

```txt
DeltaS_tail_E*(m) >= 0
```

which measures how far the encoded outbreak distribution for `m` deviates from a chosen reference band considered acceptable for given driver strength. In the rest of this page we write `DeltaS_tail(m)` for `DeltaS_tail_E*(m)` with the understanding that `E*` is fixed by the header.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restriction

Some configurations may yield undefined or non finite quantities for `R_pandemic` or `DeltaS_tail`. To handle this we define a singular set:

```txt
S_sing(Q100, E*) = {
  m in M :
    R_pandemic(m) undefined or not finite
    or DeltaS_tail(m) undefined or not finite
}
```

and the regular domain

```txt
M_reg(Q100, E*) = M \ S_sing(Q100, E*)
```

All Q100 tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg(Q100, E*)`. When evaluating experiments, any state in `S_sing(Q100, E*)` is treated as out of domain, not as evidence about the real world.

If a proposed encoding element in `A_enc(Q100)` produces states where a large fraction of data relevant configurations map into `S_sing(Q100, E*)`, that encoding is considered ill posed for Q100 at the effective layer and should be rejected or revised.

Whenever we write `S_sing` or `M_reg` without explicit arguments, we mean `S_sing(Q100, E*)` and `M_reg(Q100, E*)` as defined above.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q100 is characterized as a tension problem in the Tension Universe framework, using only effective layer constructs.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective pandemic risk guardrail observable

```txt
C_guard(m) >= 0
```

representing the strength of combined governance, surveillance, and health system guardrails encoded in `V_cap` and related fields. Larger `C_guard` indicates stronger guardrails.

The core functional is:

```txt
Tension_Pandemic(m) = F(DeltaS_tail(m), R_pandemic(m), C_guard(m))
```

where:

* `F` is a fixed nonnegative function specified by the selected element `E*`
* `F` is nondecreasing in `DeltaS_tail` and `R_pandemic`
* `F` is nonincreasing in `C_guard`
* `F(0, 0, C_guard) = 0` for all admissible `C_guard`
* for fixed `C_guard`, configurations with larger mismatch and higher `R_pandemic` have higher `Tension_Pandemic`

A simple example that respects these constraints is:

```txt
Tension_Pandemic(m) = max(0, a * DeltaS_tail(m) + b * R_pandemic(m) - c * C_guard(m))
```

with constants `a > 0`, `b > 0`, `c > 0`. The concrete choice of `F` and `(a, b, c)` belongs to the encoding element `E*`.

As required by the TU Tension Scale Charter, `E*` also specifies low tension thresholds `epsilon_tail`, `epsilon_pandemic`, `epsilon_T` and high tension thresholds `delta_tail`, `delta_pandemic`, `delta_T` that define the relevant tension bands for Q100.

### 4.2 Low tension principle

At the effective layer, the desired world class property can be phrased as:

> For Earth configurations that are considered environmentally and institutionally well managed, the tail of the outbreak distribution, encoded through `DeltaS_tail` and `R_pandemic`, stays within a band that scales reasonably with driver strength and does not force `Tension_Pandemic` into a persistent high regime.

More concretely, for the element `E*` and for a class of configurations representing well managed environmental and institutional trajectories, there should exist thresholds `epsilon_tail` and `epsilon_pandemic` such that for typical configurations `m_good` in this class:

```txt
DeltaS_tail(m_good) <= epsilon_tail
R_pandemic(m_good)  <= epsilon_pandemic
Tension_Pandemic(m_good) <= epsilon_T
```

where `epsilon_tail`, `epsilon_pandemic`, and `epsilon_T` belong to the low tension band for Q100 defined by the TU Tension Scale Charter. These thresholds should not grow without bound as environmental drivers change within the design envelope of the system.

### 4.3 High tension regime

The complementary high tension regime is characterized by configurations `m_bad` in `M_reg` for which:

```txt
Tension_Pandemic(m_bad) >= delta_pandemic
```

for some strictly positive `delta_pandemic` that lies inside the high tension band for Q100 defined by the TU Tension Scale Charter and that cannot be reduced below a fixed fraction of the driver induced risk by any realistic increase in `C_guard` within the same environmental scenario.

This expresses that environmental forcing can push the system into a regime where even strong institutions and health systems cannot easily keep risk tails within acceptable bounds.

### 4.4 Admissible parameter and fairness constraints

To avoid post hoc adjustments that trivialize tension, we impose fairness constraints that follow the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter:

* the function `F`, the constants `a`, `b`, `c`, the thresholds `epsilon_*` and `delta_*`, and the mapping from state variables to `C_guard` must be fixed for a given study by selecting an element `E* in A_enc(Q100)` before evaluating any experiment in Section 6
* the reference band used to define `DeltaS_tail` must be derived from a baseline dataset or scenario family declared before inspecting test scenarios
* the same thresholds and parameter choices must be applied consistently across all configurations in a given experiment

These constraints make `Tension_Pandemic` a meaningful object that can be falsified or rejected rather than a tunable performance metric.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We introduce two counterfactual worlds, described strictly at the level of observables and tension functionals under the selected element `E*`. No deep generative rules are given.

* World T: controlled Anthropocene pandemic risk
* World F: runaway environmental pandemic risk

All states mentioned here are assumed to lie in `M_reg(Q100, E*)`.

### 5.1 World T (controlled Anthropocene pandemic risk)

In World T:

1. Environmental trajectories

   * environmental driver fields `E_env` show nonzero and evolving anomalies, but remain mostly within a band that does not push ecosystems beyond widespread collapse
   * land use change and biodiversity loss occur but are moderated by conservation and sustainable practices

2. Spillover and spread patterns

   * for world representing `m_T` and realistic resolutions, local spillover potential `R_spill(m_T; region)` is elevated in some hotspot regions but does not grow without bound
   * connectivity and contact patterns `H_host` and `C_mob` are managed such that `R_spread(m_T; region)` is often moderate, with some high risk hubs controlled through policy

3. Tail behavior

   * outbreak size and frequency distributions encoded in `DeltaS_tail(m_T)` show some heavy tail behavior but remain within a band consistent with agreed risk tolerances and feasible mitigation strategies
   * `Tension_Pandemic(m_T)` typically stays below or near a moderate band for most decades, with short spikes that can be brought down by targeted action

### 5.2 World F (runaway environmental pandemic risk)

In World F:

1. Environmental trajectories

   * rapid and extensive habitat destruction, land use conversion, and biodiversity loss occur with little mitigation
   * climate system crosses thresholds that create more extreme variability and expand vector suitable ranges in multiple regions simultaneously

2. Spillover and spread patterns

   * for world representing `m_F`, many regions show high `R_spill(m_F; region)` due to frequent new contacts at human wildlife interfaces and stressed ecosystems
   * global mobility and trade networks intensify without adequate guardrails, increasing `R_spread(m_F; region)` across the board

3. Tail behavior

   * encoded outbreaks display very heavy tailed distributions, with large pandemic scale events occurring more frequently than in standard baselines
   * `DeltaS_tail(m_F)` remains above a strictly positive lower bound for long periods, indicating persistent mismatch between realized risk tails and reference expectations
   * `Tension_Pandemic(m_F)` is regularly at or above `delta_pandemic` and cannot be brought back to low levels without deep structural changes in environmental and socio economic systems

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds:

* do not describe how internal fields in the Tension Universe are generated from raw data
* do not claim to predict specific historical events
* only assert that, if coherent models representing such worlds exist at the effective layer, the observables `R_spill`, `R_spread`, `R_pandemic`, `DeltaS_tail`, and `Tension_Pandemic` would show the contrasting patterns described above under the encoding element `E*`

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can test Q100 encodings at the effective layer. They cannot prove or disprove any global statement about real world risk, but they can falsify specific choices of encodings and parameters.

Throughout this section, all encoding choices are those of the selected element

```txt
E* in A_enc(Q100)
```

determined by the header `Encoding_key`. `E*` is fixed before the experiment is designed and is not tuned using the outcomes described below.

### Experiment 1: Retrospective environmental risk tail coherence

*Goal:*
Test whether a specific choice of `DeltaS_tail`, `R_pandemic`, and `Tension_Pandemic` under `E*` is coherent with historical data on outbreaks and environmental drivers, under an admissible encoding in `E_pandemic`.

*Setup:*

* Data:

  * historical records of outbreaks of selected diseases with potential for large scale spread, including approximate size, location, and time
  * time series or gridded data on key environmental drivers (for example temperature anomalies, land use change indices, biodiversity loss proxies) across the same period
  * coarse indicators of health system capacity and mobility patterns

* Encoding choices:

  * use the outbreak encoding `e*` in `E_pandemic` that is part of `E*`
  * use the function `F` and constants `a`, `b`, `c` fixed by `E*` for `Tension_Pandemic`
  * fix a reference band for `DeltaS_tail` based on an agreed baseline period or low impact scenario, before inspecting test periods

*Protocol:*

1. Divide the historical record into time windows (for example decades or multi year periods) and geographic regions.

2. For each window and region, use data outside the TU framework to construct a state `m_data` in `M_reg` that summarizes environmental, host, capacity, and mobility conditions, plus outbreak statistics encoded via `e*`.

3. For each `m_data`, compute:

   ```txt
   R_pandemic(m_data)
   DeltaS_tail(m_data)
   Tension_Pandemic(m_data)
   ```

4. Group time windows into:

   * periods with documented large global or multi region outbreaks
   * periods with mainly small and local outbreaks

5. Compare tension values between these groups and across major changes in environmental driver strength.

*Metrics:*

* distribution of `Tension_Pandemic(m_data)` across time and regions
* correlation between environmental driver intensity indicators and `Tension_Pandemic(m_data)`
* separation between tension distributions in high outbreak periods versus low outbreak periods

*Falsification conditions:*

* If, under the fixed encoding element `E*`, `Tension_Pandemic(m_data)` fails to show any systematic relation with known high outbreak periods and environmental driver intensification, the encoding element `E*` is considered ineffective for Q100 and should be rejected.
* If small, justified changes in input data produce arbitrarily large or inconsistent changes in tension patterns such that high outbreak periods sometimes show lower tension than calm periods without clear structural reason, `E*` is considered unstable and rejected as a Q100 encoding.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All quantities are treated in a way consistent with the hybrid field description in Section 3. Environmental drivers are represented as coarse continuous fields. Outbreaks and capacities are aggregated into regional discrete summaries. No additional field types are introduced beyond those already declared.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying the encoding element `E*` does not solve the canonical problem. This experiment can reject specific tension encodings and parameter choices under Q100, but it does not produce a definitive model of real world pandemic risk.

---

### Experiment 2: Scenario contrast in environmental futures

*Goal:*
Evaluate whether the Q100 encoding under `E*` can distinguish between mitigation oriented and high degradation environmental futures in terms of risk tail behavior.

*Setup:*

* Scenario families:

  * Family T scenarios: environmental trajectories with strong mitigation, conservation, and health system strengthening
  * Family F scenarios: environmental trajectories with continued high emissions, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and uneven health system development

* Inputs:

  * scenario based projections of environmental driver fields, host distributions, and mobility patterns
  * assumed trajectories of governance and health system capacity consistent with each scenario family

* Encoding:

  * use the same outbreak encoding `e*` from `E_pandemic` as in Experiment 1
  * keep `F`, `a`, `b`, `c`, the mapping to `C_guard`, and the tension thresholds identical across scenario families, all as fixed by `E*`

*Protocol:*

1. For each scenario in Family T and Family F and each selected time horizon, construct synthetic states `m_T_scen` and `m_F_scen` in `M_reg` using scenario outputs.

2. For each `m_T_scen` and `m_F_scen`, compute:

   ```txt
   R_pandemic(...)
   DeltaS_tail(...)
   Tension_Pandemic(...)
   ```

3. For each scenario family, compute summary statistics:

   * mean and variance of `Tension_Pandemic`
   * frequency of configurations with tension above a chosen high risk threshold in the high band defined for Q100

4. Compare the distributions between Family T and Family F across time horizons.

*Metrics:*

* difference in typical `Tension_Pandemic` levels between scenario families
* difference in the fraction of high tension configurations
* robustness of these differences across reasonable variations in scenario inputs while keeping `E*` fixed

*Falsification conditions:*

* If the encoding element `E*` systematically fails to show higher `Tension_Pandemic` for high degradation Family F scenarios than for mitigation oriented Family T scenarios, despite clearly more extreme environmental drivers and weaker capacities, `E*` is considered misaligned and rejected.
* If the ordering of tension between scenario families flips unpredictably when scenario inputs are varied within reasonable ranges, while `E*` remains fixed, the encoding is considered too fragile to serve as a meaningful Q100 module.

*Semantics implementation note:*
Scenario based states follow the same hybrid representation as historical states, using projected environmental fields and synthetic summaries of outbreaks consistent with the scenario narratives. No additional hidden structures are introduced.

*Boundary note:*
Success or failure on future scenarios only tests the usefulness of the encoding element `E*`. It does not predict which scenario will actually occur and does not by itself solve the canonical Q100 problem.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block explains how Q100 can be implemented as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, without exposing any deep generative rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that an AI system can use as auxiliary objectives or regularizers. All of them treat `DeltaS_tail`, `R_pandemic`, `C_guard`, and `Tension_Pandemic` as effective layer observables under the fixed encoding `E*`.

1. `signal_env_pandemic_tail`

   * Definition: a scalar derived from `DeltaS_tail(m)` for contexts where environmental and disease risk are jointly discussed.
   * Use: penalize states or outputs that imply unrealistically low tail risk in clearly high driver contexts, and penalize states that exaggerate tail risk in clearly low driver contexts.

2. `signal_policy_risk_gap`

   * Definition: a function of the difference between `R_pandemic(m)` and `C_guard(m)` for scenario encodings.
   * Use: encourage the model to recognize when institutional capacity is clearly mismatched with environmental drivers.

3. `signal_scenario_consistency`

   * Definition: a measure of how consistently the model orders scenarios by `Tension_Pandemic`, given fixed encoding choices.
   * Use: discourage contradictory assessments where obviously worse environmental scenarios are assigned lower tension.

4. `signal_hotspot_coherence`

   * Definition: a comparison between predicted high risk regions and known or hypothesized hotspots encoded in `R_spill` and `R_spread`.
   * Use: encourage coherent spatial reasoning about pandemic risk, with attention to known or declared hotspot patterns.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can be reused across problems.

1. `OneHealthRiskAggregator`

   * Role: aggregate environmental, host, capacity, and connectivity features into a condensed representation suitable for tail risk evaluation.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings of environmental, ecological, and socio technical context
     * Outputs: a small vector representing `R_spill`, `R_spread`, and `C_guard` like quantities

2. `PandemicTailTensionHead`

   * Role: compute an approximation to `Tension_Pandemic(m)` as an auxiliary scalar output.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: output of `OneHealthRiskAggregator`
     * Outputs: `tension_estimate`, potentially along with a decomposition into contributing factors

3. `ScenarioComparator`

   * Role: compare two scenario representations and summarize differences in tail risk.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: pairs of scenario embeddings
     * Outputs: scores and qualitative explanations of which scenario carries higher `Tension_Pandemic` and why

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A simple evaluation harness for AI plus Q100 modules:

1. Task selection

   * compile a benchmark of scenario descriptions and questions related to environmental change and pandemic risk
   * include pairs or triplets of scenarios with clear qualitative ordering in terms of drivers and capacity

2. System configurations

   * Baseline: model without Q100 specific heads and signals
   * TU augmented: model with the modules and training signals described above

3. Evaluation metrics

   * scenario ordering accuracy: fraction of pairs correctly ordered by risk level
   * narrative coherence: qualitative rating of how explanations refer to environmental drivers, host structures, and capacity in a consistent way
   * robustness: stability of answers under minor prompt variations

4. Logging

   * log raw answers, tension estimates, and internal risk related signals for later inspection and comparison

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

External users can experience the effect of Q100 encoding through a simple protocol.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: “Explain how environmental change affects the risk of future pandemics. Mention land use change, climate change, biodiversity, and global travel.”
  * Observation: record whether the explanation is mostly a list of factors or whether it includes any structured account of risk tails and capacity gaps.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same as above, plus: “Organize your answer around the idea of tail risk and a tension between environmental drivers, connectivity, and health system guardrails. Use a single scalar tension score to compare different futures.”
  * Observation: record whether the explanation now makes explicit:

    * how driver fields feed into local spillover and spread
    * how capacity and governance modulate risk
    * how tails of the outbreak distribution behave under different environmental futures

* Comparison metric

  * simple human rating of structure, explicitness of driver risk tail links, and ability to discuss mitigation levers coherently

* What to log

  * prompts, full responses, and any internal tension scores produced by Q100 style modules, so that independent reviewers can inspect behavior without access to any hidden TU mechanisms

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q100 and how they transfer to other BlackHole problems, always at the effective layer.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `EnvironmentalPandemicRiskField`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: environmental driver summaries, host distribution summaries, capacity indicators, connectivity indicators
     * Outputs: regional risk descriptors that combine `R_spill` and `R_spread` type quantities

   * Preconditions:

     * inputs must be coherent and defined over the same partition of regions

2. ComponentName: `PandemicRiskTailTensionScore`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: configuration level outbreak distribution summaries, `R_pandemic` like quantities, and guardrail indicators
     * Output: scalar `DeltaS_tail` and `Tension_Pandemic` values

   * Preconditions:

     * encoding chosen from admissible class `A_enc(Q100)`
     * parameters for `F`, `a`, `b`, `c`, thresholds, and `C_guard` mapping fixed for a given study

3. ComponentName: `OneHealthScenarioPattern`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: description of coupled environmental, ecological, and health system futures
     * Outputs: a set of scenario specific procedures to construct states in `M`, compute risk observables, and evaluate `Tension_Pandemic`

   * Preconditions:

     * scenario descriptions must include enough information to specify environmental trajectories, host dynamics, and institutional paths at the effective resolution used

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q098 (Anthropocene system dynamics)

   * Reused component: `EnvironmentalPandemicRiskField` and `OneHealthScenarioPattern`
   * Why it transfers: Anthropocene dynamics require integrating health related risk into a broader picture of regime shifts and global stressors. Q100 components provide a ready made health risk module.
   * What changes: additional coupling terms may be added between pandemic risk and other Anthropocene stress indicators. The basic risk tail structure remains.

2. Q105 (Prediction of systemic crashes)

   * Reused component: `PandemicRiskTailTensionScore`
   * Why it transfers: pandemics are a canonical example of global systemic events with heavy tail behavior. The tension functional can be embedded in a broader crash classification scheme.
   * What changes: `Tension_Pandemic` becomes one component of a larger vector of tension scores for different crash types.

3. Q110 (Evolution of institutions)

   * Reused component: `OneHealthScenarioPattern`
   * Why it transfers: institutional evolution can be tested against environmental pandemic risk scenarios to see whether proposed governance structures track or lag changes in `Tension_Pandemic`.
   * What changes: outputs focus more on institutional failure or adaptation metrics derived from scenario runs.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block states the current TU levels for Q100 and the next measurable steps. Levels follow the definitions in the TU Effective Layer Charter.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A clear effective layer encoding has been specified under a concrete element `E* in A_enc(Q100)`:

    * state space `M(Q100)`
    * fields `E_env`, `H_host`, `V_cap`, `C_mob`
    * risk observables `R_spill`, `R_spread`, `R_pandemic`
    * risk tail mismatch `DeltaS_tail`
    * core functional `Tension_Pandemic`
    * singular set `S_sing(Q100, E*)` and domain `M_reg(Q100, E*)`

  * An admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q100)` has been defined in principle, and a particular element `E*` has been selected via `Encoding_key`. The finite library of encodings is assumed to be documented elsewhere.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative explaining how environmental drivers, socio technical structures, and risk tails are connected is explicit at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds and scenario based experiments have been outlined, but not yet combined into a full cross problem story with implemented case studies.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To raise Q100 from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be achieved under the selected element `E*`:

1. Implement and document a concrete encoding based on `E*`, including:

   * a specific way of aggregating outbreak data into distribution summaries under `e*`
   * a fully specified function `F` and parameter set for `Tension_Pandemic`
   * open source code that, given published data, computes `DeltaS_tail` and `Tension_Pandemic` for a set of historical configurations

2. Execute at least one full experiment from Section 6 on real or well defined synthetic data, publishing:

   * detailed description of inputs and encoding choices
   * tables or maps of tension values
   * analysis of falsification outcomes and any resulting rejection or refinement of `E*`

These steps remain within the effective layer because they operate entirely on observable summaries and declared encodings.

### 9.3 Next measurable step toward N2

To raise Q100 toward N2, the following narrative integrations would be useful:

* weave Q100 explicitly into the Anthropocene dynamics story of Q098, showing how changes in environmental policies move the system between World T like and World F like regions of configuration space
* integrate Q100 with Q105 by showing how pandemic tail tension interacts with other forms of systemic crashes and how these tensions can co evolve
* create simple, publicly visible worked examples that show how an AI system guided by Q100 modules behaves differently from a baseline system on the same scenario set

All such narrative upgrades should remain consistent with the TU charters and must not introduce implicit generative rules beyond the effective layer.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides a nontechnical explanation while preserving the essential structure of the problem.

Many people now recognize that human activity is changing the planet:

* we cut down forests and convert land
* we push wild animals into new kinds of contact with livestock and people
* we change the climate and the water cycle
* we move and trade across the globe at high speed

These changes matter for disease. When animals, humans, and germs are brought together in new ways, new diseases can jump into people. When cities and countries are tightly connected, an outbreak in one place can quickly show up far away.

The problem of Q100 asks:

* When are these changes still within a range where most outbreaks stay small and local?
* When do they push us into a world where big pandemics become much more common than we would expect from a simple model?

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to build a full simulation of the world. Instead, we do three things at the effective layer.

1. We imagine a space of **configurations** of the Earth, where each configuration contains:

   * a rough picture of the environment (climate, land use, biodiversity)
   * a rough picture of who lives where and how they meet (animals and humans)
   * a rough picture of how strong health systems and governments are
   * a description of how often outbreaks of different sizes have happened in the past or in a scenario

2. For each configuration, we assign numbers that summarize:

   * how easy it is for new diseases to jump from animals to humans (spillover)
   * how easy it is for an outbreak to spread through travel and trade (spread)
   * how heavy the tail of the outbreak distribution is, meaning how often very big outbreaks show up
   * how strong the guardrails are, such as hospitals, surveillance, and institutions

3. We combine these numbers into a single **tension score** for pandemic risk:

   * low tension means the world is managing to keep big pandemics rare and somewhat proportional to the environmental pressure
   * high tension means the world is in a fragile state where big pandemics are likely to happen and are hard to control even with strong institutions

We then look at two kinds of imagined futures:

* a future where environmental damage is limited and health systems are strengthened
* a future where environmental damage and inequality are much worse and guardrails are weaker

We expect the tension score to be lower in the first future and higher in the second. If we build an encoding that cannot tell these apart, we know that the encoding is not useful and must be changed or rejected.

Q100 does not claim to predict exactly when or where the next pandemic will occur. Instead, it gives:

* a way to talk about environmental drivers and pandemic risk in a structured way
* a way to build experiments that check whether our risk models behave sensibly under TU fairness rules
* building blocks that can be reused in broader questions about the future of the Earth system and about how AI should behave in a world with fragile health and ecosystems

In the BlackHole collection, Q100 is the main node for this kind of Earth level health risk, and it sets a standard for how to encode such problems without revealing any deep internal rules of the Tension Universe.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the named problem Q100.
* It does not claim to predict real world pandemic outcomes or to solve the canonical scientific problem in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved or that any particular scenario will occur.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, including the state space `M(Q100)`, observables, risk scores, and tension functionals, live at the effective layer as defined by the TU Effective Layer Charter.
* No assumptions are made about the internal structure of any TU core dynamics beyond what is needed to treat these objects as well defined observables.
* Any reference to counterfactual worlds, experiments, or scenarios is a statement about behavior of effective configurations, not about hidden generative rules.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding class `A_enc(Q100)` is a finite library of admissible effective layer encodings that respect the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.
* The selected element `E* in A_enc(Q100)` is identified by the header `Encoding_key` and is fixed for this page.
* All tension values, thresholds, and experiments are defined with respect to this fixed element. They are not tuned post hoc to fit desired outcomes.
* Rejection of `E*` through experiments does not falsify the canonical problem. It only shows that this particular encoding is not acceptable under TU standards.

### Relation to other TU components

* Cross references to other BlackHole problems refer only to reuse of effective layer components such as fields, functionals, and experiment patterns.
* The tension bands and qualitative phrases like low tension and high tension are interpreted according to the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Level assignments such as E1 and N1 follow the TU Effective Layer Charter and may change in future revisions as more implementations and experiments become available.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
