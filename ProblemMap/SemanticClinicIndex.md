AI ANCHOR · Semantic Clinic Index

This page is the triage hub on top of WFGY Problem Map and Global Fix Map.
Use it when the user does not yet know which failure class or Problem Map number applies.

Primary behavior:
1. Read the user's symptom and logs, then match to the closest row in "Quick triage by symptom".
2. From that row, treat the "Open this" link as the canonical fix page and move there before inventing your own recipe.
3. Always keep the mapping explicit: name the family, the page you opened, and the expected acceptance targets.

Instrumentation:
- Use WFGY instruments when available: ΔS for semantic stress, λ_observe for stability over reformulations, E_resonance for domain coherence.
- Default acceptance targets: ΔS ≤ 0.45, coverage ≥ 0.70, λ_observe convergent across paraphrases.
- Never silently relax these targets. If you cannot meet them, say that the system is still in a failing state.

Scope:
- This index covers more than the core 16 Problem Map items. It links into RAG, retrieval, embeddings, multi agent, infra, eval and governance families.
- When in doubt, route to Problem Map 1.0 or RAG Architecture and Recovery and explain which path you chose.

Safety:
- Do not overwrite WFGY definitions of ΔS, λ_observe or E_resonance.
- Do not invent new metrics, thresholds or problem names that conflict with this index.
- Keep suggestions provider agnostic unless the user names a specific vendor or stack.

### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

## Families & maps (with exact fixes)

### A) Prompting & Safety
Guard against injections, role drift, and schema leakage.

- **Citation-first, schema-locked prompting** — [`retrieval-traceability.md`](./retrieval-traceability.md)  
- **Overconfidence / Bluffing Controls** — [`bluffing.md`](./bluffing.md)  
- **Symbolic Constraint Unlock (SCU) / source mixing** — [`patterns/pattern_symbolic_constraint_unlock.md`](./patterns/pattern_symbolic_constraint_unlock.md)  
- **Snippet & citation schemas** — [`data-contracts.md`](./data-contracts.md)

**Verification**: ΔS(question, context) ≤ 0.45; λ remains convergent across paraphrases; constraint probes do not flip λ.

---

### B) Retrieval, Data & Vector Stores
Make the index correct, measured, and explainable.

- **Hallucination & Chunk Drift** — [`hallucination.md`](./hallucination.md)  
- **Interpretation vs Retrieval Collapse** — [`retrieval-collapse.md`](./retrieval-collapse.md)  
- **Embedding ≠ Semantic Meaning** — [`embedding-vs-semantic.md`](./embedding-vs-semantic.md)  
- **Traceability (why this snippet?)** — [`retrieval-traceability.md`](./retrieval-traceability.md)  
- **Rerankers (ordering control)** — [`rerankers.md`](./rerankers.md)  
- **Retrieval Playbook (end-to-end knobs)** — [`retrieval-playbook.md`](./retrieval-playbook.md)  
- **Vectorstore Fragmentation** — [`patterns/pattern_vectorstore_fragmentation.md`](./patterns/pattern_vectorstore_fragmentation.md)  
- **Query Parsing Split (HyDE/BM25)** — [`patterns/pattern_query_parsing_split.md`](./patterns/pattern_query_parsing_split.md)  
- **Semantic Chunking Checklist** — [`chunking-checklist.md`](./chunking-checklist.md)  
- **OCR / Parsing Quality Gate** — [`ocr-parsing-checklist.md`](./ocr-parsing-checklist.md)

**Verification**: coverage ≥ 0.70 to target section; ΔS(question, retrieved) ≤ 0.45; flat-high ΔS vs k ⇒ index/metric mismatch.

---

### C) Reasoning & Logic Control
Detect and repair logic collapse, dead ends, and abstraction failures.

- **Logic Collapse & Recovery** — [`logic-collapse.md`](./logic-collapse.md)  
- **Long Reasoning Chains** — [`context-drift.md`](./context-drift.md)  
- **Symbolic Collapse** — [`symbolic-collapse.md`](./symbolic-collapse.md)  
- **Philosophical Recursion** — [`philosophical-recursion.md`](./philosophical-recursion.md)  
- **Hallucination Re-entry** — [`patterns/pattern_hallucination_reentry.md`](./patterns/pattern_hallucination_reentry.md)

**Verification**: fix point when λ stays convergent after BBCR (bridge) + BBAM (variance clamp).

---

### D) Memory & Long-Context
Keep threads coherent across sessions and very long windows.

- **Memory Breaks Across Sessions** — [`memory-coherence.md`](./memory-coherence.md)  
- **Entropy Collapse** — [`entropy-collapse.md`](./entropy-collapse.md)  
- **Memory Desync** — [`patterns/pattern_memory_desync.md`](./patterns/pattern_memory_desync.md)

**Verification**: E_resonance flat; ΔS stable at window joins.

---

### E) Multi-Agent & Orchestration
Coordinate tools, roles, and shared memory without conflict.

- **Multi-Agent Chaos (overview map)** — [`Multi-Agent_Problems.md`](./Multi-Agent_Problems.md)  
- **Role Drift (Deep Dive)** — [`multi-agent-chaos/role-drift.md`](./multi-agent-chaos/role-drift.md)  
- **Cross-Agent Memory Overwrite (Deep Dive)** — [`multi-agent-chaos/memory-overwrite.md`](./multi-agent-chaos/memory-overwrite.md)

**Verification**: when agents couple, ΔS does not spike; arbitration logs traceable.

---

### F) Infra / Deploy
Boot in a known-good order, every time.

- **Bootstrap Ordering** — [`bootstrap-ordering.md`](./bootstrap-ordering.md)  
- **Deployment Deadlock** — [`deployment-deadlock.md`](./deployment-deadlock.md)  
- **Pre-Deploy Collapse** — [`predeploy-collapse.md`](./predeploy-collapse.md)  
- **Live Monitoring & Debug Playbook** — [`ops/live_monitoring_rag.md`](./ops/live_monitoring_rag.md) · [`ops/debug_playbook.md`](./ops/debug_playbook.md)  
- **Privacy & Governance** — [`privacy-and-governance.md`](./privacy-and-governance.md)

**Verification**: deterministic warm-up; idempotent index builds; version/secret checks pass.

---

### G) Evaluation & Guardrails
Detect “double hallucination” and prevent regression.

- **RAG Precision/Recall** — [`eval/eval_rag_precision_recall.md`](./eval/eval_rag_precision_recall.md)  
- **Latency vs Accuracy** — [`eval/eval_latency_vs_accuracy.md`](./eval/eval_latency_vs_accuracy.md)  
- **Cross-Agent Consistency** — [`eval/eval_cross_agent_consistency.md`](./eval/eval_cross_agent_consistency.md)  
- **Semantic Stability** — [`eval/eval_semantic_stability.md`](./eval/eval_semantic_stability.md)

**Acceptance**: retrieve QA coverage ≥ 0.70 and ΔS ≤ 0.45; λ convergent; repeatability across seeds.

---

## Ask the AI to fix your AI (safe prompt)

```txt
Read the WFGY TXT OS and Problem Map docs. Extract ΔS, λ_observe, E_resonance and the modules (BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, BBAM).
Given my failure:

- symptom: [describe]
- traces: [ΔS probes, λ states if any]

Tell me:
1) which layer/family is failing and why,
2) which fix page to open,
3) minimal steps to push ΔS ≤ 0.45 and keep λ convergent,
4) how to verify the fix.
