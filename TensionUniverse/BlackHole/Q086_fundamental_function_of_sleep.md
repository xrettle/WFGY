## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework:

* We only specify observables, tension indicators, functionals, extremality patterns, and testable predictions.
* We do **not** specify any underlying axiom system, generating rules, or constructive derivations of TU itself.
* We do **not** provide any explicit mapping from raw neuroscience or behavioural data to internal TU fields; we only assume the existence of TU compatible models that reproduce the listed observables.

This entry should be read together with the TU charters listed in the footer, which specify global constraints on effective layer encodings, fairness, and tension scales.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical form of the problem can be stated as follows:

> Fundamental function of sleep:
> Why do specific neural, physiological, and behavioural processes that we label "sleep" appear to be conserved across species, metabolically expensive, and tightly regulated, and what core functions do they serve that cannot be fully replaced by wakefulness or simple rest?

More concretely, the hard question is:

* Given that sleep:

  * consumes significant time and energy,
  * imposes vulnerability to predation and environmental hazards,
  * shows strongly regulated homeostatic and circadian control,

  what multi function role does sleep play such that species with complex nervous systems retain it, and what is the minimal set of functions that require sleep like states instead of purely waking or pharmacologic alternatives?

The canonical problem is not limited to one single function (for example "memory consolidation" only). It asks whether we can identify:

* a constrained set of core functions,
* associated invariants or trade offs,
* and conditions under which the absence or radical alteration of sleep leads to systematic failure in cognitive, physiological, or survival outcomes.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Empirically, many functions of sleep have been proposed, including:

* synaptic and representational reorganization,
* memory consolidation and integration,
* removal of metabolic waste and restoration of cellular homeostasis,
* regulation of affect, stress, and immune function.

However, there is still no single universally accepted theory that:

* explains cross species differences and similarities,
* unifies cognitive, metabolic, and developmental roles,
* and identifies a clearly irreplaceable function of sleep that cannot be substituted by other states.

Difficulties include:

* strong multi function character: different species and developmental phases may emphasise different roles;
* measurement constraints: sleep involves whole organ and body level processes that are hard to isolate experimentally;
* ethical and practical limits on humans: long term extreme manipulations are not feasible;
* confounding factors: sleep restriction often co occurs with stress, environment change, or illness.

The problem is therefore considered open at the level of a unified, quantitatively constrained theory. Many partial models exist for specific aspects such as synaptic homeostasis, glymphatic clearance, or memory replay, but none fully resolve the overall "why sleep at all" question.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q086 plays several roles:

1. It is the central sleep and systems neuroscience node, where cognitive_tension and thermodynamic_tension interact.
2. It links the "hard problem of consciousness" cluster (Q081–Q085) to neurodegeneration, development, and AI analogues of maintenance phases.
3. It provides a prototype for encoding multi function biological processes within the Tension Universe (TU) at the effective layer:

   * combining architecture level observables,
   * cognitive and behavioural outcomes,
   * metabolic and clearance markers,

   into a single tension functional.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q086 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Edges are listed with single line reasons that point to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or general foundations that Q086 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)
  Reason: Provides the abstract framing of subjective experience and cognitive processes that sleep must modulate or support.
* Q082 (BH_NEURO_BINDING_L3_082)
  Reason: Supplies the notion of distributed neural patterns that must remain integrated across wake sleep transitions.
* Q083 (BH_NEURO_CODING_L3_083)
  Reason: Provides coding level tools for how waking experience is encoded and later reorganised during sleep.
* Q084 (BH_NEURO_MEMORY_STORE_L3_084)
  Reason: Encodes memory systems and long term storage constraints that sleep is hypothesised to maintain.
* Q085 (BH_NEURO_PLASTICITY_RULES_L3_085)
  Reason: Gives plasticity rules whose saturation and stability properties are central to sleep related homeostasis hypotheses.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse components of Q086 or depend on its tension structure.

* Q087 (BH_NEURO_NEURODEGEN_L3_087)
  Reason: Uses sleep related maintenance and clearance tension components to model neurodegeneration risk.
* Q088 (BH_NEURO_DEV_CRIT_WINDOWS_L3_088)
  Reason: Reuses sleep function components to constrain developmental critical windows and reorganisation phases.
* Q089 (BH_NEURO_PRED_ERROR_L3_089)
  Reason: Incorporates sleep modulation of predictive coding and error minimisation across wake sleep cycles.
* Q090 (BH_NEURO_EMOTION_REG_L3_090)
  Reason: Uses sleep mediated regulation of affect and stress as one channel for explaining emotional stability.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)
  Reason: Shares focus on subjective experience and cognitive integration but does not directly depend on sleep architecture.
* Q083 (BH_NEURO_CODING_L3_083)
  Reason: Both deal with temporal coding and reorganisation but Q083 can be posed without explicit sleep dynamics.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q086 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: Reuses sleep driven constraints on human capacity and error rates as micro level constraints on large scale anthropocene risk accumulation.
* Q100 (BH_SOC_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)
  Reason: Uses sleep disruption and sleep dependent immune function as one factor modulating vulnerability and resilience in population level models.
* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Uses the sleep multi function template as an analogue for maintenance and consolidation phases in AI systems.

All edges are expressed using Q indices only, without external URLs, so that the full Q001–Q125 graph can be assembled as a consistent adjacency list.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* mismatch quantities and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any mapping from raw data to TU internal fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

`M_sleep`

with the following effective interpretation:

* Each element `m` in `M_sleep` represents a coherent sleep world configuration over some multi day time window for an organism or group, including:

  * sleep stage sequences and durations,
  * neural dynamical summaries,
  * metabolic and clearance summaries,
  * behavioural and cognitive outcome summaries.

We do not specify how raw electrophysiology, imaging, metabolic assays, or behavioural logs are mapped into `M_sleep`. We only assume:

* For any reasonable time window and organism class, there exist states `m` in `M_sleep` that encode coherent summaries sufficient to evaluate the observables defined below.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables and fields on `M_sleep`.

1. Sleep architecture observable

   ```txt
   Arch_stage(m)
   ```

   * Output: a structured summary of sleep architecture in `m`, including total sleep time, fraction of time in each stage, fragmentation indices, and macro scale sequence patterns.
   * Interpretation: different values of `Arch_stage(m)` represent different high level sleep patterns, not the underlying raw time series.

2. Neural dynamical observable

   ```txt
   Dyn_osc(m; region, band)
   ```

   * Output: effective measures of oscillatory power and pattern statistics for a specified brain region and frequency band, aggregated over sleep and wake segments within the time window represented by `m`.

3. Metabolic and clearance observable

   ```txt
   Met_clear(m; window)
   ```

   * Output: effective indicators of metabolic and clearance status across a chosen sub window within the overall time period, such as proxies for glymphatic activity or accumulated waste markers.

4. Memory performance observable

   ```txt
   Mem_perf(m; task)
   ```

   * Output: effective performance metrics for specific learning and memory tasks that occur before and after sleep episodes within the window represented by `m`.

5. Cognitive and affective performance observable

   ```txt
   Cog_perf(m; domain)
   ```

   * Output: effective measures of attention, decision making, mood regulation, and related functions across one or more domains, summarised over the same time window.

These observables are assumed to be well defined and finite for all `m` in the regular subset of `M_sleep` considered below.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables and finite encoding libraries

We define three primary nonnegative mismatch quantities that measure how far a given configuration departs from an admissible low tension regime.

1. Architecture mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_arch(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures the deviation of `Arch_stage(m)` from an admissible reference class of architecture patterns that are hypothesised to be functionally adequate for the organism and context in question.

2. Memory mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_memory(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures the deviation between observed memory related outcomes encoded in `Mem_perf(m; task)` and a reference profile of outcomes that would be expected if sleep were performing an adequate consolidation and pruning function for the same tasks and exposures.

3. Metabolic mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_met(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Measures the deviation between metabolic and clearance indicators encoded in `Met_clear(m; window)` and a reference class of maintenance and clearance profiles associated with long term health.

To avoid non falsifiable definitions, we introduce finite encoding libraries:

```txt
Lib_arch   = {ArchEncoding_1, ArchEncoding_2, ..., ArchEncoding_Ka}
Lib_memory = {MemEncoding_1, MemEncoding_2, ..., MemEncoding_Km}
Lib_met    = {MetEncoding_1, MetEncoding_2, ..., MetEncoding_Kc}
```

Each element of these libraries is a concrete, finite specification of how to compute the corresponding mismatch from the relevant observables, including:

* choice of normalisation and rescaling,
* choice of reference classes,
* explicit functional forms.

Fairness constraints for experiments and analyses:

* For any given study or model evaluation, one element from each library is selected **in advance** of detailed outcome inspection.
* Once selected, these encodings must be held fixed for all subsequent analysis in that context.
* No adaptive retuning of reference classes or encodings is permitted as a function of the measured mismatches.

### 3.4 Combined sleep tension functional

We define a combined sleep tension functional:

```txt
DeltaS_sleep(m) = w_arch   * DeltaS_arch(m)
                  + w_memory * DeltaS_memory(m)
                  + w_met    * DeltaS_met(m)
```

with the following constraints:

* `w_arch`, `w_memory`, `w_met` are nonnegative real weights.

* The weights satisfy:

  ```txt
  w_arch + w_memory + w_met = 1
  0.2 <= w_arch   <= 0.6
  0.2 <= w_memory <= 0.6
  0.2 <= w_met    <= 0.6
  ```

* For a given analysis or application, one specific triplet `(w_arch, w_memory, w_met)` is chosen within this admissible set **before** any evaluation of `DeltaS_sleep` on real or simulated data.

This ensures that:

* `DeltaS_sleep(m) >= 0` for all `m` in the regular domain,
* `DeltaS_sleep(m)` cannot be made arbitrarily small by pathological weight choices that ignore one of the terms completely.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or not finite for certain configurations, either because of missing summaries or pathological data.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing_sleep = {
  m in M_sleep :
  DeltaS_arch(m), DeltaS_memory(m), or DeltaS_met(m)
  is undefined or not finite under the chosen encodings
}
```

and the regular domain:

```txt
M_sleep_reg = M_sleep \ S_sing_sleep
```

All statements about `DeltaS_sleep`, and all experiments described in this document, are restricted to `M_sleep_reg`. Whenever an experimental protocol would require evaluating `DeltaS_sleep(m)` for some `m` in `S_sing_sleep`, that configuration is treated as out of domain and excluded from tension based conclusions.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block describes how Q086 is characterised as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core sleep tension functional

The core effective functional is `DeltaS_sleep(m)` defined above. Intuitively, it captures a multi objective tension:

* architecture level mismatch (how far sleep timing and structure deviate from functionally adequate patterns),
* memory level mismatch (how far consolidation and pruning outcomes deviate from target profiles),
* metabolic level mismatch (how far clearance and maintenance deviate from healthy regimes).

For any `m` in `M_sleep_reg`:

```txt
DeltaS_sleep(m) = 0
```

would represent an idealised configuration where, under the chosen encodings and weights, the architecture, memory, and metabolic aspects are jointly in a normative band. In practice, we only expect `DeltaS_sleep(m)` to be small and stable for well regulated sleep patterns.

### 4.2 Sleep as constrained low tension regime

At the effective layer, the guiding principle for a view where sleep has a fundamental multi function role can be phrased as:

> For organisms with complex nervous systems, there exist families of sleep world configurations `m` in `M_sleep_reg` such that:
>
> * `DeltaS_sleep(m)` is kept in a low and relatively stable band across days under typical environmental conditions, and
> * attempts to remove or radically reshape sleep without adding additional mechanisms lead to persistent increases in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` that cannot be reduced back to the original low band.

More concretely, for a given species and context, there is a low tension band:

```txt
0 <= DeltaS_sleep(m) <= epsilon_sleep
```

and a set of sleep patterns with typical architecture for which world representing states `m` lie in this band. Chronic deviations of architecture outside a certain envelope push `DeltaS_sleep(m)` beyond `epsilon_sleep` in ways that are reflected in measurable cognitive and metabolic outcomes.

### 4.3 Competing view: sleep as substitutable or epiphenomenal

A competing effective layer view can be expressed as:

> For some organisms or contexts, there exist world representing configurations where sleep can be replaced, greatly reduced, or reshaped into qualitatively different patterns, while `DeltaS_sleep(m)` remains in a similarly low band.

In the formal language above, this would correspond to the existence of patterns with:

```txt
DeltaS_sleep(m_alt) <= epsilon_sleep
```

under alternative conditions such as:

* extremely short or fragmented sleep,
* pharmacologic or technological substitutes,
* states with little resemblance to canonical sleep architecture,

without adding extra compensating mechanisms that would themselves be costly or implausible.

Q086, at the effective layer, encodes the tension between these two pictures by specifying what counts as low versus high `DeltaS_sleep`, how it responds to perturbations, and how it scales across species and contexts.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer. They are framed in terms of observable patterns and `DeltaS_sleep(m)`, not in terms of internal TU generative rules.

* World T: sleep is functionally indispensable and multi functional.
* World F: sleep is largely substitutable or epiphenomenal.

### 5.1 World T (sleep as indispensable multi function maintenance)

In World T, for a given species and context:

1. Low tension region aligned with typical sleep

   * There exists a family of world representing states `m_T` in `M_sleep_reg` such that:

     * `Arch_stage(m_T)` falls within empirically observed ranges for total sleep time, stage proportions, and fragmentation.
     * `DeltaS_sleep(m_T)` lies below a small threshold `epsilon_sleep_T` that reflects good cognitive and metabolic outcomes.

2. Perturbation sensitivity

   * Chronic partial restriction, selective stage deprivation, or substitution by pharmacologic states that only mimic some markers systematically move the world into configurations where:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_sleep(m_T_pert) >= delta_sleep_T
     ```

     with `delta_sleep_T > epsilon_sleep_T`, for a substantial fraction of individuals and time windows.

3. Cross species and developmental coherence

   * Across species and developmental stages, when the environment and ecological niche are taken into account, empirically observed sleep architectures tend to cluster in regions of `Arch_stage(m)` where `DeltaS_sleep(m)` can be kept low without introducing implausible compensations elsewhere.

### 5.2 World F (sleep as substitutable or epiphenomenal)

In World F, the effective patterns are different:

1. Existence of low tension non sleep or altered patterns

   * There exist configurations `m_F` in `M_sleep_reg` where:

     * conventional sleep is minimal or absent, or sleep architecture is radically altered, and
     * `DeltaS_sleep(m_F)` remains below a threshold comparable to `epsilon_sleep_T` of World T.

2. Robustness of low tension under sleep manipulation

   * Perturbations that remove or strongly reshape sleep do not produce persistent increases in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` beyond transient adaptation phases, except possibly in extreme or pathological cases.

3. Weak cross species constraints

   * There exist stable lineages and ecological niches where species with little canonical sleep or highly irregular sleep patterns show no systematic increase in cognitive or metabolic mismatch, as measured by the observables used to define `DeltaS_sleep`.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are not meant to be exhaustive physical scenarios. They are tools for explaining how different empirical findings map to the sign and magnitude of changes in `DeltaS_sleep` under manipulation and across species. They do not assert or require any specific mechanisms at the level of TU generative rules.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q086 encoding,
* distinguish between different sleep tension models under the same data,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter and library choices.

All experiments are implicitly restricted to the regular domain `M_sleep_reg` defined in Section 3.5. Encoding choices in each experiment must come from the finite libraries in Section 3.3 and must respect the fairness constraints stated there.

These experiments cannot prove or disprove the fundamental function of sleep in a strict sense. They can falsify specific TU encodings for Q086.

### Experiment 1: Multi function impact of staged sleep restriction

**Goal**

Test whether keeping `Arch_stage(m)` within systematically restricted patterns produces sustained increases in `DeltaS_memory(m)` and `DeltaS_met(m)` that cannot be explained by time awake alone.

**Setup**

* Population: human or animal subjects with controlled environments.

* Arms:

  * normal sleep architecture,
  * chronic partial sleep restriction,
  * selective slow wave reduction,
  * selective REM reduction.

* Collected observables:

  * `Arch_stage(m)` summaries for each subject and period,
  * `Mem_perf(m; task)` for a set of memory tasks,
  * `Met_clear(m; window)` related markers,
  * sufficient metadata to control for total time awake and task exposure.

**Protocol**

1. Before the study, fix one encoding from each library in Section 3.3:

   ```txt
   ArchEncoding_k in Lib_arch
   MemEncoding_l  in Lib_memory
   MetEncoding_r  in Lib_met
   ```

   and a particular weight triplet `(w_arch, w_memory, w_met)` within the admissible range defined in Section 3.4.

2. For each subject and study period, construct an effective state `m` in `M_sleep_reg` that encodes the required observables (without specifying how the mapping is implemented).

3. Compute `DeltaS_arch(m)`, `DeltaS_memory(m)`, `DeltaS_met(m)` using the fixed encodings, and then `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.

4. Compare the distribution of `DeltaS_sleep(m)` across arms over time, controlling for total time awake and task exposure.

**Metrics**

* Arm wise distributions of `DeltaS_arch(m)` and `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.
* Changes in `DeltaS_memory(m)` and `DeltaS_met(m)` relative to baseline within each arm.
* Effect sizes comparing restricted and selective deprivation arms against normal sleep.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for the fixed encodings and weights chosen a priori, chronic partial restriction or selective stage deprivation does not produce any sustained increase in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` beyond a predefined tolerance band, even when cognitive and metabolic outcomes clearly diverge from normal sleep, then this particular encoding of `DeltaS_sleep` is considered falsified.
* If small changes in encodings within the finite libraries can reverse conclusions in arbitrary ways without clear justification, the chosen library design for Q086 is considered inadequate and must be revised.

**Semantics implementation note**

This experiment uses the hybrid interpretation indicated in Block 0: continuous time series and physiological quantities are summarised into continuous fields, while sleep stages and sequences are treated as discrete labels linked to those fields by fixed interface rules.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment can reject specific sleep tension encodings but does not by itself identify the fundamental function of sleep.

---

### Experiment 2: Natural sleep versus pharmacologic substitutes

**Goal**

Assess whether pharmacologic or technologically induced states that mimic some markers of sleep can substitute for natural sleep in keeping `DeltaS_sleep(m)` low.

**Setup**

* Population: subjects undergoing controlled interventions.

* Arms:

  * normal sleep,
  * sedation or pharmacologic states that show sleep like markers without full natural architecture,
  * device assisted rest states with limited movement but altered neural dynamics.

* Observables:

  * `Arch_stage(m)` including presence or absence of canonical stages,
  * `Dyn_osc(m; region, band)` summaries,
  * `Mem_perf(m; task)`,
  * `Met_clear(m; window)`,
  * `Cog_perf(m; domain)` for relevant tasks.

**Protocol**

1. Select encodings and weights as in Experiment 1, before examining comparative outcomes across arms.
2. For each subject and condition, generate states `m` in `M_sleep_reg` representing defined time windows under each arm.
3. Compute `DeltaS_arch(m)`, `DeltaS_memory(m)`, `DeltaS_met(m)`, and `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.
4. Compare tension profiles between natural sleep and substitute states over time.

**Metrics**

* Differences in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` between arms at matched time points.
* Longitudinal behaviour of `DeltaS_memory(m)` and `DeltaS_met(m)` under prolonged substitution.
* Correlations between `Dyn_osc(m; region, band)` patterns and tension measures.

**Falsification conditions**

* If substitute states can maintain `DeltaS_sleep(m)` within the same low band as natural sleep across long durations, while preserving cognitive and metabolic outcomes, then any encoding that predicts necessarily large tension increases under substitution is falsified.
* Conversely, if substitute states clearly fail to prevent increases in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` yet the encoding maps them to low tension, the encoding is misaligned with observable outcomes and must be rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**

The hybrid interpretation is again used: discrete labels for condition and stage are linked to continuous dynamical and metabolic summaries, without changing the core meaning of `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment tests whether particular encodings correctly differentiate natural sleep from its substitutes, not whether sleep has an irreplaceable function in an absolute sense.

---

### Experiment 3: Cross species scaling and ecological constraints

**Goal**

Examine whether species level sleep architecture and duration can be understood as near minima of `DeltaS_sleep(m)` under ecological and metabolic constraints.

**Setup**

* Data: comparative datasets for multiple species including:

  * average total sleep duration,
  * typical sleep staging patterns,
  * brain and body size,
  * metabolic rate,
  * life history traits,
  * basic cognitive and health outcomes.

* Observables:

  * species specific `Arch_stage(m)` summaries,
  * summarised `Mem_perf(m; task)` and `Met_clear(m; window)` indicators where available,
  * ecological and predation risk measures.

**Protocol**

1. Select encodings from libraries and weights as in previous experiments.
2. For each species and a canonical ecological niche, define representative states `m` in `M_sleep_reg` encapsulating typical patterns and outcomes.
3. Compute `DeltaS_arch(m)`, `DeltaS_memory(m)`, `DeltaS_met(m)`, and `DeltaS_sleep(m)` for these representative states.
4. Map species into a joint space of sleep parameters, ecological constraints, and `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `DeltaS_sleep(m)` across species after adjusting for known ecological and metabolic constraints.
* Presence or absence of clustering near low tension regions compatible with observed niche constraints.
* Identification of outlier species where sleep patterns appear to be far from low tension regimes.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding predicts that many species with apparently normal cognitive and health outcomes reside in high `DeltaS_sleep(m)` regions without clear compensatory mechanisms, the encoding is considered misaligned with cross species evidence.
* If the encoding cannot distinguish between obviously constrained and unconstrained sleep patterns when ecological and metabolic factors are controlled, it fails to provide meaningful tension structure and should be revised.

**Semantics implementation note**

Continuous traits such as body size and metabolic rate are treated as continuous fields, while species identity and niche are discrete labels linked through fixed rules to the interpretation of low versus high `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment only tests whether Q086 encodings yield a coherent cross species picture, not whether a single universal function of sleep exists.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q086 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used in AI models to encourage sleep aware and tension aware reasoning.

1. `signal_sleep_debt_tension`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_sleep(m)` in scenarios where narratives or data describe chronic sleep restriction, shift work, or similar patterns.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that treat chronic high sleep debt as neutral with respect to cognitive and metabolic outcomes.

2. `signal_arch_stability`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_arch(m)` that measures how close described sleep patterns are to normative architecture ranges under given constraints.
   * Purpose: enforce awareness of the difference between short term adjustments and long term stable regimes.

3. `signal_multi_obj_maintenance`

   * Definition: a composite signal that simultaneously monitors `DeltaS_memory(m)` and `DeltaS_met(m)` and penalises inconsistent combinations, such as claiming perfect cognition with clearly compromised metabolic maintenance.
   * Purpose: promote multi objective coherence in reasoning about sleep.

4. `signal_counterfactual_separation_sleep`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how clearly the model distinguishes World T style and World F style assumptions when prompts explicitly switch between them.
   * Purpose: reduce mixing of incompatible assumptions in a single explanation.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q086 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `SleepTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a scenario involving rest, work, and health, produce an estimate of `DeltaS_sleep(m)` as an auxiliary output.
   * Interface: inputs are contextual embeddings and structured features; outputs are:

     * a scalar `tension_value`,
     * optional decomposed terms corresponding to `DeltaS_arch(m)`, `DeltaS_memory(m)`, and `DeltaS_met(m)`.

2. `MaintenanceCyclePlanner`

   * Role: a planning module that simulates trade offs between work, rest, and recovery phases under resource and risk constraints.
   * Interface: inputs include current state, goals, and constraints; outputs include candidate schedules along with predicted changes in `DeltaS_sleep(m)` over time.

3. `SleepOutcomeFilter`

   * Role: a filter that checks narratives or policies involving extreme sleep manipulation against Q086 tension invariants.
   * Interface: inputs are candidate outputs; outputs are:

     * a score indicating whether the narrative is compatible with low or high `DeltaS_sleep(m)`,
     * optional flags for likely contradictions with empirical regularities.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q086 modules.

1. Task selection

   * Construct or collect tasks involving:

     * chronic partial sleep loss,
     * jet lag and shift work narratives,
     * pharmacologic or technological interventions affecting sleep,
     * developmental sleep disturbances.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the model operates without explicit Q086 specific modules or training signals.
   * TU enhanced condition: the model incorporates `SleepTensionHead`, `MaintenanceCyclePlanner`, and relevant training signals.

3. Metrics

   * Consistency: frequency with which the model gives mutually coherent predictions about cognitive and metabolic outcomes across related prompts.
   * Realism: degree to which predicted effects of sleep manipulation align with empirical findings as captured by the observables underlying `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.
   * Counterfactual separation: ability to maintain distinct reasoning threads for World T and World F style assumptions without conflating them.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the qualitative impact of Q086 encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain trade offs between working longer hours with little sleep versus maintaining regular sleep, in terms of performance, health, and long term risk, without mentioning any tension or TU language.
  * Observation: record whether answers are fragmented, overconfident, or neglect known long term costs.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: ask the same question but add an instruction to organise the explanation using:

    * architecture level patterns,
    * memory and learning effects,
    * metabolic and clearance considerations,

    and to describe how an internal multi objective tension indicator would behave across scenarios.

  * Observation: record whether the explanation becomes more structured, explicitly separates short term and long term effects, and explicitly recognises multi function roles of sleep.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a simple rubric to rate:

    * structural clarity,
    * coverage of cognitive and metabolic dimensions,
    * internal consistency across related prompts.

  * Compare ratings between baseline and TU encoded setups.

* What to log

  * Prompts and full responses for both setups.
  * Any auxiliary tension estimates produced by Q086 modules.

This allows external reviewers to inspect behaviour without exposing TU internal generative mechanisms.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q086 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `SleepArchitectureField`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: structured descriptors of sleep stage sequences, durations, fragmentation indices, and circadian alignment.
     * Output: a normalised representation suitable for computing `DeltaS_arch(m)` and related quantities.

   * Preconditions: inputs must represent one or more completed cycles for a given organism and context.

2. ComponentName: `SleepMultiFunctionTension`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: outputs of `SleepArchitectureField`, memory related summaries, and metabolic or clearance summaries compatible with `DeltaS_memory(m)` and `DeltaS_met(m)`.
     * Output: a scalar `DeltaS_sleep(m)` together with optional decomposed components.

   * Preconditions: inputs must come from consistent encodings selected from the finite libraries defined for Q086.

3. ComponentName: `MaintenanceCycleExperiment_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: specification of work rest patterns, manipulation types, and observables to be recorded.
     * Output: a protocol that defines subject allocation, measurement windows, and rules for computing tension quantities.

   * Preconditions: the specified manipulations must be ethically and practically implementable, and observables must be measurable in finite time.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q087 (BH_NEURO_NEURODEGEN_L3_087)

   * Reused component: `SleepArchitectureField` and `SleepMultiFunctionTension`.
   * Why it transfers: chronic high `DeltaS_sleep(m)` is a plausible risk factor or marker for neurodegeneration, so these components can be used to define exposure measures.
   * What changes: additional observables representing neurodegeneration markers are linked to tension history over longer timescales.

2. Q088 (BH_NEURO_DEV_CRIT_WINDOWS_L3_088)

   * Reused component: `MaintenanceCycleExperiment_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: developmental critical windows often involve specific patterns of sleep and wake cycles; the experiment template can be specialised to developmental cohorts.
   * What changes: tasks and observables are tailored to developmental outcomes rather than adult performance.

3. Q100 (BH_SOC_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)

   * Reused component: `SleepMultiFunctionTension`.
   * Why it transfers: population level vulnerability may depend partly on distributions of `DeltaS_sleep(m)` under crisis conditions, affecting immune function and decision making.
   * What changes: the functional is aggregated across individuals and time windows, and linked to epidemiological and behavioural models.

4. Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)

   * Reused component: `MaintenanceCycleExperiment_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: AI training regimes can be structured into work and maintenance phases analogous to sleep and wake; this template guides how to design and interpret such phases in terms of multi objective tension.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q086 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding for the fundamental function of sleep has been specified, including:

    * state space,
    * key observables and mismatch quantities,
    * a combined tension functional,
    * a singular set and domain restrictions.

  * At least one explicit experiment template with falsification conditions has been described.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative relating architecture, memory, metabolic maintenance, and multi objective tension is explicit and self consistent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds (World T and World F) are defined in terms of observable patterns rather than deep mechanisms.

These levels match the flags in the header metadata of Block 0.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be achieved:

1. Implementation of a prototype analysis pipeline that:

   * instantiates specific encodings from `Lib_arch`, `Lib_memory`, and `Lib_met`,
   * computes `DeltaS_sleep(m)` for real datasets under controlled scenarios,
   * publishes both procedures and anonymised tension summaries.

2. Execution of at least one partial version of Experiment 1 or Experiment 2, where:

   * the arm structure and observables are clearly defined,
   * encodings and weights are fixed before analysis,
   * the resulting tension profiles and falsification outcomes are documented.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer and do not require specifying how TU internal fields are generated from raw data.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU programme

In the long term, Q086 is expected to serve as:

* The central node for sleep related tension modelling, connecting hard problems in neuroscience with health, risk, and AI maintenance analogues.

* A template for encoding multi function biological processes with overlapping cognitive and thermodynamic roles, using:

  * finite encoding libraries,
  * explicit fairness constraints,
  * well defined singular sets.

* A benchmark for AI systems and analytical frameworks that must reason about complex trade offs between short term gains from reducing sleep and long term costs expressed through `DeltaS_sleep(m)`.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non experts, while remaining aligned with the effective layer description.

Many animals, including humans, spend a large part of their lives asleep. While they sleep, they:

* cannot search for food,
* cannot actively avoid danger,
* still use energy to keep the brain and body running.

So the puzzle is simple to state:

> If sleep is so costly and risky, why did evolution keep it?
> What does sleep do that is so important that it is worth those costs?

In this document, we do not try to answer that question with one magic sentence. Instead, we do three more modest things.

1. We describe the kinds of things that clearly change with sleep:

   * how the night is structured into different stages,
   * how well people remember things they learned,
   * how well their bodies clear waste and recover,
   * how stable their mood and attention are.

2. We define a single number, called `DeltaS_sleep(m)`, that tells us how out of balance a given situation is with respect to what looks like healthy sleep:

   * if this number is small, sleep architecture, memory, and body maintenance all look reasonably good,
   * if this number is large, at least one of these parts seems to be under strain.

3. We ask what happens to this number when we change sleep in different ways:

   * reduce sleep a little every night,
   * remove certain stages,
   * try to replace sleep with drugs or devices,
   * look across different animal species and lifestyles.

If we live in a world where sleep has a truly fundamental multi function role, we expect to see patterns like this:

* When sleep is roughly normal, `DeltaS_sleep(m)` stays small and stable.
* When sleep is cut short or strongly reshaped, `DeltaS_sleep(m)` goes up and stays high, and people or animals do worse on thinking tasks, health, or long term outcomes.
* Across species, typical sleep patterns line up with regions where `DeltaS_sleep(m)` can be kept low, given each species lifestyle and environment.

If instead sleep were easy to replace, we would expect to find situations where:

* people or animals can sleep very little, or sleep in strange ways,
* yet `DeltaS_sleep(m)` stays low and their thinking and health remain fine,
* without paying extra costs somewhere else.

We do not claim here which world is the real one. Instead, Q086 gives:

* a clear way to describe data about sleep,
* a way to summarise how well different sleep patterns work using `DeltaS_sleep(m)`,
* specific experiments that can show whether a given way of measuring this is reasonable or not.

This is what it means, in the Tension Universe programme, to treat the fundamental function of sleep as an S level problem. We build a careful effective description and tension structure first, then any stronger claims about what sleep really is at a deeper level must be argued separately, using these definitions as constraints rather than shortcuts.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.
* Any engineering suggestions in Sections 7 and 8 are proposals for tools and benchmarks, not guarantees of performance in safety critical applications.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live inside the effective layer of the TU framework.
* They are one candidate family of encodings compatible with current evidence; they are not asserted to be unique, final, or literally realised in biology or physics.
* No claim is made that `DeltaS_sleep(m)` or any other tension functional corresponds to a directly measurable quantity without additional modelling assumptions.
* When this page is used in empirical or AI work, all mappings from raw data into the objects defined here must be documented separately and can themselves be tested or falsified.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These charters define global constraints on how effective layer objects are introduced, how encoding families and weights are selected, and how tension scales are compared across problems.
