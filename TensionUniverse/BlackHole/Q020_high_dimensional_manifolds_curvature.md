## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The classical objects in this problem are:

- Smooth connected manifolds `X` of dimension `n` with `n >= 5`.
- Riemannian metrics `g` on `X`.
- Curvature constraints imposed on `(X, g)` such as:
  - bounds on sectional curvature,
  - bounds on Ricci curvature,
  - bounds on scalar curvature,
  - or combinations of these.

At a high level, the canonical problem for Q020 asks:

> For fixed dimension `n >= 5` and a fixed curvature constraint class `C`, is there a finite or effectively finite description of all complete Riemannian manifolds `(X, g)` that satisfy `C`, up to an appropriate equivalence such as diffeomorphism or isometry?

More concretely, one can phrase Q020 as the family of questions:

1. Given `n >= 5` and a curvature condition `C` (for example nonnegative sectional curvature, positive Ricci curvature, or two sided sectional curvature bounds), does there exist:
   - a finite library of canonical model spaces, and
   - a finite list of controlled operations (for example products, quotients, surgeries under curvature control),
   such that every `(X, g)` satisfying `C` is obtained from these models by these operations, up to diffeomorphism or isometry?

2. If not finite in a strict sense, is there at least a classification up to finitely many parameters in an effective and structurally transparent way?

Q020 in this BlackHole setting does not commit to a specific formalization of “finite classification”. Instead, it encodes the tension between:

- local geometric constraints given by curvature,
- global topological and geometric complexity,
- the possibility of capturing all such manifolds using a small library of canonical types.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Some related lower dimensional cases are well understood:

- In dimension 2, complete classification of Riemannian manifolds with curvature constraints is classical, with strong links to topology through Gauss curvature.
- In dimension 3, the combination of Thurston’s geometrization program and Ricci flow techniques has provided powerful classification results under various curvature and topological assumptions.

In higher dimensions (`n >= 5`), the situation is much more incomplete:

- There are strong structure theorems under certain curvature conditions, for example splitting theorems, almost flat manifold results, and restrictions on possible fundamental groups.
- For many curvature classes (for example nonnegative sectional curvature or positive scalar curvature), there are numerous known examples and families, but no complete classification.
- In several settings it is unknown whether there are infinitely many distinct diffeomorphism types of manifolds satisfying the same curvature bounds.
- Interactions between curvature conditions and topological invariants (for example characteristic classes, fundamental group growth, exotic smooth structures) are only partially understood.

As a result, Q020 remains an umbrella for multiple difficult open problems in high dimensional Riemannian geometry and global analysis, with no single known resolution.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q020 plays the following roles:

1. It is the primary node for **high dimensional curvature constrained classification**, capturing the tension between local differential inequalities and global manifold type.
2. It provides a geometric analogue of classification style questions that appear in physics and AI, by asking whether a finite library can describe all admissible objects under strict constraints.
3. It supplies reusable components for:
   - geometric flow problems (Q017),
   - quantum gravity background selection (Q021),
   - black hole spacetime modelling (Q040),
   - and other nodes that require controlled high dimensional geometry.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q020 sits inside the BlackHole graph. Each edge has a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

- state spaces,
- observables and fields,
- invariants and tension scores,
- singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden TU generative rules or any mapping from raw geometric data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We fix:

- an integer `n >= 5`,
- and a curvature constraint class `C` (for example “complete `n` dimensional manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature and bounded diameter”).

We define the state space:

```txt
M_geo
```

with the following interpretation:

- Each element `m` in `M_geo` represents an equivalence class of configurations consisting of:
  - a smooth connected `n` dimensional manifold `X_m`,
  - a Riemannian metric `g_m` on `X_m` that satisfies the curvature constraint class `C`,
  - a finite collection of coarse summaries derived from `(X_m, g_m)` that will serve as observables.

The effective layer assumptions are:

- For every geometrically admissible configuration `(X, g)` in the class `C`, there exist states `m` in `M_geo` that encode the observable summaries needed below.
- We do not specify how `X_m`, `g_m`, or the observables are constructed from raw data. We only assume that they are well defined and give consistent values for all observables listed.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We introduce a fixed finite set of sample scales and a finite library of canonical models.

1. Sample scales

   - Choose a finite list of radii:

     ```txt
     R_sample = {r_1, ..., r_K}
     ```

     with `0 < r_1 < ... < r_K`, all within a scale range where curvature bounds make sense.

2. Canonical model library

   - Choose a finite library of canonical curvature constrained model types:

     ```txt
     L_curv = {L_1, ..., L_N}
     ```

     where each `L_k` is a model template (for example a standard sphere of radius 1, a product of spaces, or a homogeneous space) that itself satisfies class `C`.
   - This library is fixed once for Q020 at the effective layer and is not allowed to change per state.

On this basis, we define the following observables for each state `m` in `M_geo`:

1. Local curvature profile observable

   ```txt
   K_loc(m; r_j)
   ```

   - For each radius `r_j` in `R_sample`, this observable is a finite dimensional vector summarizing curvature statistics of `(X_m, g_m)` on a representative family of metric balls of radius `r_j`.
   - We only assume that for each `r_j`, `K_loc(m; r_j)` is well defined and finite.

2. Global topology observable

   ```txt
   Topo(m)
   ```

   - A finite dimensional vector summarizing:
     - selected Betti numbers of `X_m` in a fixed range of degrees,
     - coarse information about the fundamental group class,
     - possibly growth properties like volume growth rate.
   - We assume `Topo(m)` is well defined and finite for all `m` that satisfy class `C`.

3. Volume growth and diameter observables

   ```txt
   VolGrowth(m; r_j)
   Diam(m)
   ```

   - `VolGrowth(m; r_j)` summarizes volume of metric balls of radius `r_j` in `(X_m, g_m)`, averaged in a suitable way.
   - `Diam(m)` is an effective approximation to the diameter of `(X_m, g_m)` when defined, or a proxy for diameter scale in the non compact case.

4. Library projection observables

   For each library element `L_k` we define:

   ```txt
   Lib_score(m; L_k)
   ```

   - A scalar in a fixed range, for example `[0, 1]`, that indicates how close the observable summaries of `m` are to those of the canonical model `L_k`.
   - `Lib_score(m; L_k) = 1` is interpreted as “perfect match” at the level of these summaries.

We do not specify how these observables are computed from `(X_m, g_m)`. We only assume they are consistent with the curvature constraints and with each other for all states outside the singular set defined below.

### 3.3 Tension observables and mismatch functionals

We define three mismatch observables and one combined geometric tension score.

1. Curvature constraint mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_curv(m) >= 0
   ```

   - Measures how close the local curvature profiles `K_loc(m; r_j)` and volume growth profiles are to the patterns allowed by the constraint class `C`.
   - `DeltaS_curv(m) = 0` if all `K_loc(m; r_j)` and `VolGrowth(m; r_j)` fall within known or conjectured bands for class `C`.

2. Topology geometry mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_topo(m) >= 0
   ```

   - Measures how compatible `Topo(m)` is with the curvature constraint class `C` according to known theorems and conjectures.
   - `DeltaS_topo(m) = 0` when `Topo(m)` lies entirely inside the set of topological patterns that are known or conjectured to be realizable under class `C`.

3. Library classification mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_lib(m) >= 0
   ```

   - Uses `Lib_score(m; L_k)` across all `k` to measure how well `(X_m, g_m)` can be approximated by the finite library `L_curv`.
   - `DeltaS_lib(m) = 0` if there exists at least one `L_k` such that `Lib_score(m; L_k)` is at its maximal value.

4. Combined geometric tension functional

   We fix once and for all three positive weights:

   ```txt
   a_curv > 0
   a_topo > 0
   a_lib  > 0
   a_curv + a_topo + a_lib = 1
   ```

   These weights are chosen at the encoding level for Q020 and are not allowed to depend on the individual state `m`.

   We then define:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_geo(m) = a_curv * DeltaS_curv(m)
                 + a_topo * DeltaS_topo(m)
                 + a_lib  * DeltaS_lib(m)
   ```

   which is a nonnegative scalar for every admissible state `m`.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor and singular set

We define an effective tension tensor on `M_geo` consistent with the TU core pattern:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_geo(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_geo
```

where:

- `S_i(m)` are source like factors describing how strongly geometric information in `m` feeds into the i-th logical or physical component.
- `C_j(m)` are receptivity like factors describing how sensitive the j-th component is to geometric inconsistencies.
- `DeltaS_geo(m)` is the combined geometric tension score from above.
- `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor with values in a fixed bounded interval.
- `kappa_geo` is a fixed coupling constant that sets the overall scale for geometric consistency_tension.

We now define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M_geo :
           any of K_loc, Topo, VolGrowth, Diam, Lib_score,
           DeltaS_curv, DeltaS_topo, DeltaS_lib is undefined or inconsistent }
```

and the regular domain:

```txt
M_geo_reg = M_geo \ S_sing
```

Domain restriction rule:

- All evaluations of `DeltaS_geo(m)` and `T_ij(m)` in Q020 are only defined for `m` in `M_geo_reg`.
- If an experiment or protocol encounters a state in `S_sing`, the outcome is flagged as “out of domain” and is not interpreted as evidence for or against any classification hypothesis.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q020 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core geometric tension principle

At the effective layer, Q020 is expressed in terms of the behavior of the combined geometric tension `DeltaS_geo(m)` across all states in `M_geo_reg`.

We consider:

- a fixed dimension `n >= 5`,
- a fixed curvature constraint class `C`,
- a fixed finite canonical library `L_curv`,
- fixed weights `a_curv`, `a_topo`, `a_lib` as in Block 3.

The central tension principle is:

> Is it possible to choose a finite library `L_curv` and weights that are fixed in advance, such that for all geometrically realizable states `m` in `M_geo_reg` representing manifolds in class `C`, the geometric tension `DeltaS_geo(m)` remains confined to a small band for some controlled notion of approximation?

If yes, then the curvature constrained manifolds behave as if they admit a finite or effectively finite classification. If no, they behave as if any finite library is intrinsically unable to capture their complexity.

### 4.2 Low tension world (finite classification compatible)

We define the low tension principle:

- There exist constants `epsilon_geo > 0` and a function `epsilon_refine(k)` that decreases with a refinement parameter `k` (for example resolution of observables or size of sample sets), and:
- There exists a fixed library `L_curv` and fixed weights such that:

```txt
for every realizable state m in M_geo_reg
there exists some refinement level k
with DeltaS_geo(m_refined(k)) <= epsilon_refine(k)
```

where `m_refined(k)` denotes a refined version of `m` at higher resolution within the same encoding class.

In words:

- Under refinement that respects the curvature constraints and topological consistency, every physically relevant manifold can be well approximated by the finite library with small geometric tension.

### 4.3 High tension world (wild classification)

We define the high tension principle as the negation of the above in a robust sense:

- For any fixed library `L_curv` and fixed weights that respect the constraints of Block 3, there exist realizable states in `M_geo_reg` such that:

```txt
DeltaS_geo(m) >= delta_geo
```

for some `delta_geo > 0` that cannot be reduced below a positive threshold by any refinement of the observables within the admissible encoding class.

In words:

- There are genuinely new geometric types in class `C` that remain far from the chosen finite library in terms of geometric tension, no matter how one refines the observable summaries.

Q020 in the BlackHole context is therefore the question of whether our universe of curvature constrained high dimensional manifolds behaves more like a low tension finite classification world or a high tension wild classification world, under a fair encoding that does not tune parameters per instance.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds strictly at the effective layer:

- World T: finite library classification world.
- World F: intrinsically wild world.

These are patterns of observables and tension scores, not explicit constructions of manifolds or flows.

### 5.1 World T (finite library world, low geometric tension)

In World T:

1. Library adequacy at all scales

   - There exists a fixed finite library `L_curv` such that for any state `m` in `M_geo_reg`, there is a refinement level `k` with:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_geo(m_refined(k)) <= epsilon_refine(k)
     ```

     and `epsilon_refine(k)` tends to 0 with increasing `k`.

2. Flow toward canonical patterns

   - Geometric flows such as Ricci flow, when applied to realizable states in `M_geo_reg`, move the observable summaries of `(X_m, g_m)` closer to some member of `L_curv`, with geometric tension decreasing along flow trajectories except at controlled singular times.

3. Coherent topology geometry alignment

   - The topology observable `Topo(m)` for all realizable states remains inside the set predicted by curvature constraints together with the library patterns, leading to systematically small `DeltaS_topo(m)`.

4. Stable maximal tension bound

   - There exists a uniform bound `T_max` such that:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_geo(m) <= T_max
     ```

     for all realizable states in `M_geo_reg`, even before refinement.

### 5.2 World F (wild world, persistent high geometric tension)

In World F:

1. Library incompleteness

   - For any finite library `L_curv` chosen in advance and any allowed weights, there exist realizable states `m` in `M_geo_reg` such that:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_lib(m) >= delta_lib
     ```

     where `delta_lib` is a positive constant independent of refinements.

2. Flow complexity and new patterns

   - Geometric flows from some initial states exhibit behavior that cannot be approximated by any member of the current library, even after resolving singularities, yielding persistent high `DeltaS_curv(m)` and `DeltaS_geo(m)`.

3. Topology curvature tension

   - There exist families of manifolds satisfying curvature constraints where `Topo(m)` takes values outside the region predicted by any finite set of library patterns, leading to:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_topo(m) >= delta_topo
     ```

     for some positive `delta_topo`.

4. Unbounded tension tails

   - For any pre chosen tolerance band, there exist realizable states with geometric tension above that band, indicating that no finite classification can confine all curvature constrained manifolds to low tension.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are not claims about the actual truth of any specific classification conjecture. They are devices that:

- organize the types of geometric behavior in terms of observables and tension scores,
- allow us to test whether a given encoding behaves more like World T or World F for sets of examples,
- ensure that Q020 remains at the effective layer without revealing any deep TU generative mechanism.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

- test the coherence of the Q020 encoding,
- distinguish between different geometric tension models,
- provide evidence for or against particular library and parameter choices.

These experiments do not solve Q020. They can only falsify or support specific TU encodings related to Q020.

### Experiment 1: Library fit across known examples

*Goal:*

Test whether a chosen finite library `L_curv` and the combined tension score `DeltaS_geo` can simultaneously keep tension low on a broad set of known high dimensional curvature constrained manifolds without per instance tuning.

*Setup:*

- Select a set `E_known` of known examples of high dimensional manifolds with curvature constraints in class `C`, such as:
  - products of spheres and tori with controlled curvature,
  - symmetric spaces and homogeneous spaces with known curvature bounds,
  - examples constructed in the literature by gluing or surgery under curvature control.
- For each example, define a state `m` in `M_geo_reg` that encodes observables `K_loc`, `Topo`, `VolGrowth`, `Diam`, and `Lib_score`.

*Protocol:*

1. Fix once and for all:
   - the finite library `L_curv`,
   - the weights `a_curv`, `a_topo`, `a_lib`,
   - and a target low tension threshold `tau_low > 0`.
2. For each `m` in `E_known`, compute:
   - `DeltaS_curv(m)`,
   - `DeltaS_topo(m)`,
   - `DeltaS_lib(m)`,
   - and `DeltaS_geo(m)` from the formulas in Block 3.
3. Record the proportion of examples with `DeltaS_geo(m) <= tau_low` and the maximum observed tension.

*Metrics:*

- `p_low = (number of examples with DeltaS_geo(m) <= tau_low) / (size of E_known)`.
- `DeltaS_geo_max = max over m in E_known of DeltaS_geo(m)`.
- Sensitivity of these metrics to modest changes in the observable summaries within their error margins.

*Falsification conditions:*

- Define a target proportion `p_target` in `(0, 1]` and a maximum acceptable tension bound `T_target`.
- The encoding is considered falsified for this library and weight choice if:

  ```txt
  p_low < p_target  or  DeltaS_geo_max > T_target
  ```

  even after checking that observable summaries are within reasonable error margins.
- The encoding is also considered falsified if achieving `p_low >= p_target` or `DeltaS_geo_max <= T_target` requires retuning `L_curv` or the weights separately for different subsets of `E_known`.

*Semantics implementation note:*

All observables and tension scores in this experiment are interpreted in the continuous field sense recorded in the metadata. No discrete or hybrid reinterpretation is applied.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying TU encoding != solving canonical statement. This experiment can reject particular choices of library and tension functional but does not resolve whether a true finite classification exists.

---

### Experiment 2: Flow based separation of simple and complex geometries

*Goal:*

Check whether the geometric tension `DeltaS_geo` can distinguish between manifolds whose curvature evolves toward simple canonical patterns and those that exhibit complex or persistent singular behavior under geometric flows.

*Setup:*

- Select families of initial states in `M_geo_reg` corresponding to:
  - manifolds whose metrics are known or conjectured to evolve under a geometric flow (for example normalized Ricci flow) toward simple standard models,
  - manifolds whose metrics are known or conjectured to produce complex singular behavior or non trivial limit spaces.
- For each initial state, consider a sequence of effective states along the flow, denoted by `m(t_k)` for times `t_k` in an increasing sequence.

*Protocol:*

1. Fix the same library `L_curv` and weights `a_curv`, `a_topo`, `a_lib` as in Experiment 1.
2. For each flow trajectory, compute `DeltaS_geo(m(t_k))` at each sampled time.
3. Group trajectories into:
   - `Group_simple`: those with flow behavior approaching canonical models,
   - `Group_complex`: those with flow behavior showing complex singular patterns.
4. Compare the evolution of `DeltaS_geo` between the two groups.

*Metrics:*

- For each trajectory, define:
  - `DeltaS_geo_min = min over k of DeltaS_geo(m(t_k))`,
  - `DeltaS_geo_final` as the tension at the latest sampled time.
- Compare distributions of `DeltaS_geo_min` and `DeltaS_geo_final` between `Group_simple` and `Group_complex`.

*Falsification conditions:*

- Choose thresholds `tau_simple` and `tau_complex` with `tau_simple < tau_complex`.
- The encoding is considered ineffective and rejected for Q020 if:
  - for a large fraction of trajectories in `Group_simple`, `DeltaS_geo_min` fails to fall below `tau_simple`, or
  - for a large fraction of trajectories in `Group_complex`, `DeltaS_geo_final` is not significantly above `tau_simple`, or
  - the distributions of `DeltaS_geo` for `Group_simple` and `Group_complex` cannot be statistically separated under any reasonable threshold choices.
- The encoding is also rejected if small, non structural changes in observables lead to arbitrarily large changes in `DeltaS_geo` along flows without clear geometric reasons.

*Semantics implementation note:*

Flow time is treated as an additional parameter on continuous geometric fields, and all tension evaluations respect the continuous field interpretation from the metadata.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying TU encoding != solving canonical statement. This experiment probes whether the chosen encoding can meaningfully track geometric simplification and complexity but does not settle any classification conjecture.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q020 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be plugged into AI models to support geometry aware reasoning.

1. `signal_curvature_consistency`

   - Definition: a nonnegative signal proportional to `DeltaS_curv(m)` for states representing geometric contexts.
   - Purpose: penalize internal representations that imply geometric configurations violating chosen curvature constraints.

2. `signal_topo_geometric_alignment`

   - Definition: a nonnegative signal proportional to `DeltaS_topo(m)`.
   - Purpose: encourage consistency between stated topological properties and curvature related constraints.

3. `signal_library_fit`

   - Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_lib(m)`, for example mapping low mismatch to higher scores.
   - Purpose: guide the model to think in terms of finite libraries of canonical geometries when that is an appropriate abstraction.

4. `signal_geometric_tension_score`

   - Definition: directly equal to `DeltaS_geo(m)` for selected states `m`.
   - Purpose: serve as a scalar tension indicator that can be minimized in tasks where finite classification assumptions are part of the context.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q020 structures without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `GeomTensionHead`

   - Role: given an internal embedding of a mathematical or physical context involving manifolds and curvature, outputs an estimate of `DeltaS_geo(m)` and its components.
   - Interface:
     - Input: internal vector representation of the context.
     - Output: approximate values for `DeltaS_curv`, `DeltaS_topo`, `DeltaS_lib`, and `DeltaS_geo`.

2. `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor`

   - Role: an observer module that extracts low dimensional features corresponding to `K_loc`, `Topo`, `VolGrowth`, and `Diam` from internal representations.
   - Interface:
     - Input: internal embeddings.
     - Output: a fixed length feature vector summarizing curvature and topology style information.

3. `FiniteGeomLibraryClassifier`

   - Role: a classifier that maps the descriptors from `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor` to approximate membership scores for the finite library `L_curv`.
   - Interface:
     - Input: curvature topology feature vector.
     - Output: `Lib_score(m; L_k)` for each `L_k` and a summary mismatch estimate.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q020 modules.

1. Task selection

   - Construct question sets where models must:
     - assess whether two described manifolds are likely to belong to the same geometric class under given curvature constraints,
     - judge the plausibility of proposed classification statements,
     - reason about consequences of adding or removing curvature assumptions.

2. Conditions

   - Baseline condition:
     - The model answers these questions using standard reasoning without explicit geometric tension modules.
   - TU enhanced condition:
     - The model also uses `GeomTensionHead` and `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor` as auxiliary modules, with training signals derived from Q020 observables.

3. Metrics

   - Accuracy on structured geometry questions.
   - Consistency of answers when similar questions are asked with slightly different phrasings.
   - Ability to identify when a proposed manifold example seems incompatible with the stated curvature constraints.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A simple protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q020 encoding.

- Baseline setup:

  - Prompt: ask the AI to explain how curvature constraints in high dimensions can restrict possible manifold shapes and whether a finite classification is plausible.
  - Observation: note whether the explanation is vague, mixes incompatible examples, or fails to distinguish local and global issues.

- TU encoded setup:

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q020 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `GeometricTensionScore_Q020`

   - Type: functional
   - Minimal interface:
     - Inputs: `curvature_topology_features` summarizing `K_loc`, `Topo`, `VolGrowth`, `Diam`, and library scores.
     - Output: `tension_value` equal to `DeltaS_geo(m)` for the encoded state.
   - Preconditions:
     - Features must correspond to a state in `M_geo_reg`, with all observables well defined.

2. ComponentName: `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor`

   - Type: field
   - Minimal interface:
     - Inputs: state representation or internal embedding for a geometric context.
     - Output: fixed length feature vector capturing balanced curvature and topology information suitable for classification.

3. ComponentName: `FiniteGeomLibrary_Template`

   - Type: experiment_pattern
   - Minimal interface:
     - Inputs: a library size bound, a curvature constraint class `C`, and a family of example states.
     - Output: a protocol that:
       - selects a candidate finite library `L_curv`,
       - defines `Lib_score` and `DeltaS_lib`,
       - and evaluates classification tension across the examples.
   - Preconditions:
     - Example states must be in `M_geo_reg` and represent valid curvature constrained manifolds.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q017 (geometric flows)

   - Reused components: `GeometricTensionScore_Q020`, `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor`.
   - Why it transfers: Q017 studies flow behavior of metrics, and Q020 provides a ready made way to measure whether flows move manifolds toward low tension canonical types.
   - What changes: the time parameter along flows becomes part of the input features, and experiments focus on trajectories rather than static manifolds.

2. Q021 (quantum gravity spacetime selection)

   - Reused components: `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor`, `FiniteGeomLibrary_Template`.
   - Why it transfers: many spacetime models are built on high dimensional manifolds with curvature constraints, and Q020’s template can restrict candidate geometries to manageable sets.
   - What changes: the observables are enriched by physical quantities such as energy conditions, but geometric tension remains a core component.

3. Q040 (black hole information)

   - Reused components: `GeometricTensionScore_Q020`.
   - Why it transfers: candidate black hole spacetimes can be evaluated on whether their global geometry under curvature and topological constraints fits into a finite library of “information carrying geometries”.
   - What changes: additional observables corresponding to horizons and causal structure are attached to the descriptors.

4. Q123 (AI representation manifolds)

   - Reused components: `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor`, `FiniteGeomLibrary_Template`.
   - Why it transfers: internal AI representation spaces can be treated as abstract manifolds, and Q020 offers a way to ask whether their shapes fall into a finite set of canonical geometries.
   - What changes: curvature and topology observables become representation theoretic features rather than physical or mathematical curvature data.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q020 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

- E_level: E1

  - A coherent effective layer encoding of Q020 has been specified.
  - Observables, mismatch functionals, and a combined geometric tension score are defined.
  - At least two explicit experiment patterns with falsification conditions have been described.

- N_level: N1

  - A narrative exists that links curvature constraints, global topology, and finite library classification in terms of geometric tension.
  - Counterfactual worlds (finite library versus wild) are clearly distinguished at the level of observables.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be realized in practice:

1. Implement a prototype that:
   - encodes a nontrivial set of high dimensional curvature constrained manifolds as states in `M_geo_reg`,
   - computes approximate `CurvatureTopologyDescriptor` features,
   - and evaluates `DeltaS_geo(m)` for these examples, publishing the resulting tension profiles.

2. Instantiate the `FiniteGeomLibrary_Template` with:
   - a concrete curvature constraint class (for example nonnegative sectional curvature in specific dimensions),
   - a specific finite library `L_curv`,
   - and a well documented set of examples from the literature,
   and perform Experiment 1 to test whether the chosen library achieves acceptable tension metrics.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer and do not require revealing any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q020 is expected to:

- serve as the central node for high dimensional geometric classification problems under curvature constraints,
- provide a template for how TU handles classification tension in other domains (for example complex state spaces in physics and AI),
- and act as a bridge between rigorous geometric analysis and effective tension based reasoning in AI systems.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non specialists while remaining aligned with the effective layer description.

When people talk about “curvature” in geometry, they often imagine:

- surfaces that bend, like spheres, saddles, or flat planes,
- and the way this bending constrains what the space can look like overall.

In high dimensions, manifolds can be very complicated, but they still have curvature. Q020 asks:

> If we impose strong curvature rules on a high dimensional space, does that force the space into a small number of basic shapes, or can there still be endlessly many different shapes that obey the same curvature rules?

In the Tension Universe view:

- Each “shape” is represented by a state `m` that summarizes:
  - how curved the space is at different scales,
  - what its overall topology looks like (for example holes and connectedness),
  - how similar it is to a small set of standard spaces (a finite library).

We then define:

- numbers that measure how much the shape breaks curvature rules,
- numbers that measure how its topology fits known curvature constraints,
- and a score that measures how far it is from the finite library.

All of these are combined into a single geometric tension score `DeltaS_geo(m)`.

Two extreme possibilities emerge:

- In a finite classification world:
  - every allowed shape can, after looking at it in enough detail, be well approximated by one of the library models,
  - the geometric tension can always be made small by refining how we look at the shape.
- In a wild world:
  - no matter how we choose a finite library, there are always shapes whose tension stays large,
  - new kinds of shapes keep appearing that do not fit into a small list of patterns.

Q020 does not claim to solve this question. Instead, it:

- formalizes the problem at the level of observable summaries and tension scores,
- suggests experiments for testing how well any proposed finite library works on known examples and model flows,
- and offers reusable tools that can be plugged into AI systems that need to reason carefully about geometry.

In this way, Q020 functions as the geometric counterpart to other BlackHole problems: it tests whether “local rules plus a small catalog” can explain the global structure of complicated high dimensional spaces, or whether the universe of such spaces is intrinsically more wild.
