## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This document restates and structures a canonical scientific problem and proposes an effective-layer encoding in terms of state spaces, observables, invariants, and tension scores.
* It does not attempt to prove or disprove any theorem about the ultimate nature of the chemical bond in strongly correlated systems, nor does it claim the existence or uniqueness of a unified bond concept.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding scientific problem has been solved, either in a mathematical or physical sense.

Regarding TU itself:

* This entry does not define or expose any TU deep-layer axiom system, generative mechanism, or internal construction that maps raw experimental or computational data to TU fields.
* It only assumes that external many-body methods or experiments can provide summaries that are compatible with the effective state space and observables defined here.
* All mappings from raw data or wavefunctions to the state space and observables of Q061 are treated as external to TU and are not described in this file.

All claims about falsification or validation are about specific effective-layer encodings and tension functionals, not about the ultimate truth of any physical or chemical theory.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

In standard chemistry, a chemical bond is often treated as a localized interaction between atoms that

* stabilizes a particular arrangement of nuclei,
* can be described using relatively simple electronic structures,
* supports transferable concepts such as bond order and bond type.

In many systems, especially those dominated by a single Slater determinant or weak correlation, different theoretical pictures of bonding (molecular orbital, valence bond, simple Lewis structures) largely agree on

* which atoms are bonded,
* approximate bond orders,
* qualitative trends in bond strengths.

In strongly correlated electron systems, this picture fails or becomes ambiguous. Examples include

* Mott insulators and charge transfer salts,
* transition metal and f element complexes with near degenerate d or f shells,
* systems near metal insulator transitions,
* materials where unconventional superconductivity or magnetism emerges from strong local interactions.

The canonical question for Q061 is:

> Is there an effective and unified notion of a chemical bond in strongly correlated systems that
>
> * remains coherent across different theoretical languages of bonding,
> * is robust under changes in correlation strength and environment,
> * and can be expressed as a well defined object at the effective layer?

Q061 does not ask for a single conventional closed form formula for the bond. It asks whether, under reasonable encoding constraints, the concept of a chemical bond in strongly correlated systems can be made low tension and portable, or whether it is intrinsically representation dependent and fragmentary.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

From the chemistry and condensed matter literature:

* Classic bonding concepts were developed mainly for weakly correlated situations. They work well for small molecules and many organic and main group systems.
* Strongly correlated materials exhibit features such as

  * large static correlation,
  * strong competition between localization and delocalization,
  * emergent collective phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity.

In such systems

* simple molecular orbital pictures can mislead,
* valence bond pictures may require many resonance structures,
* different methods may disagree on whether a bond exists at all between specific atoms.

There is no consensus on a unified, general definition of chemical bond that

* is precise enough for many body quantum calculations,
* still matches chemists intuitive language,
* and remains stable in the strongly correlated regime.

The problem is conceptual and structural rather than a single theorem. It is difficult because it sits at the intersection of

* quantum many body physics,
* chemical intuition,
* materials science,
* and the philosophy of scientific concepts.

In the metadata, `Status: Reframed_only` means that this entry

* provides an effective-layer reframing and structuring of the problem,
* defines state spaces, observables, invariants, and tension functionals,
* specifies falsifiable encoding classes and experiments,

but does not make any theorem level claim about the existence, uniqueness, or non existence of a unified bond concept in strongly correlated systems.

Q061 is therefore classified as

* a reframing and structuring problem rather than a conventional theorem,
* at S rank difficulty due to its breadth and the depth of quantum correlation involved.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q061 plays several roles:

1. It is the anchor node for strongly correlated bonding problems, where local chemical language and global many body physics must be reconciled.

2. It serves as a test case for how Tension Universe encodings handle

   * multiple, competing conceptual languages (molecular orbital like, valence bond like, entanglement based),
   * strongly correlated quantum states,
   * and emergent phases such as metallic versus insulating behavior in one unified effective-layer framework.

3. It provides a bridge between

   * Q030 type quantum phase problems,
   * Q036 type high temperature superconductivity mechanisms,
   * and Q065 type room temperature superconductivity targets.

In AI contexts, Q061 is also a demanding benchmark for whether a model that claims to understand chemistry actually carries a coherent notion of bonding across weakly and strongly correlated regimes.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q061 sits inside the BlackHole graph across Q001 to Q125. Each edge has a one line reason grounded in components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites and structural tools at the effective layer.

* Q030 (BH_PHYS_QPHASE_MATTER_L3_030)
  Reason: supplies general language for quantum phases of matter, used to classify environments in which bonding occurs as part of a correlated phase.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: introduces paradigmatic strongly correlated mechanisms in cuprates and related materials, which become test beds for Q061 bonding descriptors.

* Q038 (BH_PHYS_QCOLD_ATOMS_L3_038)
  Reason: provides cold atom and optical lattice model systems where correlated bond like motifs can be tuned and observed.

* Q067 (BH_CHEM_QUANTUM_MOL_SIM_L3_067)
  Reason: gives the quantum simulation tools and benchmarks needed to supply many body state summaries for Q061 state space elements.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These reuse Q061 components or depend directly on its tension structure.

* Q065 (BH_CHEM_ROOMTC_SUPER_L3_065)
  Reason: uses Q061 correlated bond descriptors to formalize how pairing and coherence emerge in candidate room temperature superconductors.

* Q066 (BH_CHEM_ELECTROCHEM_L3_066)
  Reason: reuses bond tension metrics to characterize degradation pathways and reaction fronts in strongly correlated electrode materials.

* Q070 (BH_CHEM_SOFTMATTER_L3_070)
  Reason: adapts Q061 bonding descriptors to soft and disordered materials where correlated interactions govern self assembly.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: uses Q061 components as probes to test whether AI internal representations track physically meaningful bonding structure.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share related tension types without direct component dependence.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: both Q061 and Q036 are driven by spectral_tension between local interactions and emergent coherent phases in strongly correlated systems.

* Q064 (BH_CHEM_GLASS_TRANS_L3_064)
  Reason: both deal with emergent structures in rugged energy landscapes where simple pairwise pictures are insufficient.

* Q030 (BH_PHYS_QPHASE_MATTER_L3_030)
  Reason: both require a unified language for many body structures, though Q061 emphasizes bond and Q030 emphasizes phase.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q061 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: reuses tension between local microscopic interactions and macroscopic thermodynamic constraints to interpret bonds as structured contributions to energy and entropy budgets.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: reuses the idea of minimal thermodynamic and informational cost across correlated links between subsystems.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: uses Q061 bonding descriptors as ground truth concepts when assessing whether AI internal units correspond to physically interpretable structures.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only specify

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any TU deep-layer generative rules or mappings from raw data to internal TU fields. All mappings from raw many body data or experiments into the objects defined here are treated as external interfaces.

In the metadata, `Semantics: hybrid` indicates that Q061 simultaneously handles

* discrete labels such as atoms, sites, orbitals, views, phases,
* and continuous valued observables such as energies, correlation functions, and spectral quantities,

within a single effective-layer scheme.

### 3.1 State space

We assume an effective state space

```txt
M
```

where each state `m` in `M` represents a finite correlated chemical environment with

* a specified set of nuclei and nuclear positions in some bounded region,
* a strongly correlated electronic state associated with that environment, summarized at one or more resolutions,
* coarse metadata such as

  * symmetry sector,
  * approximate filling and spin sector,
  * temperature range or ground state versus finite temperature character.

We do not specify how the correlated state was obtained, or which quantum chemistry or many body method was used. We only require that

* for each benchmark system considered, there exist states `m` in `M` whose summaries are reproducible from independent calculations or experiments,
* resolutions can be refined in a controlled way, for example by enlarging active spaces or clusters, or by improving numerical accuracy.

We denote by

```txt
M_reg subset of M
```

the regular subset of `M` where all planned observables and invariants are well defined and finite. Section 3.6 gives a more explicit definition of this regular set in terms of singular states.

These assumptions define an effective interface for Q061. They are not claims about the completeness or uniqueness of any particular many body method or data source.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`. Each is defined at the level of summaries, not at the level of raw wavefunctions or experimental signals.

1. Local bond descriptor

```txt
B_local(m; pair)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a specified atomic pair or small motif `pair` within the environment.

* Output: a finite dimensional vector summarizing effective bonding properties for that pair, for example

  * correlated bond order estimates,
  * contributions to stabilization energy,
  * selected entanglement or correlation indicators,
  * possibly spectral information such as local reduced density matrix eigenvalues.

* Constraint: `B_local(m; pair)` must be finite and defined for all admissible pairs in `M_reg`.

2. Local correlation indicator

```txt
C_corr(m; region)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a region containing one or more atomic positions.

* Output: scalar or low dimensional summary indicators of correlation strength in that region, such as

  * double occupancy statistics,
  * spin correlation functions,
  * entanglement entropies between fragments,
  * spectra of local correlation matrices when available.

* Constraint: `C_corr(m; region)` must be comparable across states when the same region type is used.

3. Multi view bonding descriptor

```txt
X_view(m; view, pair)
```

* Input: a state `m`, a label `view` denoting a bonding language (for example MO_like, VB_like, entanglement_like), and a pair or motif.
* Output: the effective bond descriptor for that pair in the specified view, expressed in a common numerical format. This format may itself be built from spectral quantities, for example eigenvalues of local density matrices or canonical orbital occupation patterns.
* Constraint: for each fixed `view`, `X_view` must be derived from a single admissible encoding procedure applied across all states in a benchmark suite, with no per system tuning.

4. Bonding pattern summary

```txt
S_pattern(m)
```

* Input: a state `m`.

* Output: a coarse summary of the bonding pattern across the environment, for example

  * a labeled graph indicating strong, weak, resonant, or frustrated bonds,
  * a small set of pattern codes representing motifs such as chains, plaquettes, dimers.

* Constraint: `S_pattern(m)` must be invariant under relabelings that preserve the physical identity of the environment.

All these observables are defined at the effective layer. The details of how they are computed from underlying states or experiments are delegated to external methods and are not part of TU generative rules.

### 3.3 Admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints

To prevent post hoc tuning and unfair reduction of tension, we define an admissible class of encoding schemes.

#### 3.3.1 Encoding identifiers

For Q061 we consider encoding schemes labeled by identifiers such as

```txt
EncodingKey: Q061_BOND_CORE_V1
LibraryKey: Q061_BOND_LIB_V1
WeightKey: Q061_BOND_WEIGHTS_V1
RefinementKey: Q061_BOND_REFINE_V1
```

These keys are used for audit and version tracking. They do not claim that the corresponding encoding is unique or correct in any ultimate sense.

#### 3.3.2 Encoding schemes

An encoding scheme `E` consists of

* a choice of

  * local environments and regions,
  * numerical routines for computing `B_local`, `C_corr`, `X_view`, and `S_pattern` from external data,

* fixed hyperparameters, including

  * thresholds for classifying bonds as strong, weak, resonant, or frustrated,
  * weights for combining different sub descriptors within each observable.

#### 3.3.3 Admissible class constraints

An encoding scheme `E` is admissible if

* the same routines and hyperparameters are used for all states in a benchmark suite,
* hyperparameters are fixed before tension scores are evaluated on the suite,
* no hyperparameter depends on

  * the identity of a particular system in the suite,
  * or the observed values of `B_local`, `C_corr`, `X_view`, or `S_pattern` for that system.

In particular

```txt
E does not adapt its parameters case by case after seeing tension scores.
```

#### 3.3.4 Reference libraries and fairness

Many encodings rely on reference libraries, for example

* prototype bonding patterns,
* reference fragments with known correlated states.

We require that

* reference libraries are fixed before evaluation on a given benchmark suite,
* the choice of library does not depend on the particular systems whose tension scores are being measured,
* any expansion of a reference library is recorded as a new encoding scheme `E'`, not as a post hoc correction inside `E`.

This fairness constraint ensures that Q061 tension scores cannot be arbitrarily reduced by later customizing the encoding to each problematic system.

### 3.4 Invariants and tension scores

We now define invariants that measure how well bonding concepts behave in strongly correlated regimes. The tension type is labeled `spectral_tension` to emphasize that these invariants can be constructed from, or strongly influenced by, spectral data such as eigenvalues of reduced density matrices or correlation matrices.

1. View consistency invariant

For a state `m`, define a multi view mismatch

```txt
I_view(m) = max over view1, view2, pair in P(m)
            D( X_view(m; view1, pair), X_view(m; view2, pair) )
```

where

* `P(m)` is the set of relevant pairs or motifs in `m`,
* `D` is a fixed distance on the space of descriptors, which may itself depend on spectral features.

Properties

* `I_view(m) >= 0`,
* `I_view(m) = 0` only if all admissible views give identical descriptors for all pairs.

2. Correlation compatibility invariant

Let `I_corr(m)` measure the mismatch between

* bond descriptors `B_local(m; pair)`,
* and correlation indicators `C_corr(m; region)` in regions that include the pair.

Conceptually

```txt
I_corr(m) = aggregate over pairs and regions of
            mismatch( B_local(m; pair), C_corr(m; region) )
```

with

* `I_corr(m) >= 0`,
* small `I_corr(m)` when bond descriptors and correlation patterns tell a coherent story.

3. Core bond tension functional

We define the Q061 bond tension functional

```txt
Tension_bond(m) = w_view * I_view(m) + w_corr * I_corr(m)
```

with weights constrained by

```txt
w_view + w_corr = 1
w_min <= w_view <= 1 - w_min
w_min <= w_corr <= 1 - w_min
```

for some fixed `w_min` in `(0, 0.5)` chosen once per encoding scheme `E`.

These conditions ensure that both terms contribute meaningfully and prevent trivial encodings where one part is effectively ignored.

### 3.5 Refinement order and stability

We introduce a refinement index

```txt
r = 1, 2, 3, ...
```

where increasing `r` corresponds to, for example

* enlarging active spaces,
* refining numerical accuracy,
* increasing the size of correlated clusters or unit cells.

For a given physical system, we obtain a sequence of states

```txt
m_1, m_2, m_3, ...
```

representing increasing refinement under an admissible encoding scheme.

We then examine the sequence

```txt
Tension_bond(m_r)  for r = 1, 2, 3, ...
```

As part of the definition of the admissible encoding class for Q061, we require that admissible encodings obey

* boundedness

  ```txt
  sup over r of Tension_bond(m_r) < infinity
  ```

* stability in the low tension regime

  if a system is to be considered a low tension example under encoding `E`, then

  ```txt
  limsup as r -> infinity of Tension_bond(m_r)
  ```

  must stay below a fixed band determined and published as part of `E`.

These conditions are constraints on the design of encodings for Q061. They are not physical assertions about real materials or about the universe. Their purpose is to prevent using uncontrolled refinement to artificially wash away tension, and to provide a way to distinguish persistent high tension from finite resolution artifacts.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may be pathological or poorly defined at the level of Q061 observables. We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           Tension_bond(m) is undefined or not finite
           or either I_view(m) or I_corr(m) is undefined or not finite }
```

Consistent with Section 3.1, we then define the regular set

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All Q061 analysis is restricted to `M_reg`. If an experimental or computational protocol produces a state in `S_sing`, this is treated as out of domain for Q061, not as evidence for or against the existence of a unified bond concept.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q061 is characterized as a tension problem at the effective layer, in terms of the bond tension functional defined above.

### 4.1 Core tension statement

Given an admissible encoding scheme `E`, Q061 asks whether

* there exists a family of states in `M_reg` representing strongly correlated systems such that

  * the bond tension `Tension_bond(m)` is consistently small and stable under refinement,
  * bonding concepts remain coherent across views and correlation indicators,

or instead

* for every admissible encoding scheme, some strongly correlated systems necessarily exhibit persistent high bond tension that cannot be removed without violating fairness constraints.

In short:

> Is there an admissible encoding of chemical bond in strongly correlated systems that yields low and stable bond tension across a wide benchmark, or is persistent high tension unavoidable?

This is a question about the behavior of encodings and tension functionals on families of systems. It is not a theorem about the universe or a claim that any particular encoding succeeds.

### 4.2 Low tension correlated bonding principle

A low tension realization of Q061 satisfies:

For a large benchmark set of correlated systems and an admissible encoding scheme `E`, there exist states `m` in `M_reg` such that

```txt
Tension_bond(m) <= epsilon_bond
```

for a small threshold `epsilon_bond` chosen and published for `E`, and this inequality remains valid (possibly with slightly adjusted but still small bands) as refinements `m_r` are considered.

Furthermore

* cross view discrepancies `I_view(m)` remain small,
* mismatch between bond descriptors and correlation indicators `I_corr(m)` remains small,
* these properties hold in both

  * reference weakly correlated systems,
  * and strongly correlated systems designed to stress the concept of bonding.

### 4.3 High tension correlated bonding principle

A high tension realization of Q061 occurs when, for every admissible encoding scheme `E`, there exists at least one correlated system whose states in `M_reg` satisfy

```txt
Tension_bond(m) >= delta_bond
```

for some strictly positive `delta_bond` that cannot be made arbitrarily small by

* refining the resolution,
* or adjusting admissible hyperparameters without violating fairness constraints.

In this case

* either cross view mismatches remain large,
* or bond descriptors cannot be reconciled with correlation indicators,
* or both.

At the effective layer, Q061 thus provides a way to classify possible scenarios:

* scenarios where at least one admissible encoding realizes a low tension bonded world across a wide benchmark,
* scenarios where every admissible encoding must confront persistent high tension in some correlated systems.

This classification is about the structure and limitations of encodings under the stated constraints. It does not assert which scenario is realized in our universe.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe counterfactual worlds purely in terms of observable patterns and inequalities, without referring to TU deep-layer generative rules or making any claim that these worlds are realized.

### 5.1 World T: unified correlated bond concept

World T is a scenario in which

1. There exists at least one admissible encoding scheme `E_T` for which

   * for a wide benchmark spanning weakly and strongly correlated systems

     * `Tension_bond(m)` is typically small,
     * distributions of `I_view(m)` and `I_corr(m)` remain within narrow bands.

2. As correlation strength is increased

   * bond descriptors change smoothly,
   * phase transitions are visible as structural changes in `S_pattern(m)`,
   * yet the core notion of a bond remains identifiable and coherent.

3. Different theoretical views

   * molecular orbital like, valence bond like, and entanglement based descriptors,

   can be mapped into each other with bounded mismatch, as measured by `I_view(m)`.

World T does not claim that all systems are simple. It claims that, once an admissible encoding is fixed, a unified concept of bond survives even in strongly correlated regimes as a low tension effective object.

### 5.2 World F: intrinsically fragmented correlated bond concept

World F is a scenario in which, for every admissible encoding scheme `E`,

1. There exists at least one correlated system `m` in `M_reg` such that

   ```txt
   Tension_bond(m) >= delta_bond
   ```

   for some `delta_bond > 0` that cannot be reduced into the low tension band by refining the encoding without violating fairness constraints.

2. Attempts to reconcile different views

   * produce large `I_view(m)` in some systems,
   * or lead to encodings that perform well in some regimes but fail badly in others.

3. Trends across correlation strength

   * show qualitative breakdowns in bond descriptors that cannot be smoothed out in any admissible encoding.

In World F, chemical bond in strongly correlated systems is not a single coherent effective object. It is intrinsically fragmented into context dependent stories that cannot be made globally low tension.

### 5.3 Role of counterfactual worlds in Q061

The World T and World F descriptions are used to

* design experiments and protocols that attempt to falsify specific encodings,
* test whether particular encoding schemes behave more like World T or World F on benchmark suites,
* structure reasoning about how far bond can be stretched as a concept.

These counterfactuals do not require or reveal any TU deep-layer mechanism. They only refer to observable tension patterns and admissible encoding classes. They are tools for thinking about encodings, not claims about which world we live in.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can

* test the coherence of the Q061 encoding,
* distinguish between low tension and high tension behaviors,
* falsify specific choices of encoding scheme and hyperparameters.

They do not prove or disprove the existence of a unique chemical bond concept. They test whether a given encoding behaves as claimed under the stated fairness constraints. In all experiments below, the primary object of evaluation is the encoding scheme and its tension functional, not the universe.

### Experiment 1: Correlated bonding benchmark suite

Goal:

* Test whether a fixed admissible encoding scheme `E` can maintain low and stable bond tension across a curated suite of weakly and strongly correlated systems.

Setup:

* Construct a benchmark suite that includes

  * small molecules with well understood bonding (for calibration),
  * transition metal complexes with known multireference character,
  * correlated molecular clusters, for example diradicals,
  * simple model solids and lattice systems exhibiting Mott behavior.

* For each system

  * obtain or assume the existence of converged many body state summaries and correlated observables,
  * generate states `m` in `M` representing these summaries at multiple refinement levels.

Protocol:

1. Fix an admissible encoding scheme `E` with identifiers such as `Q061_BOND_CORE_V1`:

   * choose definitions of `B_local`, `C_corr`, `X_view`, and `S_pattern`,
   * fix all hyperparameters and reference libraries for the entire suite,
   * publish the low tension band for `Tension_bond` as part of the definition of `E`.

2. For each system and each refinement level

   * construct the corresponding state `m_r` in `M`,
   * compute `I_view(m_r)`, `I_corr(m_r)`, and `Tension_bond(m_r)`.

3. For each system

   * analyze the sequence `Tension_bond(m_r)` as `r` increases,
   * compute summary statistics such as mean, variance, and limsup.

4. Compare tension distributions between

   * weakly correlated reference systems,
   * strongly correlated systems in the suite.

Metrics:

* For each system

  * limsup over `r` of `Tension_bond(m_r)`,
  * range of `Tension_bond(m_r)` across refinements.

* For the suite

  * fraction of systems whose limsup tension lies within the pre defined low tension band,
  * difference between distributions of limsup tension in weakly and strongly correlated subsets.

Falsification conditions:

* If, under the fixed admissible encoding `E`, a substantial fraction of strongly correlated benchmark systems exhibit

  ```txt
  limsup as r -> infinity of Tension_bond(m_r) >= delta_bond
  ```

  with `delta_bond` exceeding the declared low tension band by a significant factor, then

  * either `E` fails as a candidate unified bond encoding for strongly correlated systems,
  * or the claim that Q061 admits a low tension realization under `E` is falsified.

* If small changes in hyperparameters within `E` can flip many systems from low tension to high tension or the reverse without clear physical justification, then

  * `E` is considered unstable and rejected as an encoding that meaningfully addresses Q061.

Semantics implementation note:

* This experiment assumes that the effective state space and observables treat both discrete indices (sites, orbitals, atom labels) and continuous coordinates in a manner consistent with the hybrid semantics specified in the metadata.
* No change of semantics is made between different systems or refinements.

Boundary note:

* Falsifying a particular encoding scheme or tension functional in this experiment does not solve the canonical problem and does not prove or disprove the existence of a unified bond concept. It only rules out that encoding as a satisfactory answer to Q061 under the stated constraints.

### Experiment 2: Tunable lattice and cold atom realizations

Goal:

* Assess whether Q061 encodings can track correlated bonding like motifs across controlled crossovers between localized and delocalized regimes in model systems.

Setup:

* Consider a family of lattice models, for example Hubbard type, and their cold atom or solid state realizations with tunable parameters

  * interaction strength,
  * filling,
  * dimensionality,
  * geometry (chains, ladders, plaquettes).

* For each model

  * identify ranges of parameters where

    * localized bond like singlets are expected,
    * extended metallic or superconducting behavior is expected.

Protocol:

1. For each parameter setting

   * obtain or assume many body state summaries, for example from numerical simulations or experimental inference,
   * construct states `m` in `M` with appropriate metadata.

2. Under a fixed admissible encoding scheme `E`:

   * compute `B_local(m; pair)` and `C_corr(m; region)` for relevant motifs such as nearest neighbors or plaquettes,
   * derive `X_view(m; view, pair)` for at least two views,
   * compute `Tension_bond(m)`.

3. Track how `Tension_bond(m)` changes as parameters are tuned across localization to delocalization and phase transition boundaries.

4. Compare tension patterns with known qualitative physical behavior.

Metrics:

* For each model

  * tension profiles as a function of interaction strength and filling,
  * correlation between low tension regions and regimes where the notion of local singlets or dimers is physically meaningful.

* Across models

  * consistency of how `Tension_bond(m)` signals

    * the emergence of well defined local pairs,
    * the breakdown of simple bond pictures.

Falsification conditions:

* If, in regimes where physics strongly suggests well defined local singlets or dimers,

  * `Tension_bond(m)` consistently remains high,
  * or fluctuates erratically with refinement,

  then the encoding `E` fails to capture physically meaningful bonding in these correlated systems.

* If, in regimes where extended metallic behavior dominates and local bond pictures are known to be misleading,

  * `Tension_bond(m)` is systematically lower than in singlet dominated regimes,

  then `E` is misaligned with the intended interpretation of bond tension and is rejected.

Semantics implementation note:

* Discrete lattice structure and continuous control parameters are handled within the same hybrid semantics framework as in Experiment 1. The encoding treats these consistently across all parameter points.

Boundary note:

* This experiment can demonstrate that particular encodings fail to align with controlled model behavior, but it does not prove that no encoding could succeed. It does not transform Q061 into a theorem. It only evaluates encodings under Q061 style constraints.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q061 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals derived from Q061 observables.

1. `signal_bond_tension`

   * Definition: numeric signal equal to `Tension_bond(m)` or a normalized variant.
   * Use: penalize internal representations that correspond to high tension bonding stories when the context demands a unified notion of bond.

2. `signal_view_consistency`

   * Definition: derived from `I_view(m)`; high values indicate inconsistency between bonding views.
   * Use: train models to maintain consistent explanations across different requested languages of bonding for the same system.

3. `signal_corr_compatibility`

   * Definition: derived from `I_corr(m)`; high values indicate mismatch between bond descriptors and correlation indicators.
   * Use: discourage models from describing strong correlation effects in ways that contradict their own bonding language.

4. `signal_phase_aware_bonding`

   * Definition: a signal that tracks whether bonds are described in ways consistent with the known phase of the system, for example insulating, metallic, superconducting, as supplied by Q030 type modules.
   * Use: encourage alignment between bonding narratives and phase information from upstream problems.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q061 structures without revealing any TU deep-layer rules.

1. `CorrelatedBondingHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a chemical or material system, output

     * predicted bond tension scores,
     * flags indicating where bonds are likely ill defined or view dependent.

   * Interface:

     * Input: latent embeddings representing the system and its correlation context.
     * Output: scalar `Tension_bond_hat`, approximate `I_view_hat`, `I_corr_hat`, plus auxiliary classifications.

2. `MultiViewBondingConsistencyModule`

   * Role: generate multiple bonding explanations in different languages and assess their consistency.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embeddings plus a set of requested views.
     * Output: synthetic explanations per view, plus a consistency score aligned with `I_view(m)`.

3. `PhaseAwareBondingModule`

   * Role: ensure that bonding descriptions are compatible with phase labels supplied by Q030 type modules.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embeddings plus phase descriptors.
     * Output: adjusted or flagged bonding narratives, together with compatibility scores.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for AI systems augmented with Q061 modules.

1. Task construction

   * Compile tasks that require

     * comparing bonding in weakly versus strongly correlated systems,
     * explaining why conventional bond pictures fail or succeed in specific cases,
     * translating between molecular orbital like, valence bond like, and entanglement based descriptions.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline

     * model without explicit Q061 modules,
     * standard supervision on correctness of answers only.

   * TU enhanced

     * same model plus

       * `CorrelatedBondingHead`,
       * `MultiViewBondingConsistencyModule`,
       * Q061 derived training signals.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on factual questions about bonding in correlated systems.

   * Consistency of explanations across

     * different prompts,
     * different requested languages of bonding.

   * Alignment with external expert judgments about which bonds are well defined and which are ambiguous.

4. Logging

   * For each evaluation

     * prompts and model outputs,
     * Q061 tension related signals,
     * any flags indicating high tension regions.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience how Q061 affects AI explanations.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to compare bonding in a simple molecule, such as methane, and in a strongly correlated material, such as a cuprate layer, without mentioning Q061 or tension.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation

    * acknowledges correlation,
    * confuses phases,
    * or applies simple bond language indiscriminately.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same systems, but explicitly request

    * a discussion of where conventional bond concepts break down,
    * an indication of high tension bonds according to Q061 style criteria.

  * Observation: record whether

    * the model distinguishes low tension and high tension bonding regimes,
    * explains why correlated systems are problematic for simple bond pictures.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric that scores

    * correctness of physical statements,
    * clarity about correlation,
    * internal consistency between different parts of the explanation.

* What to log

  * Both runs prompts and outputs,
  * predicted Q061 tension scores,
  * any explicit flags about high tension bonds.

This protocol does not require exposing TU deep-layer mechanisms. It only uses effective-layer Q061 signals and structures.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains Q061s place on the TU verification ladder and the next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * Q061 has

    * a clearly specified effective state space,
    * defined observables and invariants,
    * admissible encoding and fairness constraints,
    * at least two explicit experiments with falsification conditions.

  * It does not yet have

    * fully implemented benchmark datasets,
    * numerical values for tension bands across a concrete suite.

* N_level: N1

  * Q061 has

    * a coherent narrative linking bonding, correlation, and tension,
    * a clear separation between low tension and high tension worlds,
    * a roadmap for AI integration.

  * It still needs

    * more detailed examples per class of systems,
    * fully fleshed out case studies.

No theorem level claims about the existence or non existence of a unified bond concept are made in this entry. Q061 is a structured framework for asking and testing such claims in terms of encodings and tension functionals.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To advance Q061 from E1 to E2, the following steps are proposed:

1. Construct at least one concrete benchmark suite of systems:

   * specify members, correlation regimes, and many body methods,
   * publish or otherwise fix state summaries that can be used to instantiate `M_reg`.

2. Implement a reference admissible encoding scheme `E_ref`:

   * define numerical routines for `B_local`, `C_corr`, `X_view`, and `S_pattern`,
   * fix hyperparameters and reference libraries,
   * document and publish their choices,
   * publish low tension bands for `Tension_bond` under `E_ref`.

3. Execute at least one of the experiments in Section 6 with `E_ref`:

   * report tension distributions,
   * measure how many systems fall into low tension versus high tension bands.

At that point, Q061 will have a concrete instantiation of its abstract structures and empirical data about whether `E_ref` behaves closer to World T or World F.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q061 is expected to serve as

* the anchor node for all bonding in correlated systems problems across chemistry and condensed matter,

* a template for handling scientific concepts that are

  * intuitive and heavily used,
  * but stressed and reshaped by strong correlation,

* a cross domain bridge between

  * chemical bonding,
  * quantum phases and emergent phenomena,
  * AI systems that claim to learn or manipulate high level physical concepts.

As the TU program matures, Q061 will help clarify whether bond remains a useful and unified effective object in the correlated regime, or whether it must be replaced by more explicitly many body structures.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non expert explanation that remains aligned with the effective-layer description.

In simple terms, textbook chemistry often treats a chemical bond as

* a kind of glue between atoms,
* something you can draw as a line in a Lewis structure,
* something that can be counted and classified in a straightforward way.

For many molecules this works very well. Different theories may use different language, but they all agree on which atoms are bonded and how strong those bonds are.

In strongly correlated systems, electrons interact with each other so strongly that

* several electronic arrangements are almost equally important,
* electrons may be partly localized and partly delocalized,
* the system may change its behavior dramatically when you change a parameter a little.

In these situations

* one theory may say two atoms are strongly bonded,
* another may say the bond is weak or not really there,
* a third may say the important objects are not simple bonds at all but larger patterns.

Q061 asks, at a structured and measurable level:

* Can we still talk about a bond in such systems in a way that is

  * consistent across different theories,
  * robust when we change details of the system,
  * and usable as a building block in our understanding?

The Tension Universe approach does not try to answer this with a slogan. Instead it

1. defines a space of states `M` that summarize what is known about strongly correlated systems,

2. defines numbers that measure

   * how much different bonding stories disagree (`I_view`),
   * how well bond descriptions match correlation patterns (`I_corr`),

3. combines these into a bond tension `Tension_bond(m)`.

If the bond concept is truly unified in the correlated world, we expect that for many systems, under a fair and fixed encoding scheme, this bond tension stays small and stable as we refine our descriptions.

If, no matter how we encode things fairly, some systems always show large and persistent bond tension, this suggests that

* the usual idea of a bond stops being a single, clean concept in those regimes,
* we may need to work with more explicitly many body objects instead.

Q061 does not declare which answer is correct. It builds a precise framework

* to ask the question in a way that can be tested,
* to compare different proposals for what a bond should mean in strongly correlated systems,
* and to connect this question to other deep problems in physics, chemistry, and AI.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection and should be interpreted strictly at the effective layer.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the problem named in the header metadata.
* It restates and structures the canonical scientific question in terms of state spaces, observables, invariants, and tension scores.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical statement about the ultimate nature of the chemical bond in strongly correlated systems.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding scientific problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* This page does not specify any TU deep-layer axiom system, generative rule, or mapping from raw data to TU fields.
* References to numerical simulations, experiments, or many body methods are treated as external data sources and interfaces, not as components of TU itself.
* No claim is made that the encoding in this file is unique or complete. Alternative encodings may exist and may be preferable for other purposes.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding schemes described here belong to an explicit admissible class whose members are identified by keys such as `EncodingKey`, `LibraryKey`, `WeightKey`, and `RefinementKey`.
* Admissible schemes must obey fairness constraints: hyperparameters and reference libraries are fixed before evaluation on a benchmark suite and are not tuned case by case after inspecting tension scores.
* Boundedness and stability conditions on tension under refinement are part of the definition of the admissible encoding class and are not physical assertions about real materials.
* Falsifying a particular encoding scheme or tension functional in the sense defined in this file does not falsify TU as a whole. It only shows that this encoding is not an adequate answer to Q061 under the stated constraints.

### Relation to the TU program

* This page is one node in a larger program that studies scientific and mathematical problems through effective-layer encodings and tension patterns.
* It is intended to be read together with other TU documents that describe global principles, tension scales, and encoding rules.
* Nothing in this page should be interpreted as a claim that the TU framework has been proved correct or complete as a theory of anything beyond the effective layer described here.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
