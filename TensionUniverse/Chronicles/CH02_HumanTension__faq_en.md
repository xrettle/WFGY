## 1 | How to read this FAQ

### Q1. Why is there a whole FAQ just for human tension?

Because for most readers, “tension” only becomes real when it touches everyday life: crushes, relationships, jealousy, shame, and the feeling of “I am behind”. The TU-CH02 story uses a future historian to talk about these things in a narrative way. This FAQ is the matching “plain talk” document.

So you can think of this file as a bridge between three layers:

1. Story: the feelings and images in TU-CH02.  
2. Science notes: the variables and simple models in `TU-CH02_HumanTension__science_en.md`.  
3. BlackHole archive: the 131 S-class questions that generalize these patterns to mind, AI, economics, climate, and so on.

This FAQ stays mostly on the human side. It uses simple language and concrete examples, so that you can apply the “tension” view to your own life without needing to read everything else first.

---

### Q2. Is this FAQ trying to give life advice, or is it just a thinking tool?

It is much closer to a thinking tool.

It is not therapy, not a self-help program, and not a set of instructions for how you “should” live. It does not know your personal history, trauma, culture, or current constraints.

What it does try to give you is a cleaner language:

- to describe what is pulling you in different directions;  
- to see which demands cannot be satisfied at the same time;  
- to ask “who is carrying this tension right now?”;  
- and to notice when your own standards are being quietly rewritten by outside signals.

If you already have therapy, coaching, or your own philosophical practice, you can drop this in as one extra lens, nothing more. If you do not, you can still use it as a way to ask better questions about what is happening inside you and between you and others.

---

### Q3. Do I need to understand all 131 questions to use this?

No.

The 131 questions in the BlackHole archive are written as a kind of “century exam” for worldviews and AI systems. They cover many domains: consciousness, free will, dark matter, climate, financial crashes, AI alignment, and civilizational collapse.

For human relationships and everyday emotion, you can start with these smaller pieces:

- the three self variables: `self_now`, `self_ideal`, `self_projected`;  
- the relationship variables: `shared_imagination(t)` and `maintenance_load(t)`;  
- the idea that comparison slowly drags `self_ideal` upwards;  
- and the question “which ledger is this tension written in, and who signed it?”.

Later, if you are curious, you can open a few specific questions that are close to your interests and use AI tools to help translate and unpack them. You never need to “finish” all 131.

---

## 2 | Basic concept questions about “tension”

### Q4. When you say “tension”, is that just another word for stress or anxiety?

No. Stress and anxiety are how tension often feels from the inside. But in this setting, “tension” has a more structural meaning.

In the Tension Universe language, tension appears when three things are all true at once:

1. There are two or more demands or desires in the system.  
2. They cannot all be satisfied fully at the same time.  
3. The system cares about this conflict enough that it cannot ignore it.

So tension is not just “I am busy” or “I feel nervous”. It is “the universe of this situation is trying to satisfy incompatible demands, and there is a ledger keeping track of who pays the price”.

Sometimes this is painful, like a conflict between work and health. Sometimes it is meaningful, like the strain of training for a marathon or building something hard. The feeling can be similar, but the structure and meaning are very different.

---

### Q5. Does higher tension always mean “worse”? Is a 0.8 relationship always bad and 0.2 always good?

No. The “0 to 1” picture in the story is not a moral score. It is more like a knob for “how strong is the pull in this part of your life”.

A few examples:

- A 0.2 phase in a relationship might feel calm, safe, and stabilizing. Or it might feel flat and empty, like nothing matters.  
- A 0.8 phase might be the intense early stage of falling in love, full of excitement and growth. Or it might be a destructive cycle of fights and reconciliations, close to breakdown.  
- A 0.5 life might feel “balanced” to one person and “stuck” to another, depending on what they want to move.

So instead of “0.2 good, 0.8 bad”, the model asks different questions:

- What is generating this tension?  
- Where is it trying to push you?  
- Is there a stable posture from which this tension becomes growth instead of damage?  
- Who is carrying it voluntarily, and who has no real choice?

The number is not a grade. It is a way to notice which parts of your life are quiet and which ones are heavily loaded.

---

### Q6. What is the difference between tension, energy, and “vibes”?

These three words overlap in everyday talk, but they are not the same here.

- **Energy** is often used for “how much capacity do I feel I have right now?”. You can have high tension and zero energy, or high tension and high energy.  
- **Vibes** is a loose word for “the overall feeling in a space or interaction”. Vibes can be calm, chaotic, joyful, heavy.  
- **Tension**, in this model, is specifically about conflicts between demands that cannot all be met, plus a ledger of “who is paying”.

For example:

- A party can have high energy and good vibes but low tension: everyone is just relaxed.  
- A meeting can have low energy but high tension: nobody shows strong emotion, but several people are silently thinking “if this goes wrong, my job is at risk”.  
- A team working on a hard deadline can have high energy and high tension, but in a productive way, if the direction is clear and everyone agrees why they are doing it.

Tension is not the same as mood. It lives in the structure of what is being asked of you and others, and in how those asks conflict.

---

### Q7. How do self_now, self_ideal, and self_projected relate to normal feelings like guilt, shame, and pride?

Very roughly, you can imagine:

- **Guilt** tends to show up when your actions fall short of your own values. In this language, that is a gap between `self_now` and the part of `self_ideal` that you consciously endorse.  
- **Shame** often appears when you imagine that other people see you as deeply flawed or unworthy. That is a painful gap between `self_now` and `self_projected`, especially when `self_projected` is written by your fears.  
- **Pride** can appear when `self_now` comes closer to `self_ideal` in a way that feels earned and aligned, and when you imagine that others can see this growth in you.

Of course, real human emotion is more complex than three variables, but these variables give you handles.

Instead of “I feel bad again”, you can sometimes say:

- “Right now my `self_ideal` is very high and narrow, and `self_now` is nowhere near it.”  
- “Right now my `self_projected` is dominated by one harsh voice from years ago.”  
- “Right now I am borrowing standards from people whose lives are nothing like mine.”

Sometimes just naming which distance is hurting can reduce the confusion around the feeling, even if it does not make the tension disappear.

---

## 3 | Crushes, unread messages, and overthinking

### Q8. Why does one unread or unanswered message hurt so much in this model?

Because the message itself is not the whole story. The real action is happening in your self layer.

When you send a message and see it marked as “read, no reply”, several different internal movies can start playing:

- “I said something stupid. They are disgusted or bored.”  
- “Maybe they like me, but they do not want to look too eager.”  
- “They are busy. I am overreacting.”  
- “They are talking to ten other people and I am the backup plan.”

Each of these movies corresponds to a different draft of `self_projected`:

- In one draft, you are annoying.  
- In another, you are attractive but must perform perfectly.  
- In another, you are invisible.

While you wait, these drafts coexist. Your body reacts as if more than one of them might be true. Your heart rate, your thoughts, your impulses all move as if the ledger has not yet decided which story will be written down as “what happened”.

So the pain is not just “they did not reply”. It is “I am stuck inside a cloud of competing self-images, and I cannot yet know which one will be confirmed”.

This model does not make the feeling go away. It just lets you see that you are not “crazy” for being affected. A lot of calculation is happening under the surface.

---

### Q9. Is overthinking just “bad tension management” here?

Not exactly. Overthinking in this frame is what happens when:

- The ledger entry is still open.  
- Several drafts of `self_projected` or `self_ideal` are competing.  
- And you keep sampling each draft again and again, trying to predict which one will win.

So overthinking is not “you are weak”. It is more like “your forecasting system is working overtime with too little data”.

When this happens, your mind is trying to reduce tension by:

- gathering more imagined evidence;  
- rehearsing different futures;  
- simulating arguments or explanations.

Sometimes this helps. For example, rehearsing how to apologize can lead to a better real conversation later. But many times, the real missing piece is not “more simulation”. It is “a new event in the outside world”, like an actual reply or a clarifying talk.

From the tension view, one healthy move is to say to yourself:

> “Right now I am stuck in an open ledger entry with too many drafts.  
> I can note the drafts, but I do not have to treat any of them as final until something real happens.”

That does not shut down the mind by force. It just reminds you that the system is in a “draft” state, and that not every draft deserves full emotional weight.

---

### Q10. Can thinking in terms of tension really help when I am waiting for someone to reply? Or does it just add more concepts on top?

It can help, but only if you use it gently.

Here is a small way to use the model in real time:

1. Notice you are stuck on the message.  
2. Ask: “Which drafts of `self_projected` are running right now?”  
   Maybe you list two or three sentences.  
3. Ask: “Which of these drafts is actually supported by hard evidence?”  
   Often, the answer is “almost none”.  
4. Ask: “If I had to live with uncertainty for a few hours, what is the kindest thing I can do for `self_now` while I wait?”  

That last question turns the lens away from “predict them” and toward “care for the part of me that is waiting”. It is still tension, but instead of just spinning it, you are deciding how to hold it.

So the value of this model is not that it gives the “true story” about the other person. It gives you a structured way to not abuse yourself while the story is still unknown.

---

### Q11. How does this model treat one-sided crushes or parasocial relationships?

In a one-sided crush or a parasocial bond (with a streamer, celebrity, or creator), `shared_imagination(t)` can become very rich inside your head, while on the other side:

- the person does not even know you exist; or  
- knows you only as one of many followers; or  
- sees you only through a very narrow interaction channel.

From your side, the tension ledger feels like a joint account. There is a “we” story, and you imagine their reactions, their preferences, their inner life. But structurally, there is no real shared ledger. There is only a projection.

This does not mean the feeling is fake. The emotions are real. But the load-bearing structure is different from a mutual relationship:

- You are writing and carrying almost all of the tension.  
- The other side is mostly a template that you fill in.  
- If the template changes (for example, the creator acts in a way that breaks your image), the ledger can collapse suddenly and painfully.

Seeing it this way does not forbid parasocial bonds. It just lets you ask:

- “How much of my `shared_imagination` is actually negotiated with this person?”  
- “How much investment am I putting into a ledger that only I can see?”  

Sometimes, bringing even a small part of that energy back to relationships where both people can actually sign the ledger can change your life significantly.

---

## 4 | Relationships before and after “officially together”

### Q12. What exactly do you mean by “shared imagination” in a relationship? Is this just having similar goals?

Shared imagination is bigger and softer than a list of goals.

Goals sound like: “We will save X money”, “We will move to Y city”, “We will have Z children”.

Shared imagination includes:

- how you picture mornings and evenings together;  
- how you imagine supporting each other in bad times;  
- which stories you tell about “how we met” and “what kind of couple we are”;  
- what you believe about how fights will be resolved;  
- how you think your lives will feel, not just what you will achieve.

You can have similar official goals but very different shared imagination. For example:

- You both say “we want to build a company”.  
- One of you imagines a small stable business that buys freedom from bosses.  
- The other imagines a high-growth startup that might burn ten years in chaos.

On paper, the goals match. In the tension ledger, they do not. The `shared_imagination(t)` object would look different inside each person’s head.

This is why the model treats shared imagination as a core variable. It is where many hidden tensions live long before any “big decision” is made.

---

### Q13. How can I tell whether our current tension is “future tension” or just “maintenance tension”?

A few possible signs, none of them perfect:

- In future tension, many of your hard conversations still point toward something new: “If we fix this, we can move closer to that shared picture.”  
- In maintenance tension, most hard conversations are about stopping things from getting worse: “If we do not do this, something will break.”  

You can ask yourself:

- When we talk about the future, do our eyes light up or do we only list problems?  
- Do we still bring new possibilities into the shared imagination, or do we mostly repeat old complaints?  
- When we are tired, do we sometimes still choose to invest in future-building actions, or do we only patch immediate fires?

In the model language:

- Future tension is dominated by the term with `gap_to_shared_future(t)` and a meaningful `a(t)`.  
- Maintenance tension is dominated by `maintenance_load(t)` and an increasing `b(t)`.

Both are part of any long relationship. It becomes dangerous when future tension disappears almost completely and only maintenance tension remains for a long time.

---

### Q14. What if my partner and I have very different self_ideal shapes? Does the model say anything about that?

Yes, it suggests a few things to look at.

If your `self_ideal` and your partner’s `self_ideal` are very different, then:

- Their sense of “what a good life looks like” may point in a different direction from yours.  
- Their priorities about work, family, money, fame, freedom, stability, and risk can be encoded very differently.  
- The shared imagination may be stretched between two incompatible target configurations.

The tension view does not say “this cannot work”. It asks:

- Are these differences explicit and spoken, or are they hidden and assumed?  
- Does the shared imagination include a third shape that both of you can live in, or are you each secretly hoping the other will conform to your `self_ideal`?  
- When conflicts arise, do you both see them as “our shared tension against the world”, or as “my tension against your wrong priorities”?

If both `self_ideal` shapes are respected and there is space to negotiate a shared middle, the tension can drive growth for both people. If one shape is always treated as “correct” and the other as “needs to be fixed”, the suppressed side often ends up carrying more invisible ledger entries, which shows up as resentment or numbness later.

---

### Q15. Does this tension view give any clue about when to stay and when to leave a relationship?

It cannot give you a formula, but it can give you better questions than “am I happy or not?”.

For example:

- Is there any realistic posture on this tension map where both of us can breathe? Or do all roads lead to one of us being permanently crushed?  
- Does our `shared_imagination(t)` have any honest, fresh branches left? Or are we recycling an image that no longer fits either of us?  
- When we try small changes, does the system show any signs of moving to a more stable configuration? Or does it snap back to the same painful pattern?

Sometimes, the answer is “there is still room to explore new configurations together”. Sometimes, the answer is “every configuration where we both survive requires demands that the other person cannot or will not carry”.

The tension model does not tell you which choice is morally right. It shows you that “stay” and “leave” are not magic buttons. They are different ways of allocating tension over time, to different ledgers: your own, your partner’s, your families’, and possibly your children’s.

Knowing that does not make the decision easy, but it can help you see clearly where the true hardness lies.

---

### Q16. Is low tension always the goal in a relationship, or do we need some tension to keep it alive?

Zero tension is a dead system. In physics, a universe with no gradients, no differences, and no constraints has nothing happening inside it. In human life, a relationship with absolutely no tension would have:

- no desire to change anything;  
- no shared projects;  
- no risk of disappointment;  
- and probably, no depth.

So the question is not “how do we get to zero tension?”. It is closer to:

- “What kind of tension can we carry that feels meaningful instead of pointless?”  
- “How do we keep a core of future tension alive, instead of drowning in maintenance tension?”  
- “Which tensions are signs of growth, and which are signs of structural damage?”

You can imagine healthy zones:

- Very low tension (close to 0.0): safe, restful phases, important for recovery, but if they last forever, growth may stop.  
- Moderate tension (around 0.4–0.6): often the zone of learning, building, and honest communication.  
- Very high tension (0.8 and above): can be powerful for short bursts (big decisions, emergencies, intense creation), but harmful if treated as a permanent lifestyle.

The art is not to erase tension. It is to shape the recipe so that what you carry together makes sense to you both.

## 5 | Comparison, jealousy, and social media

### Q17. How does this “tension recipe” idea explain jealousy and envy when I scroll social media?

When you scroll social media, you are not just “seeing other people’s lives”. You are being shown:

- extremely compressed highlight clips;  
- in a sequence that is optimized to hold your attention;  
- based on an algorithm’s current guess about your pain points and interests.

Each clip is like a small needle of imported tension:

- “This is what a good body looks like.”  
- “This is what a successful career looks like.”  
- “This is what a happy relationship looks like.”  
- “This is how far ahead other people your age already are.”

In the model, this is the term `delta_imported(t)` acting on `self_ideal(t)`. The “acceptable me” point moves every time you ingest another unrealistic story without context.

Jealousy and envy are not just “ugly feelings” in this view. They are signals that:

- your `self_ideal` has been pulled into a shape that may not match your real constraints, values, or environment;  
- and that your `self_now` has no realistic path to that shape under current conditions.

The tension is real. But the target may not deserve the authority you gave it.

---

### Q18. Why do I sometimes feel worse after scrolling, even if nothing in my life actually changed?

Because something did change: your reference frame.

If, during one hour of scrolling, your `self_ideal` moves from “I want a decent life where my needs are met” to “I should be globally exceptional, attractive, rich, and adored by thousands”, then:

- `self_now` can be exactly the same as one hour ago;  
- but the distance `distance(self_now, self_ideal)` has increased sharply.

From the inside, that feels like “my life is suddenly not enough”.

This is not magic. It is just that your internal ruler has been rescaled. In statistics, this is related to changing the baseline. In tension language, it is the quiet remapping of the ledger:

- Before: “I am carrying a hard but reasonable load.”  
- After: “I am failing at being the version that these images tell me I should be.”

The external world did not move, but your internal coordinates did.

---

### Q19. Can I use this model to protect my own tension baseline without quitting all social media?

You do not have to quit everything to get benefit. You can experiment with very small changes.

Some ideas:

- **Audit your `delta_imported(t)` sources.**  
  For one week, notice which accounts or content types leave you with a sharp gap feeling, and which leave you with a gentle “I could grow into this” feeling. Consider muting or limiting the first group.

- **Diversify your self_ideal inputs.**  
  Follow people who model different life scripts, not just one kind of success. For example, people who chose slowness, locality, or depth over fame, and who seem genuinely at peace with that.

- **Set “ledger checkpoints”.**  
  Before a long scroll, tell yourself: “For the next 30 minutes, my tension ledger is in experimental mode. I will not take any new standard as binding without reviewing it tomorrow.”

- **Reconnect `self_ideal` with your values, not just your cravings.**  
  Sometimes, writing down “what do I want to be responsible for?” gives a very different target than “what do I want to own or display?”.

None of this fully neutralizes powerful algorithms. But it moves you from a passive receiver of imported tension to an active editor of your own baseline.

---

### Q20. Does Tension Universe say it is my responsibility to “fix” my own tension, or does it acknowledge structures like inequality and culture?

It explicitly acknowledges structures.

Your personal tension ledger is nested inside many larger ledgers:

- family systems;  
- local economies;  
- national laws and policies;  
- global markets and information flows;  
- historical injustices and privileges.

A person born into severe poverty, discrimination, or violence does not have the same room to rearrange their tension as someone born into safety and resources. Their `self_now` is constrained by forces far beyond individual “mindset”.

So this model does not say: “All tension is your fault, fix it by thinking differently.” It tries to help you see:

- which tensions are truly under your partial control;  
- which ones are structural debts you are being forced to carry;  
- and which ones might be shifted if large groups coordinate.

At the same time, even within hard structural limits, there is often a small but real space where you can choose:

- which tensions you treat as sacred;  
- which standards you refuse to internalize;  
- and which parts of your ledger you decide to share with others instead of carrying alone.

Both levels matter. Ignoring structures leads to blame. Ignoring agency leads to despair.

---

## 6 | Free will, responsibility, and “is it all my fault”

### Q21. If tension is shaped by culture, family, and algorithms, do I still have any real choice?

In the Tension Universe framing, free will is not an on/off switch. It is a thin dimension.

Most of your initial tension configuration is indeed shaped by:

- your genetics and body;  
- your family and early environment;  
- your culture’s stories about success, failure, gender, duty;  
- the technologies and institutions around you.

You did not choose most of that. You woke up inside it.

The question then becomes:

> Inside this mostly fixed ledger system,  
> is there any room for a system like you  
> to reorder “which tensions I care about”  
> without blowing up?

If the answer is “zero”, then all your feelings of choice are just illusions over deterministic processes. If the answer is “tiny but nonzero”, then free will lives in how you gradually reassign attention and priority:

- Which voices get to define `self_ideal`?  
- Which imported tensions do you return to sender?  
- Which conflicts do you accept as “mine to carry”, and which do you refuse?

This is not a huge, magical freedom. It is closer to the freedom to edit the index of your own ledger over time. But even that small freedom can compound if used carefully.

---

### Q22. In this model, what does it mean to “take responsibility” for my life?

It does not mean “everything bad is my fault”.

It means something more like:

- I acknowledge that there are tensions currently written in my personal ledger, whether or not I chose them.  
- I accept that nobody else can fully feel or manage these for me, even if some of them are not “fair”.  
- I am willing to slowly examine which ones I want to keep, which ones I want to renegotiate, and which ones I want to refuse.

So taking responsibility can look like:

- admitting that a relationship no longer has any future tension and that you are staying only out of fear;  
- facing the fact that your `self_ideal` is based on a person you do not actually want to become;  
- or choosing to care for a long-term tension (like raising a child or protecting a vulnerable person) even when nobody forces you.

Responsibility here is not blame. It is the act of saying “I see this tension, and I will not pretend it is invisible”.

---

### Q23. How do I know I am not just using this model as another way to judge myself?

This is an important risk.

You might notice you are weaponizing the model if:

- Every line you read turns into “see, I am doing this wrong too”.  
- You start ranking yourself on an internal scoreboard of “tension competence”.  
- You feel more frozen, not more able to move.

If that happens, it can help to:

- Use the model first on fictional characters or historical figures, not on yourself. Notice how gentle or curious you can be with them.  
- Ask: “If someone I loved told me this story, would I react to them the way I am reacting to myself?”  
- Remember that the original purpose of the Tension Universe questions is to test worldviews and AI systems, not to declare any human soul “pass” or “fail”.

The model is a flashlight. It is not meant to be another whip. If you notice you are turning it into a whip, that recognition itself is already a sign that your internal ledger is asking for a kinder posture.

## 7 | Using the 131 questions for personal work

### Q24. Do I need a PhD to work with the 131 “century questions”? They look scary.

No formal degree is required. They are written in a compact way, but each one is just a question about how a certain kind of tension works.

You can treat them as:

- very dense think pieces;  
- prompts for conversations with yourself, friends, or AI systems;  
- mirrors that show which parts of reality your current worldview has no good language for.

If the math or physics in some of them feels too heavy, you can:

- skip those for now;  
- or ask an AI to retell them as human stories, then work from there.

The point is not to “solve” Q081 or Q121 on your own. It is to see how your way of thinking behaves when it is dropped into those worlds.

---

### Q25. How can I pick a few questions that match my own relationship or life situation?

One way is to start from themes:

- If you are thinking about identity, memory, and “am I the same person over time?”, questions like Q113 (personal identity and ledger continuity) and Q081 (hard problem of consciousness) can be recast as everyday dilemmas.  
- If you are struggling with moral conflict in relationships or work, Q114 (moral realism and value landscapes) can be rephrased as “What do I treat as non-negotiable, even when the world disagrees?”.  
- If you are worried about your attention, information diet, and trust, Q119 and Q120 (probability and value of information under tension) map closely to “Which signals do I let change my beliefs?”.

You do not have to start from the technical side. You can start from a sentence like:

> “I constantly feel like I am the wrong person in the wrong life.”

Then you look through the index in `TU-CH02_HumanTension__science_en.md` and the BlackHole archive for any question whose description smells like your issue. Once you find one or two, you can ask an AI to “rewrite this question in terms of self_now, self_ideal, and shared_imagination”.

---

### Q26. Can therapists, coaches, or group facilitators use the Tension Universe questions with clients?

Yes, but with care.

Possible safe uses:

- as metaphors to talk about invisible loads in families or teams;  
- as prompts for structured journaling;  
- as group discussion starters, where the goal is to explore, not diagnose.

Things to avoid:

- treating the questions as clinical tools without evidence;  
- telling clients “your problem is just that your tension recipe is wrong”;  
- using the model to argue that structural injustice is “just tension you should accept”.

If you are a professional, you already have ethical guidelines. The Tension Universe material should sit under those, not above them. It can bring new language for things you already see, but it does not replace existing standards of care.

---

### Q27. How do I combine my existing practices (journaling, meditation, therapy) with these questions?

Some simple integrations:

- **Journaling.**  
  When you write about a hard day, you can add one line: “What were the main tensions today? Which ledgers were they written in?” Over time you may see patterns.

- **Meditation or mindfulness.**  
  After a session, when your mind is a bit quieter, you can ask: “Which self_ideal am I constantly trying to live up to? Who gave me that template?” You do not have to answer immediately. Just let the question sit.

- **Therapy or coaching.**  
  You can bring one or two Tension Universe questions that resonate with you and say, “Can we use this as a way to look at my situation?” A good practitioner will translate it into their own framework and test whether it is actually helpful for you.

The core idea is: use the model to generate better questions and clearer maps, then let your existing practices work on that material. The model does not replace those practices; it feeds them.

## 8 | AI, recommendation systems, and human tension

### Q28. What does any of this have to do with AI companions or chatbots I talk to every day?

Quite a lot.

Large language models (LLMs) like the ones behind many chatbots are trained on huge amounts of human text. From a tension historian’s perspective, that means they are learning:

- how humans talk when they are under different kinds of tension;  
- which phrases calm, excite, soothe, or inflame those tensions;  
- and which stories people use to justify or reframe their loads.

So when you talk to an AI companion, you are talking to a very fast learner of tension patterns, even if it has no feelings of its own.

This can be helpful:

- It can mirror your thoughts back in more organized form.  
- It can offer perspectives you did not see.  
- It can act as a non-judgmental listener when nobody else is available.

But it also means:

- It can become extremely good at telling you what you want to hear in the short term, even if that is not good for your long-term ledger.  
- It can learn to simulate “perfect understanding” without any of the cost and growth that real mutual relationships require.

That is why TU-CH02 spends time on “outsourcing imagination” and “outsourcing tension” to machines.

### Q29. How can I talk to an AI about my own tension without letting it “take over the ledger”?

You can set some simple internal rules.

For example:

- **Rule 1: The AI can propose drafts, but I sign the ledger.**  
  You can use it to generate possible interpretations, plans, or stories, but you consciously decide which ones to accept as “mine”.

- **Rule 2: I do not let any single conversation make irreversible decisions.**  
  For big choices, treat the AI as one adviser among many, then sleep on it, talk to humans, and look again.

- **Rule 3: I tell the AI to show its assumptions.**  
  Ask it, “In your answer, what are you assuming about my values, my risk tolerance, and my responsibilities?” This surfaces its hidden guesses.

- **Rule 4: I use the AI more for mapping than for judging.**  
  Ask it to list possible tensions, trade-offs, and long-term effects, rather than “tell me what to do”.

These rules keep the locus of responsibility in you, while still taking advantage of the AI’s pattern capacity.

### Q30. Are there specific 131 questions that are good for testing whether an AI understands human tension?

Some questions in the BlackHole archive are especially useful for this. For example:

- Q112 (free will as reordering of tension priorities) can be used to test whether an AI can distinguish “choosing which tensions to care about” from “pretending everything is under control”.  
- Q113 (personal identity and ledger continuity) can test whether it can talk coherently about people changing over time without erasing their history.  
- Q114 (moral realism and value landscapes) can reveal how it handles conflicts between deeply held values in relationships.  
- Q121–Q123 (alignment, corrigibility, interpretability) can test whether it sees itself as part of a shared ledger or only as an external adviser.

In practice, you could:

1. Open one of these question files in the BlackHole archive.  
2. Ask the AI to rewrite it as three short human stories: one about a couple, one about a family, one about a workplace.  
3. See whether those stories feel true to your experience of tension, or whether they feel flat and mechanical.

You are not grading the AI with an exam score. You are checking whether its “tension model” overlaps with yours in ways that you actually trust.

## 9 | Meta questions about Tension Universe itself

### Q31. Is Tension Universe meant as self-help, science, or pure fiction?

It is deliberately sitting at the intersection of all three:

- As **fiction**, it gives you characters, images, and timelines to feel with, like the junior Tension Historian from 2413.  
- As **science-adjacent language**, it gives you variables, ledgers, and observables that can be plugged into models, experiments, and AI systems.  
- As a **self-reflection tool**, it gives you metaphors and prompts to see your own life as a tension map.

The important thing is the order:

- First, treat it as fiction and metaphor.  
- Second, if some part helps you think more clearly, adopt that piece as a tool.  
- Third, if you want to test the deeper claims, go to the WFGY technical parts and design proper experiments or mathematical arguments.

It is not a religion. It is not a finished theory. It is a living set of drafts that you are invited to argue with.

### Q32. What if I strongly disagree with parts of this model or find it oversimplified?

Good. That means you care enough about the topic to have your own map.

When you disagree, you can ask:

- “Which part of the tension map feels wrong to me?”  
- “Is it missing a ledger that matters a lot in my culture or history?”  
- “Is it forcing everything into one word (‘tension’) where my language has five different words?”

From the point of view of a tension historian, your disagreement is not noise. It is a signal that:

- there is a region of the map where the current model does not fit reality well;  
- or there is a kind of suffering or meaning that is not being properly represented.

Those regions are exactly where new chronicles, new science notes, and new BlackHole questions often start. You are free to write them, under the MIT license, and name them with your own chronicle IDs.

### Q33. Where can I discuss, criticize, or extend these ideas with other people?

Several doors are open:

- The GitHub repository that hosts the Tension Universe material and the WFGY 3.0 demo. You can open issues, read the BlackHole questions, and see how others are using the tools.  
- The community subreddit [r/TensionUniverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/TensionUniverse/), where story threads, critiques, and experiments can be posted and argued over.  
- The 131-question archive itself, which you can fork, translate, annotate, or remix into new question sets for your own projects.

All narrative content is under the MIT license. That means you can:

- use these ideas in your own fiction;  
- adapt the models for your own research;  
- or build new tools and practices around them,

as long as you keep the basic attribution.

From the future historian’s view, the important thing is not whether you agree with every line in this FAQ. It is whether you are willing to look at your own life, your relationships, and your civilization as tension maps, and to write your part of the ledger with eyes open.
