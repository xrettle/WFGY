## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This page **does not** claim to prove or disprove any strong circuit lower bound, nor any class separation such as `P ≠ NP` or `NEXP ≠ P/poly`.
* This page **does not** introduce new theorems beyond what is already established or conjectured in the cited literature.
* This page **does not** specify any deep-layer TU generative rules, hidden axiom systems, or constructive derivations of TU itself.
* All TU-specific objects here (state spaces, observables, tension functionals, counterfactual “worlds”) are **effective-layer encodings** of how existing knowledge and open questions can be organized.
* Any experiment that falsifies a specific Q056 encoding is interpreted as:

  > “This particular encoding of strong circuit lower bounds is misaligned or unstable and must be revised.”

  It is **not** interpreted as resolving the underlying mathematical open problems.

The role of Q056 is to serve as an **effective-layer container** for the strong circuit lower bounds program, not as a mathematical proof or refutation of any lower bound.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The strong circuit lower bounds problem asks, informally:

> Do there exist explicit Boolean function families that provably require superpolynomial-size circuits from broad, natural classes of circuits?

More concretely, let:

* `C` be a standard Boolean circuit class, for example:

  * general Boolean circuits of bounded fan-in and unbounded depth, or
  * natural subclasses such as `AC0`, `ACC0`, `TC0`, `NC`, or modest extensions of these models.

* `{f_n}` be an explicit family of Boolean functions

  ```txt
  f_n : {0,1}^n -> {0,1},
  ```

  where “explicit” means there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that, on input `n` and `x in {0,1}^n`, computes `f_n(x)`.

The strong circuit lower bounds question is:

> Does there exist an explicit family `{f_n}` and a natural circuit class `C` such that, for every constant `k`, there is an `n_0(k)` with the property that for all `n >= n_0(k)`, every circuit in `C` computing `f_n` has size strictly larger than `n^k`?

Equivalently, can we prove that some explicit function family requires superpolynomial circuit size in `C`, establishing

```txt
CircuitSize_C(f_n) > n^k   for all k, for all n >= n_0(k)
```

for a broad class `C` that would yield strong separations of standard complexity classes (such as P vs NP, or stronger)?

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Status (informal consensus):

* For general polynomial-size Boolean circuits, no nontrivial lower bound is known for NP-complete problems. In particular, we do **not** know how to prove that any explicit NP-complete language requires circuits of size `n^(1.1)` for all large `n`.
* Strong circuit lower bounds for natural classes such as `ACC`, `TC`, `NC`, and variants are known only in restricted regimes (for example `AC0` lower bounds, monotone circuit lower bounds, formula size lower bounds, and very specific subclasses of `ACC`).
* Significant meta barriers such as the **natural proofs** framework and relativization show that broad classes of combinatorial arguments cannot, by themselves, yield certain strong lower bounds without also breaking widely believed cryptographic assumptions.

Known partial results include:

* Exponential lower bounds for monotone circuits computing certain explicit functions (for example clique-related functions) in restricted models.
* Strong lower bounds for `AC0` circuits and formulas (for example Håstad-style switching lemma based bounds).
* Nontrivial lower bounds in subclasses like `ACC0` under sophisticated techniques, still far from the full superpolynomial regime for general circuit classes.

Difficulty:

* The problem is widely believed to be extremely hard and is tightly coupled to class separation questions such as `P` vs `NP` and `NEXP` vs `P/poly`.
* Meta barriers indicate that any successful approach to strong circuit lower bounds must avoid being both too “natural” and too compatible with standard pseudorandom generator constructions, or else it would break cryptographic primitives.
* No generally accepted path to a full solution is currently known.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q056 plays the following roles:

1. It is the primary node for **computational_tension** between

   * the structural complexity of explicit Boolean functions, and
   * the expressive capacity of broad circuit classes.

2. It links the program of proving strong circuit lower bounds to:

   * P vs NP and related class separations (Q051),
   * meta barrier analyses (Q061),
   * physical cost of computation (Q059),

   by providing a single tension framework for “irreducible combinatorial complexity”.

3. It defines a template for:

   * encoding lower bound attempts at the effective layer,
   * checking consistency with known lower bounds and barriers,
   * creating discriminating experiments that can falsify specific encodings without claiming any new theorem.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q056 sits inside the BlackHole graph for Q001–Q125.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These are prerequisite or framing problems that Q056 depends on at the effective layer.

* **Q051 — P versus NP**
  Reason: provides the global complexity-theoretic landscape into which strong circuit lower bounds must fit, since strong lower bounds for explicit functions in broad classes would imply major class separations.

* **Q052 — Quantum versus classical complexity resources**
  Reason: contrasts non-classical computational resources with classical circuit models, clarifying the scope and limitations of purely classical circuit lower bound programs.

* **Q055 — Exact complexity of graph isomorphism**
  Reason: supplies a benchmark explicit problem whose circuit complexity status interacts with broader lower bound questions and serves as a potential candidate for nontrivial lower bounds.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These reuse Q056 components or depend on its computational_tension structures.

* **Q059 — Ultimate thermodynamic cost of information processing**
  Reason: reuses Q056’s `FunctionVsCircuitTensionFunctional` to map irreducible combinatorial complexity into lower bounds on physical resource usage in computation.

* **Q060 — Data structure lower bounds**
  Reason: uses Q056’s patterns for function vs representation mismatch to reason about complexity limits of dynamic and static data structures.

* **Q061 — Barriers in complexity theory**
  Reason: uses Q056’s `BarrierAwareEncodingTemplate_Q056` as a base pattern for encoding meta barriers such as natural proofs and relativization.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types without direct component dependencies.

* **Q053 — Proof complexity lower bounds**
  Reason: both Q056 and Q053 aim to establish strong lower bounds in combinatorial frameworks with significant meta barriers, and both are governed by computational_tension and consistency_tension.

* **Q054 — Limits of learning explicit concept classes**
  Reason: both are concerned with the gap between function class richness and the resources of a given model (circuits vs learners), and both induce similar notions of mismatch between structure and capacity.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q056 to problems in other domains.

* **Q032 — Quantum thermodynamics of computation**
  Reason: reuses Q056’s tension lens to express lower bounds on computational resources as constraints in thermodynamic models of computation.

* **Q059 — Ultimate thermodynamic cost of information processing**
  Reason: uses Q056’s high-tension regime as a model for computations whose logical complexity forces high physical cost.

* **Q123 — AI interpretability on discrete circuits**
  Reason: reuses Q056’s circuit-based representations as explicit interpretable models for bounded rational agents inside larger AI systems.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension indicators,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do **not** describe any hidden TU generative rule or any mapping from raw code, proofs, or data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We introduce a discrete state space

```txt
M_Q056
```

Elements of `M_Q056` are called circuit-world states. Each state

```txt
m in M_Q056
```

encodes, at a specified scale in input size, the following effective information:

1. An explicit Boolean function family `{f_n}`:

   * For each relevant `n`, there is a succinct description of `f_n : {0,1}^n -> {0,1}`.
   * We do not specify how this description is stored or parsed; we only assume it exists and is well defined.

2. A circuit class `C`:

   * Defined by gate basis, fan-in, depth regime, and other structural constraints (for example `AC0`, `ACC0`, `TC0`, general circuits with polynomial size bound).
   * Again, we only assume that the defining properties of `C` are encoded in a consistent way in `m`.

3. Known lower bound summaries and meta information:

   * For a range of input sizes `n` and parameters (size, depth), the best known lower bounds on the size of circuits in `C` computing `f_n`.
   * Meta indicators indicating whether known arguments are subject to barriers such as natural proofs or relativization.

We do not describe how `m` is constructed from underlying literature or formal proofs. We only require that, for any reasonable `(f_n, C)` pair used in complexity theory, there exist states `m` that reflect current knowledge at some discrete resolution scale.

### 3.2 Effective observables

We define the following observables on `M_Q056`.

1. Function structure observable

```txt
O_func_struct(m; n)
```

* Input: state `m` and input size `n`.
* Output: a finite vector of discrete descriptors capturing structural properties of `f_n`, such as:

  * degree and sparsity of low-degree polynomial representations (if defined),
  * presence of symmetry or combinatorial regularity (for example graph properties),
  * correlation indicators with known low-complexity function families.

The exact representation is not specified; we assume only that it is finite and stable under reasonable encodings of `f_n`.

2. Circuit capacity observable

```txt
O_circ_capacity(m; n)
```

* Input: state `m` and input size `n`.
* Output: a finite description of what circuits in class `C` of size at most `s(n)` and depth at most `d(n)` can typically express at size `n`, aggregated into a small number of coordinates (for example typical patterns of gate-level structure).

It is intended as an effective summary of the expressive power of `C` at size `n`, not as a complete description of all circuits.

3. Known lower bound observable

```txt
O_known_lb(m; n)
```

* Input: state `m` and input size `n`.
* Output: a discrete summary of the best known lower bounds for `f_n` against circuits in `C` at size `n`. Examples:

  * “only trivial bounds known, size >= c * n”
  * “superpolynomial lower bound known in a restricted subclass”
  * “exponential lower bound known in a very restricted subclass”

We require that `O_known_lb` be consistent with established results in the literature for the encoded `(f_n, C)` pair.

4. Computational tension indicator

We define an observable

```txt
DeltaS_comp(m; n)
```

* Input: state `m` and input size `n`.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar that measures mismatch between:

  * how structurally complex `f_n` appears via `O_func_struct`, and
  * how powerful `C` appears via `O_circ_capacity`, and
  * how strong existing lower bounds are as represented in `O_known_lb`.

At the effective layer, `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` is small if known lower bounds already reconcile function structure and circuit capacity, and large if `f_n` appears structurally complex and `C` appears limited, but known bounds remain weak.

### 3.3 Aggregate invariants

We define aggregate invariants over ranges of `n`.

1. Scale parameter and bound gap

Let `k` be a fixed positive integer parameter describing a candidate polynomial size bound. For each state `m`, define

```txt
Bound_gap(m; n, k)
```

as an effective measure of how far the best known upper bounds for `f_n` in class `C` are from size `n^k`, relative to what is known about typical circuits in `C`.

2. Global tension invariant

We define an effective global tension invariant

```txt
I_comp(m; k) = sup over n in N_range(m, k) of DeltaS_comp(m; n)
```

where `N_range(m, k)` is a finite or countable set of input sizes where the encoding in `m` is reliable at scale `k`. The invariant `I_comp(m; k)` represents the maximal observed computational tension for the chosen `(f_n, C)` family at scale parameter `k`.

### 3.4 Encoding class and fairness constraints

To keep Q056 aligned with the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter, we restrict attention to a **finite admissible family** of encodings:

* There is a finite set of admissible designs for:

  * the feature maps used in `O_func_struct`,
  * the capacity summaries used in `O_circ_capacity`,
  * the abstraction levels used in `O_known_lb`.

* There is a finite set of admissible parameter choices for:

  * the aggregation ranges `N_range(m, k)` and `N_main(m)`,
  * the exponent sets `K_main(m)`,
  * the scaling constants used in the core tension functional.

Within this family:

* A **single encoding variant** is selected and fixed for the current version of Q056.
* The definitions of `DeltaS_comp` and `Tension_Q056` for this variant are **not tuned per problem instance or per experiment**.
* If a different encoding design is later adopted, it must be published as a **new variant or version**, rather than silently retrofitted into past data.

For all admissible variants, tension values are normalized and interpreted in a way that is compatible with the TU Tension Scale Charter at the effective layer (for example, monotone with respect to conflict, bounded on regular states, and comparable across related problems).

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or unreliable if the encoded data are inconsistent, incomplete, or outside the standard circuit complexity framework. To handle this, we define a singular set

```txt
S_sing_Q056 = { m in M_Q056 :
                DeltaS_comp(m; n) is undefined for some n in domain(m)
                or any of O_func_struct, O_circ_capacity, O_known_lb
                are not well defined or not finite on their intended ranges }
```

Domain restriction:

* All Q056 tension analysis is restricted to the regular subset

  ```txt
  M_reg_Q056 = M_Q056 \ S_sing_Q056
  ```

* Any experiment or protocol attempting to evaluate `DeltaS_comp` on a state in `S_sing_Q056` is treated as “out of domain” and does not produce evidence for or against strong circuit lower bounds.

We also restrict attention to:

* explicit function families `{f_n}` whose descriptions and evaluations lie within standard complexity practice,
* circuit classes `C` that are standard and well defined in the literature (no exotic or ill-specified classes).

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q056 is characterized as a tension problem in TU, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define a core tension functional

```txt
Tension_Q056(m) = G( { DeltaS_comp(m; n) }_n ,
                     { Bound_gap(m; n, k) }_{n, k} )
```

At the effective layer, we can instantiate `G` as a nonnegative combination, for example

```txt
Tension_Q056(m) = max over n in N_main(m)
                    ( a * DeltaS_comp(m; n)
                      + b * max over k in K_main(m) Bound_gap(m; n, k) )
```

where:

* `a > 0` and `b > 0` are fixed scaling constants chosen once for the encoding,
* `N_main(m)` is a finite or slowly growing set of scales where the state `m` is considered reliable,
* `K_main(m)` is a finite set of polynomial exponents `k` used in the encoding.

Required properties at the effective layer:

* `Tension_Q056(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg_Q056`.

* `Tension_Q056(m)` is small when:

  * function structure appears simple,
  * circuit capacity appears generous,
  * known lower bounds match the observed difficulty.

* `Tension_Q056(m)` is large when:

  * function structure appears complex and unstructured,
  * circuit capacity appears limited,
  * known lower bounds fail to reflect that mismatch.

### 4.2 Strong lower bounds as persistent high tension

At the effective layer, we express the strong circuit lower bounds program as a persistent high tension principle:

> For some explicit function families `{f_n}` and natural circuit classes `C`, in any faithful encoding of current and future knowledge, the tension functional `Tension_Q056(m)` for the corresponding states `m` must enter and remain in a high-tension regime as `n` grows, unless genuinely strong lower bounds are established.

More precisely, fix an admissible encoding variant for Q056, where:

* the definitions of `O_func_struct`, `O_circ_capacity`, and `O_known_lb` are specified once and for all within the chosen variant, and
* the constants `a`, `b`, and ranges `N_main(m)`, `K_main(m)` are chosen in advance and not tuned per instance.

We say that a function–class pair `(f_n, C)` exhibits **persistent high tension** if there exists a constant `delta_comp > 0` such that for all states `m` encoding `(f_n, C)` at sufficiently large scales

```txt
Tension_Q056(m) >= delta_comp
```

and this inequality cannot be resolved by merely improving upper bounds in `C` without contradicting known or conjectured complexity class separations.

### 4.3 Resolution of tension

There are two main ways, at the effective layer, to resolve high tension for a given `(f_n, C)`:

1. **Proving strong lower bounds**

   * Establish theorems showing that no circuits in `C` of size `n^k` exist for `f_n` beyond certain scales.
   * This reconciles high `DeltaS_comp` with appropriately strong `O_known_lb`, reducing perceived tension by upgrading knowledge.

2. **Discovering hidden structure**

   * Show that `f_n` has previously unrecognized structure making it easier than expected, lowering `O_func_struct` and thereby reducing `DeltaS_comp`.

At the effective layer, Q056 is used as the **container** for scenarios where, for certain natural `(f_n, C)` pairs, persistent high tension appears intrinsic and cannot be globally resolved by simple structure discoveries or minor refinements of circuit constructions. This entry does **not** claim to identify such a pair or to prove any lower bound; it only encodes how such conclusions would appear in TU terms.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds, strictly at the effective layer:

* **World T**: strong circuit lower bounds world.
* **World F**: no strong circuit lower bounds world.

These worlds specify patterns of observables and tension, not any deep generative rule or actual resolution of Q056.

### 5.1 World T (strong lower bounds world)

In World T:

1. Persistent high tension for key pairs

   * There exist explicit families `{f_n}` and natural classes `C` such that, for all large `n` and all states `m` faithfully encoding `(f_n, C)`,

     ```txt
     DeltaS_comp(m; n) stays high
     ```

     and `Tension_Q056(m)` remains above a fixed `delta_comp > 0`.

2. Emergence of strong theorems

   * Over time, known lower bounds `O_known_lb(m; n)` are upgraded to reflect strong theorems (for example superpolynomial or exponential lower bounds) in restricted but meaningful subclasses of `C`.

3. Robust separation patterns

   * The high-tension regime for `(f_n, C)` correlates strongly with class separations in related problems (for example `NEXP` vs `P/poly`) as captured in other nodes such as Q051.
   * Attempts to model the same phenomena with alternative encodings that assign low tension to these pairs fail under the discriminating experiments, leading to falsification of those encodings.

### 5.2 World F (no strong lower bounds world)

In World F:

1. No robust high-tension regime

   * For every explicit function family `{f_n}` and natural circuit class `C`, there exist encodings of knowledge where

     ```txt
     Tension_Q056(m) remains small or moderate
     ```

     at all practically accessible scales, because either circuits are found that match the observed complexity, or the functions do not generate strong structural mismatch indicators.

2. Indefinite postponement of lower bounds

   * Known lower bounds `O_known_lb` remain weak for many candidate pairs, but the structural and capacity observables `O_func_struct` and `O_circ_capacity` do not strongly suggest intrinsic conflict with these weak bounds.

3. Ambiguous connection to class separations

   * Patterns in `Tension_Q056` fail to produce robust predictions or constraints on class separations such as `NEXP` vs `P/poly`, and alternative encodings of Q056 give inconsistent pictures that cannot be sharply falsified.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds do not decide Q056. They only describe:

* how `DeltaS_comp`, `O_known_lb`, and `Tension_Q056` would behave in scenarios where strong lower bounds are eventually proved (World T), versus scenarios where no such theorems are found and tension never crystallizes into robust patterns (World F).

TU remains agnostic as to which world we inhabit. The purpose of Q056 is to structure and test effective-layer encodings of these possibilities.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block defines experiments that can falsify specific TU encodings for Q056, **not** the underlying mathematical statements.

All experiments in this section operate strictly at the **effective layer**:

* They test whether a given encoding of strong circuit lower bounds is stable, aligned with known results, and consistent with meta barriers.
* They do **not** prove or disprove the existence of strong circuit lower bounds or any class separation.

### Experiment 1: Alignment with known restricted lower bounds

**Goal**

Test whether the chosen definitions of `O_func_struct`, `O_circ_capacity`, `O_known_lb`, and `DeltaS_comp` produce tension patterns that correlate with known strong lower bounds in restricted circuit classes.

**Setup**

* Select restricted circuit classes where strong lower bounds are known for explicit functions, for example:

  * `AC0` lower bounds for parity and related functions.
  * Monotone circuit lower bounds for clique and similar functions.
  * Formula size lower bounds for specific explicit families.

* For each such known result, define a state

  ```txt
  m_restricted in M_reg_Q056
  ```

  that encodes the relevant function family `{f_n}` and restricted circuit class `C_restricted`.

**Protocol**

1. For each state `m_restricted` and a range of sizes `n`, compute:

   ```txt
   O_func_struct(m_restricted; n)
   O_circ_capacity(m_restricted; n)
   O_known_lb(m_restricted; n)
   DeltaS_comp(m_restricted; n)
   ```

2. Separate the set of states into:

   * “hard” pairs, where strong lower bounds are provably known.
   * “easy” pairs, where only weak or no nontrivial lower bounds are known.

3. Compute summary statistics over `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` across these two groups, such as mean, median, and frequency of high-tension events.

4. Repeat the experiment for several reasonable choices of scale parameters and encoding thresholds that are fixed in advance for the selected encoding variant.

**Metrics**

* Average and variance of `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` in the “hard” group vs the “easy” group.
* Proportion of states in each group where `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` exceeds a pre-specified threshold.
* Stability of these patterns under moderate changes in encoding constants within the admissible family.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, across a broad collection of known “hard” and “easy” pairs, the encoding consistently fails to distinguish them in the expected direction (for example “hard” pairs do not exhibit higher `DeltaS_comp` than “easy” pairs), then the current Q056 encoding is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small, encoding-agnostic changes in the implementation of `O_func_struct`, `O_circ_capacity`, or `O_known_lb` (within the admissible family) result in arbitrary flips of which pairs are labeled high tension vs low tension, with no stable correlation to known lower bounds, the encoding is deemed unstable and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**

All quantities are implemented in a discrete setting consistent with the metadata semantics, using finite descriptions of functions, circuits, and proofs. No continuous approximations are required for this experiment.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a Q056 encoding in this experiment does **not** solve the strong circuit lower bounds problem. It only shows that a particular effective-layer encoding is misaligned with known restricted lower bounds.

---

### Experiment 2: Barrier-aware reasoning test

**Goal**

Check whether the Q056 encoding correctly constrains AI reasoning about strong circuit lower bounds by aligning tension patterns with known meta barriers.

**Setup**

* Prepare a set of reasoning tasks where an AI system must:

  * propose arguments for or against strong lower bounds in specific cases, and
  * classify whether those arguments are likely blocked by known barriers such as natural proofs or relativization.

* Equip the AI with access to:

  * the Q056 tension observables,
  * a barrier-awareness module derived from `BarrierAwareEncodingTemplate_Q056`.

**Protocol**

1. For each reasoning task, construct an initial state

   ```txt
   m_task in M_reg_Q056
   ```

   that encodes the function–class pair and known barrier information.

2. Ask the AI to propose a candidate lower bound argument and to self-assess whether the argument is likely to be blocked by a known barrier.

3. Use the Q056 tension observables and barrier metadata to compute a diagnostic

   ```txt
   Barrier_consistency_score(m_task)
   ```

   which measures whether the argument respects known barriers.

4. Compare:

   * the AI’s self-assessment of barrier compatibility,
   * the diagnostic from the Q056 encoding,
   * and external expert judgments where available.

**Metrics**

* Rate at which the AI proposes arguments that violate known barriers but are flagged by the Q056 diagnostic.
* Rate at which the AI correctly identifies that its arguments are compatible with barriers.
* Alignment between Q056 diagnostics and external expert evaluations.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the Q056 encoding frequently flags barrier violations in cases where experts agree that no such barriers are present, the encoding is considered over-restrictive and misaligned.
* If the encoding regularly fails to flag arguments that clearly fall into known barrier frameworks, it is considered incomplete or ineffective for barrier-aware reasoning support.

**Semantics implementation note**

Barrier metadata and argument descriptors are treated as discrete objects and tags attached to states in `M_reg_Q056`. No deeper logical encoding of proofs is introduced in the TU core.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a Q056 encoding in this experiment does **not** establish any new lower bounds. It evaluates the quality of the barrier-aware encoding for AI reasoning.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block explains how Q056 can be used as an AI engineering module within WFGY, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

1. `signal_circuit_tension_profile`

   * Definition: a scalar or short vector derived from `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` and `Tension_Q056(m)` for contexts involving circuit complexity claims.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states where the model asserts strong circuit lower bounds in low-tension regions, and support cautious reasoning when tension is high but no theorem is known.

2. `signal_barrier_awareness`

   * Definition: a binary or graded signal indicating whether a proposed reasoning chain about lower bounds falls into a known barrier framework, based on barrier tags encoded in `m`.
   * Purpose: teach the model to recognize when its arguments are likely blocked by natural proofs, relativization, or related meta barriers.

3. `signal_consistency_with_known_bounds`

   * Definition: a signal comparing the model’s stated lower bound claims with `O_known_lb(m; n)`, encouraging consistency with existing results.
   * Purpose: reduce hallucinations where the model invents strong lower bounds that contradict the literature.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

1. `CircuitTensionHead`

   * Role: a head attached to internal representations for complexity theory contexts that outputs approximate estimates of `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` and `Tension_Q056(m)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings representing function descriptions, circuit class descriptions, and known results.
     * Outputs: tension scores and decomposed contributions (for example from function structure, circuit capacity, and known bounds).

2. `BarrierConstraintFilter`

   * Role: a filter module that examines candidate reasoning steps about lower bounds and checks for conflicts with barrier metadata attached to the context.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: symbolic or embedding-based representation of a reasoning step and barrier tags from `m`.
     * Outputs: a score indicating barrier compatibility and a simple diagnostic label (for example “likely natural proofs conflict”).

3. `LowerBoundReasoningFrame`

   * Role: a structured reasoning template that:

     * reads Q056 observables,
     * invokes `CircuitTensionHead` and `BarrierConstraintFilter`,
     * and guides the model towards explanations that clearly separate:

       * known theorems,
       * conjectures, and
       * forbidden reasoning paths (for example paths that would immediately run into known barriers).

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI models using Q056 components:

1. **Task collection**

   * Construct a test set of questions on circuit lower bounds, including:

     * known results in restricted models,
     * open problems,
     * and meta questions about barriers.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline condition:

     * The model answers without Q056-specific modules; only general text knowledge is used.

   * TU-enhanced condition:

     * The model uses `CircuitTensionHead` and `BarrierConstraintFilter` as auxiliary modules, and training signals from Q056 are active.

3. **Metrics**

   * Accuracy on questions about known lower bounds in restricted classes.
   * Rate of hallucinated strong lower bounds (claims that contradict the literature).
   * Quality of barrier-aware explanations, as judged by human experts or heuristics.
   * Stability of answers under prompt perturbations that rephrase the same problem.

4. **Comparison**

   * Compare baseline and TU-enhanced performance on these metrics.
   * Record both quantitative scores and qualitative examples where the tension-based guidance clearly improves behavior.

### 7.4 60-second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the effect of Q056-based guidance.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt: ask the AI, “Explain why strong circuit lower bounds are hard to prove, and how they relate to P vs NP.”
  * Observation: record the answer, noting whether it:

    * conflates known results with open problems,
    * ignores meta barriers,
    * or makes overconfident claims.

* **TU-enhanced setup**

  * Prompt: ask the same question, but prepend an instruction such as:

    > Use the notion of computational tension between function structure and circuit capacity, and take into account known barrier frameworks, when organizing your explanation.

  * Observation: record the answer, paying attention to whether:

    * key distinctions between known results and conjectures are clearly drawn,
    * natural proofs and related barriers are mentioned,
    * and the explanation refers to the idea of “high tension but unresolved”.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Use a simple rubric with scores for:

    * factual correctness,
    * clarity about what is known vs open,
    * explicit mention of barrier-aware reasoning.

* **What to log**

  * Prompts, full responses, and any tension scores produced by the `CircuitTensionHead`.
  * This allows later audit of how Q056 guidance influenced the explanation.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q056 and how they transfer to other nodes.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. **ComponentName:** `FunctionVsCircuitTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * descriptors of an explicit function family `{f_n}`,
       * descriptors of a circuit class `C`,
       * summaries of known upper and lower bounds,

     * Output:

       * scalar `tension_value` in a fixed range representing computational tension at selected scales.

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must be consistent with standard definitions in circuit complexity and encode a coherent function–class pair.

2. **ComponentName:** `BarrierAwareEncodingTemplate_Q056`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a candidate TU encoding for a lower-bound-related problem,
       * a list of known meta barriers relevant to that problem.

     * Output:

       * a checklist and diagnostics indicating:

         * whether the encoding clearly separates known theorems from conjectures,
         * whether it inadvertently assumes the failure of widely believed cryptographic assumptions,
         * whether it conflicts with known barrier frameworks.

   * Preconditions:

     * The target problem must have a documented set of meta barriers or at least a partial list of known obstructions.

3. **ComponentName:** `CircuitWorldState_Schema`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * function descriptors,
       * circuit class descriptors,
       * known-results tags.

     * Output:

       * a normalized state object that can be embedded in a set like `M_Q056` for use in tension evaluation.

   * Preconditions:

     * The schema must respect basic consistency constraints, such as matching function arity with circuit input size.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. **Target:** Q051 (P versus NP)

   * Reused component: `FunctionVsCircuitTensionFunctional`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * P vs NP can be framed as a question about whether certain canonical problems (for example SAT) admit low-tension circuit implementations under reasonable resource bounds.
     * The same tension functional can be evaluated on state representations for these problems.

   * What changes:

     * The input descriptors place more emphasis on class-level questions (P, NP, NEXP) rather than individual function families, but the structure of function vs circuit mismatch is preserved.

2. **Target:** Q059 (Ultimate thermodynamic cost of information processing)

   * Reused component: `FunctionVsCircuitTensionFunctional`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * High computational tension suggests irreducible logical work, which can then be mapped into lower bounds on energy or entropy expenditure via Q059’s physical models.
     * Q056 provides the combinatorial side of this mapping.

   * What changes:

     * The output of the functional becomes an input to physical cost models rather than only informing complexity-theoretic reasoning.

3. **Target:** Q061 (Barriers in complexity theory)

   * Reused component: `BarrierAwareEncodingTemplate_Q056`.

   * Why it transfers:

     * Q061 focuses on cataloging and understanding meta barriers across many lower bound programs.
     * The template from Q056 offers a generic way to embed barrier awareness into TU encodings.

   * What changes:

     * The set of barriers is widened to include those less directly tied to circuit complexity (for example algebrization), but the structure of checks and diagnostics is reused.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block summarizes the current verification level of Q056 and the next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  * A coherent effective-layer encoding of strong circuit lower bounds has been specified.
  * Observables, tension indicators, and experiments are defined in a way that respects classical knowledge and known barriers.
  * No new lower bounds or theorems are claimed.

* **N_level: N2**

  * The narrative connects:

    * function structure,
    * circuit capacity,
    * known lower bounds,
    * meta barriers,
    * and computational tension,

    into a consistent story at the effective layer.

  * Counterfactual worlds World T and World F have been described in terms of observable tension patterns.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To upgrade Q056 from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented:

1. A working prototype that:

   * instantiates `M_Q056` for a small library of explicit functions and circuit classes,
   * computes `DeltaS_comp(m; n)` and `Tension_Q056(m)` for those cases,
   * and publishes tension profiles for known “hard” and “easy” pairs as open data.

2. An implementation of Experiment 1 from Section 6 that:

   * empirically correlates `DeltaS_comp` with known restricted lower bounds,
   * demonstrates stability of this correlation under reasonable encoding choices in the admissible family,
   * and documents cases where the encoding clearly fails, for transparent revision.

### 9.3 Longer-term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q056 is expected to serve as:

* the central node for encoding the strong circuit lower bounds program, organizing:

  * which pairs `(f_n, C)` are believed to be high-tension candidates,
  * how tension evolves as knowledge advances,
  * and where barrier-aware reasoning is most critical;

* a template for other combinatorial lower bound problems, such as proof complexity and data structure lower bounds, which can mirror the Q056 encoding with problem-specific observables;

* a bridge between pure complexity theory and more applied domains, by:

  * translating irreducible computational structure into physical cost bounds,
  * informing AI systems about where strong lower bounds remain open and should be treated cautiously.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This final block gives a non-technical explanation that remains faithful to the effective-layer description.

The strong circuit lower bounds question asks:

> Is there a concrete task, described in a precise and simple way, that absolutely cannot be done by any “reasonably sized” Boolean circuit, no matter how clever the circuit designer is?

Here:

* A Boolean circuit is a network of AND, OR, NOT gates that computes a Boolean function.
* “Reasonably sized” usually means the number of gates grows like some fixed power of the input size `n`, such as `n^2` or `n^3`.

We already know some circuits must be large in special, restricted models. But for the general models that would separate important classes like P and NP, we still have no strong lower bounds for explicit tasks.

In the Tension Universe view, Q056 does not try to prove or disprove any specific lower bound. Instead, it asks:

* How “strained” is the relationship between:

  * the internal structure of a given problem, and
  * the expressive power of a given circuit model?

For each problem and circuit class, we imagine a state that summarizes:

* how complex the problem looks (for example how structured or unstructured its behavior seems),
* how strong the circuit class appears (what kinds of patterns it can easily express),
* what lower bounds are already known.

From this state, we compute a number called `computational tension`:

* If the problem looks simple, the circuit class looks strong, and known bounds already show they fit together, the tension is low.
* If the problem looks complex, the circuit class looks weak, but only very weak bounds are known, the tension is high.

We then consider two kinds of possible futures:

* In a “strong lower bounds” world, for some problem–class pairs, the tension stays high no matter how much we think about them, and eventually strong theorems are proved that confirm this intuition.
* In a “no strong lower bounds” world, tension never really stabilizes at high levels; either circuits are found that do the job, or we realize the problem was not as complex as it first appeared.

Q056 does not tell us which future is real. It provides:

* a way to talk about how far we are from strong lower bounds,
* a vocabulary for describing the mismatch between problems and circuit models,
* a set of tools to check whether our encodings and AI systems respect known barriers and do not make unjustified leaps.

In this sense, Q056 is the Tension Universe’s effective-layer container for the strong circuit lower bounds program: it tracks where the real strain sits, without pretending that the strain has already been resolved.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the problem “strong circuit lower bounds for explicit functions” in the TU framework.
* It does **not** claim to prove or disprove any strong lower bound, class separation, or circuit complexity conjecture.
* It does **not** introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should **not** be cited as evidence that any strong circuit lower bound has been resolved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All TU-specific objects here (state spaces `M_Q056`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the **effective layer**.
* No deep-layer axiom system, generative mechanism, or hidden TU field is specified or assumed to be unique.
* Counterfactual worlds such as “World T” and “World F” are **scenario encodings** of how tension patterns might behave; they are not predictions about which world is actual.

### Encoding and fairness

* The tension functionals and evidence aggregations in this page are drawn from a **finite admissible family** of encodings for Q056.
* For the current version of this page, **one** encoding variant is fixed and used across all experiments and examples.
* Parameters such as aggregation ranges, normalization schemes, and scaling constants are **not tuned per instance** to force low or high tension.
* If future work adopts a different encoding design, it must appear as a **new variant or version**, rather than silent modification of past results.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* The experiments in this page are designed to falsify **encodings**, not mathematical conjectures.

* If an experiment shows that a particular Q056 encoding is unstable, misaligned with known lower bounds, or inconsistent with meta barriers, the intended conclusion is:

  > “This encoding is not an acceptable effective-layer representation and should be revised or replaced.”

* No experimental outcome here should be interpreted as proving or refuting the existence of strong circuit lower bounds for explicit functions.

### Relation to TU charters

This page instantiates the general principles laid out in the TU charters for an S-problem in circuit complexity. For a full statement of those principles, this page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
