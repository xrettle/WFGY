# Contribute to Tension Universe

Tension Universe is not a closed document set.

It is an expanding experimental field built around a growing structure of ideas, tests, and MVP pages. Some parts are already written, some are partially drafted, and many are still open.

This space is open to AI developers, researchers, builders, and early contributors who want to help turn unfinished ideas into clear, standalone experiment pages.

## Why this exists

The long term structure currently points toward a 131 experiment field.

Not every experiment is complete yet.

Instead of waiting until everything is finished internally, this project keeps the field open so that early contributors can help shape it in public, one page at a time.

Each experiment is intended to be simple at the MVP level:

- one idea
- one page
- one minimal structure
- one readable claim
- one experiment direction that can be extended later

That means contribution does not require writing a full theory from day one. A clear and useful MVP page is enough.

## What you can contribute

You can contribute by taking one open experiment and turning it into a minimal, standalone markdown page.

A good contribution usually does the following:

- defines the experiment clearly
- explains the core idea in plain language
- states what the experiment is trying to test, show, or challenge
- keeps the scope readable and structured
- stays aligned with the broader Tension Universe direction

The goal is not perfection.

The goal is to move unfinished ideas into visible, usable, discussable MVP form.

## Minimum acceptable MVP

A contribution can be accepted as an MVP if it meets the following baseline:

1. It has a clear title.
2. It presents one understandable experiment idea.
3. It includes a minimal claim or purpose.
4. It is readable as a standalone page.
5. It stays consistent with the Tension Universe theme and direction.

You do not need to solve everything in one submission.

A strong first version is better than an overbuilt draft that never gets finished.

## Submission path

There are two simple ways to contribute:

### Option 1

Open an issue first, claim an open experiment, and then submit your draft.

This is the cleanest path if you want to avoid overlap with someone else.

### Option 2

Submit a pull request directly with a new experiment page.

This works well if the scope is small and the draft is already ready.

In both cases, keeping the contribution minimal, clear, and focused will make review much easier.

## Contributor credit

Accepted experiment pages may include a small contributor credit block at the bottom of the page.

This credit is meant to acknowledge meaningful contribution to that specific experiment page.

It is not ownership of the whole project, and it does not override the editorial direction of Tension Universe.

For consistency, contributor credit follows a fixed format and only accepts GitHub links.

See the format guide here:

## Open experiments

If you want to start from a currently open task, use the public experiment board below.

That page lists experiments that are already completed, in progress, or still open for contribution.

## A note for early contributors

Early contributors often become the first visible names attached to experiments that later grow into larger reference points.

This page does not promise traffic, status, or outcomes.

But if you believe this direction is worth building, contributing early is one of the clearest ways to leave a visible mark on the structure as it grows.

## Scope and editorial review

All contributed content may be edited for clarity, structure, naming consistency, formatting, or alignment with the broader direction of the project.

This keeps the overall field readable and coherent as more experiment pages are added over time.

If your contribution is accepted, your credit can remain attached to the page under the standard contributor format.

## Start here

If you are ready to contribute, the simplest next step is:

1. open the experiment board
2. pick one open item
3. draft one MVP page
4. submit it through an issue or PR

This project is being built in public.

If you want to help expand the field, you are welcome to build with it.
