## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This page provides an **effective layer encoding** of the canonical quantum gravity unification problem.
* It does **not** claim to construct any fundamental theory of quantum gravity.
* It does **not** claim to prove or disprove the canonical problem described in Section 1.
* It does **not** introduce new physical theorems beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It must **not** be cited as evidence that quantum gravity unification has been solved, disproved, or experimentally confirmed.

All objects used in this file, including state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds, live entirely inside the effective layer.

No mapping from raw empirical or simulation data to TU internal fields is specified here.
No deep generative rules or axiom systems for TU itself are exposed or assumed to be unique in this file.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical quantum gravity unification problem can be stated as follows.

There are two extremely successful frameworks.

1. **Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory**

   These describe matter and non gravitational interactions in terms of quantum states, operators, and amplitudes, usually on a fixed spacetime background.

2. **General relativity**

   This describes gravitation as the dynamics of spacetime geometry itself, where the metric responds to energy and momentum.

The unification problem asks:

> Does there exist a single consistent dynamical theory that
>
> 1. reduces to classical general relativity in the appropriate macroscopic, low curvature limit,
> 2. reduces to quantum field theory in regimes where gravity can be neglected or treated as a small correction, and
> 3. remains mathematically consistent and predictive in regimes where quantum effects of spacetime geometry are non negligible?

Equivalently, the question is whether there exists a theory that

* treats spacetime and matter in a fully quantum consistent way,
* recovers both quantum field theory and general relativity as limiting descriptions,
* and avoids internal contradictions such as non renormalizable divergences, loss of unitarity, or uncontrolled singularities.

This document does not assume that such a theory exists.
It also does not assume that such a theory fails to exist.
It only encodes how the unification question appears at the effective layer in terms of consistency_tension.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity is widely regarded as one of the central unsolved problems in theoretical physics.

Key points.

* Perturbative quantization of the metric field on a fixed background produces a non renormalizable theory. Higher loop corrections generate infinitely many counterterms with new free parameters.
* Semiclassical approaches, where gravity is classical but matter is quantum, face conceptual and technical problems. For example they struggle with backreaction and the role of measurement.
* Several major candidate frameworks exist, such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, asymptotic safety scenarios, and emergent gravity ideas. None has reached the status of a universally accepted solution with clear experimental confirmation.
* Observational access to Planck scale physics and strong quantum gravity effects is extremely limited. Most evidence is indirect or model dependent.

The problem is therefore both mathematically difficult and experimentally constrained. It sits at the intersection of quantum theory, gravitation, cosmology, and high energy physics.

Nothing in this entry changes that status. The goal is to describe a way to talk about the problem in terms of effective layer tension, not to resolve it.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q021 is the primary node for:

1. **Consistency_tension between formalisms**

   Q021 is the reference example of a problem where two mature formalisms, quantum field theory and classical general relativity, must be embedded in a single consistent dynamical_field description. The consistency_tension arises from trying to keep both regimes valid inside one effective picture.

2. **Cross regime unification**

   Q021 defines how to talk about low energy and high energy regimes, together with the bridges between them, using tension functionals instead of specific microphysical constructions. It focuses on cross regime consistency patterns rather than any single candidate theory.

3. **Template for other physics problems**

   Q021 provides core components that will be reused for black hole information (Q040), cosmological tensions (Q048), and related problems where gravity, quantum effects, and large scale observations must all fit together.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q021 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge includes a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type. Edges are part of the effective layer structure and do not encode any claim of solution.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

Upstream problems provide foundations and tools that Q021 relies on at the effective layer.

* **Q026 (BH_PHYS_QM_MEAS_L3_026)**
  Reason: supplies the foundations of quantum measurement and state update that any unified quantum gravity theory must respect when describing observers and records.

* **Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)**
  Reason: provides the quantum thermodynamic framework that constrains how energy, entropy, and information behave in curved spacetime settings.

* **Q028 (BH_PHYS_QCD_CONFINEMENT_L3_028)**
  Reason: offers a template for nonperturbative gauge dynamics that informs nonperturbative aspects of quantum gravity models at the effective layer.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

Downstream problems reuse Q021 components or assume Q021 style unification structure.

* **Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)**
  Reason: reuses QG_ConsistencyTensor and horizon tension observables to frame the black hole information problem in unified terms.

* **Q048 (BH_COSMO_H0_TENSION_L3_048)**
  Reason: uses QG_RegimeDecomposition and cross regime consistency indicators to test whether Hubble constant tension could reflect missing quantum gravity effects in an effective description.

* **Q041 (BH_COSMO_DARKMATTER_L3_041)**
  Reason: can reuse Q021 style mapping between quantum and geometric degrees of freedom for emergent gravity or modified gravity interpretations of dark matter phenomena at the level of observables.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension type or field type without direct component reuse.

* **Q022 (BH_PHYS_HIERARCHY_L3_022)**
  Reason: both Q021 and Q022 are consistency_tension problems between different scales. Q022 focuses on mass scales while Q021 focuses on geometry and quantum structure.

* **Q025 (BH_PHYS_BARYON_ASYM_L3_025)**
  Reason: both require cross era descriptions that connect microphysics to cosmological observations under strict consistency constraints.

* **Q033 (BH_PHYS_STRINGS_VS_ALTERN_L3_033)**
  Reason: both discuss candidate quantum gravity frameworks, but Q033 focuses on discrimination among frameworks while Q021 defines the basic unification tension functional.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q021 to problems in other domains that reuse its components.

* **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)**
  Reason: reuses cross scale consistency_tension between information theoretic quantities and thermodynamic observables in curved or effective backgrounds.

* **Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)**
  Reason: can reuse cross scale tension indicators as templates for systemic crash indicators in complex networks.

* **Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)**
  Reason: uses QG_ConsistencyTensor as a template for interpreting internal AI representations as layered fields that must remain consistent across scales.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* effective fields and observables,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* finite admissible encoding classes and fairness rules.

We do **not** describe any hidden generative rules or constructions that map raw data into deep TU internal fields. We do **not** assume that any candidate quantum gravity theory in the literature is the final true theory.

### 3.0 Encoding identifiers and precommit

For auditability we introduce explicit identifiers for this encoding.

```txt
EncodingKey_Q021: TU_QG_Encoding_v1
LibraryKey_lowE: TU_QG_LowEProfiles_v1
LibraryKey_highE: TU_QG_HighEConsistency_v1
LibraryKey_bridge: TU_QG_BridgeRules_v1
WeightKey_Q021: TU_QG_Weights_v1
```

The following precommit rules apply.

* The admissible encodings for Q021 form a **finite or effectively enumerable class** specified by the keys above.
* All libraries, region families, aggregation rules, and weight choices inside this class must be fixed **before** evaluating Q021 tension on any particular world dataset.
* No parameter inside this class may be tuned in response to specific data instances with the goal of forcing a low tension outcome.
* If every encoding inside this class fails the falsification tests in Section 6, then **this encoding program** for Q021 is considered falsified at the effective layer. This does **not** falsify the canonical quantum gravity problem or any specific microphysical theory.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M_QG
```

with the following effective layer interpretation.

Each element `m` in `M_QG` represents a coherent **quantum gravity world configuration** for a bounded spacetime region together with its matter content. For each `m` we assume that:

* there is an effective description of spacetime geometry in a region `R_spacetime`,
* there is an effective description of quantum matter and interaction fields in the same region,
* there are regime tags that indicate which description is dominant in that region, for example

  * classical general relativity regime,
  * semiclassical gravity regime,
  * deep quantum gravity regime.

We do not specify how these objects are constructed from any fundamental microscopic theory.
We also do not specify how raw experimental or simulation data are turned into states in `M_QG`.
We only assume that such states exist for the regions and regimes of interest and that this assumption can be tested indirectly through the experiments in Section 6.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables and fields on `M_QG`.

1. **Geometric field summary**

   ```txt
   G_geom(m; R)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` in `M_QG` and a bounded spacetime region `R` inside `R_spacetime`.
   * Output: a finite dimensional summary of geometric properties in `R`, such as approximate curvature invariants, causal structure indicators, and horizon flags.
   * Interpretation: describes how curved the region is and whether classical general relativity should be a good approximation there.

2. **Quantum matter summary**

   ```txt
   Q_matter(m; R)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and region `R`.
   * Output: a summary of quantum matter fields in `R`, such as effective stress energy expectation values, fluctuation amplitudes, and quantum coherence indicators.
   * Interpretation: describes the effective quantum field content that can gravitate in `R`.

3. **Low energy consistency mismatch**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_lowE(m; R) >= 0
   ```

   * Domain: regions `R` where curvature is small and energies are well below a chosen quantum gravity scale.

   * Output: a nonnegative scalar measuring deviation between

     * predictions derived by combining quantum field theory on curved spacetime and classical general relativity, and
     * the effective summaries encoded in `G_geom(m; R)` and `Q_matter(m; R)`,

     within a chosen low energy effective field theory tolerance.

   * Properties:

     * `DeltaS_lowE(m; R) = 0` when the encoded summaries match the combined low energy effective expectations inside that tolerance.
     * `DeltaS_lowE(m; R)` depends only on the encoding rules in `LibraryKey_lowE` and the summaries inside `m`.

4. **High energy consistency mismatch**

   ```txt
   DeltaS_highE(m; R) >= 0
   ```

   * Domain: regions `R` where curvature and energies approach or exceed a chosen quantum gravity scale.

   * Input:

     * a state `m`,
     * a region `R` with strong gravity or high energy,
     * a finite library of candidate high energy consistency constraints, specified by `LibraryKey_highE`.

   * Output: a nonnegative scalar measuring deviation between

     * the behaviour encoded in `G_geom(m; R)` and `Q_matter(m; R)`, and
     * a set of minimal consistency requirements such as approximate unitarity, boundedness of relevant observables, and compatibility with known semiclassical limits where those limits should apply.

   * Properties:

     * `DeltaS_highE(m; R) = 0` when the encoded behaviour satisfies all selected consistency requirements inside a fixed tolerance.
     * The consistency requirements come from a **finite library of constraints and candidate dynamics**. This library may include simplified versions of known quantum gravity proposals, but the encoding does **not** assume that any of them is the final true theory.

5. **Bridge consistency mismatch**

   We define a cross regime mismatch that checks whether a single effective description can span low and high energy segments that should be connected.

   ```txt
   DeltaS_bridge(m) >= 0
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` whose region `R_spacetime` can be decomposed into segments that include both low curvature and strong gravity regimes.

   * Output: a nonnegative scalar that measures how well a single candidate dynamics can produce

     * low energy behaviour matching `DeltaS_lowE` tolerances,
     * high energy behaviour matching `DeltaS_highE` tolerances,
     * conservation laws and causal structure across the boundaries between regimes,

     under the bridge rules selected by `LibraryKey_bridge`.

   * Properties:

     * `DeltaS_bridge(m) = 0` when one unified effective description passes all bridge checks inside fixed tolerances.
     * `DeltaS_bridge(m)` does not assume that any specific microscopic theory generates the data. It only evaluates compatibility with a chosen effective bridge specification.

### 3.3 Combined quantum gravity mismatch and tension tensor

We aggregate mismatch observables over families of regions.

Let

```txt
R_lowE(m)   subset of R_spacetime
R_highE(m)  subset of R_spacetime
```

be region families for state `m` selected according to rules in `LibraryKey_lowE` and `LibraryKey_highE`. The rules must be specified in advance and must not depend on the tension values for that particular `m`.

We define aggregate low and high energy mismatch values.

```txt
DeltaS_lowE_agg(m)  = Agg_lowE( { DeltaS_lowE(m; R) : R in R_lowE(m) } )
DeltaS_highE_agg(m) = Agg_highE( { DeltaS_highE(m; R) : R in R_highE(m) } )
```

where `Agg_lowE` and `Agg_highE` are fixed aggregation functionals (for example suprema, quantiles, or weighted averages) specified by `EncodingKey_Q021`.

We then define the combined quantum gravity mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_QG_total(m) = w_lowE  * DeltaS_lowE_agg(m)
                   + w_highE * DeltaS_highE_agg(m)
                   + w_bridge * DeltaS_bridge(m)
```

with weights constrained by `WeightKey_Q021`.

```txt
w_lowE  >= 0
w_highE >= 0
w_bridge >= 0
w_lowE + w_highE + w_bridge = 1
```

The set of admissible weight triplets is finite or effectively enumerable and fixed before any application to world data. We denote this set by `Weights_Q021_admissible`.

The effective tension tensor is then defined as

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_QG_total(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_QG
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor measuring how strongly the ith semantic component of the configuration contributes to QG related claims.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor measuring how sensitive the jth downstream component is to QG inconsistencies.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor inherited from the TU core, taking values in a fixed range that encodes local reasoning state.
* `kappa_QG` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of quantum gravity consistency_tension for this encoding.

The detailed structure of the indices `i` and `j` is not needed at the effective layer. It is sufficient that for each `m` in the allowed domain, `T_ij(m)` is well defined and finite for all relevant indices.

### 3.4 Invariants and effective constraints

We define three invariants.

1. **Low energy invariant**

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m) = sup over R in R_lowE(m) of DeltaS_lowE(m; R)
   ```

   where `R_lowE(m)` is selected by fixed rules in `LibraryKey_lowE`.

   In worlds where effective field theory plus classical general relativity is a good approximation in low curvature regimes, we expect that for suitable world representing states `m_world` there exists a tolerance `epsilon_lowE` such that

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m_world) <= epsilon_lowE
   ```

   where `epsilon_lowE` is controlled by experimental and modelling uncertainties and is chosen before evaluation.

2. **High energy invariant**

   ```txt
   I_highE(m) = sup over R in R_highE(m) of DeltaS_highE(m; R)
   ```

   where `R_highE(m)` is selected by rules in `LibraryKey_highE`.

   In worlds where some candidate quantum gravity dynamics is internally consistent in the strong gravity regimes under study, we expect that for suitable world representing states `m_world` there exists a tolerance `epsilon_highE` such that

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_world) <= epsilon_highE
   ```

   with `epsilon_highE` reflecting the quality of observational access and model uncertainties.

3. **Bridge invariant**

   ```txt
   I_bridge(m) = DeltaS_bridge(m)
   ```

   which is already defined as a scalar mismatch. It measures cross regime consistency and is central for Q021.

These invariants are required to be finite on all states that we treat as world representing under this encoding.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may lack enough information, or may encode behaviour that is too singular, for the above observables to be defined or finite. We collect them in a singular set.

```txt
S_sing_QG = {
  m in M_QG :
  DeltaS_QG_total(m) is undefined or not finite
  or I_lowE(m) is undefined
  or I_highE(m) is undefined
  or I_bridge(m) is undefined
}
```

We impose the following domain restriction.

* All Q021 analysis in the TU framework is restricted to

  ```txt
  M_QG_reg = M_QG \ S_sing_QG
  ```

* When an experiment or protocol attempts to evaluate Q021 observables on a state in `S_sing_QG`, the result is treated as **out of domain**, not as evidence about the existence or non existence of a successful quantum gravity unification.

The presence of many physically relevant scenarios in `S_sing_QG` would itself count as evidence that this encoding is inadequate. In that case the encoding must be revised or rejected at the effective layer.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q021 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define a quantum gravity tension functional

```txt
Tension_QG(m) = G_QG(
  DeltaS_lowE_agg(m),
  DeltaS_highE_agg(m),
  DeltaS_bridge(m)
)
```

A simple admissible choice is

```txt
Tension_QG(m) = a_lowE  * DeltaS_lowE_agg(m)
              + a_highE * DeltaS_highE_agg(m)
              + a_bridge * DeltaS_bridge(m)
```

with fixed positive coefficients `a_lowE`, `a_highE`, `a_bridge`. The set of admissible triplets `(a_lowE, a_highE, a_bridge)` is specified by `WeightKey_Q021` and is fixed before any application to world data.

Any chosen `G_QG` must satisfy:

* `Tension_QG(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_QG_reg`.
* `Tension_QG(m)` is small when all three mismatch components are small.
* `Tension_QG(m)` grows when any component grows, holding the others fixed.

### 4.2 Unified world as low tension principle

At the effective layer, quantum gravity unification can be phrased as a low tension principle.

> In worlds where a single quantum gravity dynamics successfully unifies quantum theory and general relativity, there exist world representing states `m` in `M_QG_reg` such that `Tension_QG(m)` remains in a narrow low tension band across all regimes where the unified theory claims validity.

More concretely, for any admissible encoding of low energy, high energy, and bridge regions inside `EncodingKey_Q021`, there should exist states `m_T` representing our world such that

```txt
Tension_QG(m_T) <= epsilon_QG
```

where `epsilon_QG` is a small threshold determined by the quality of the encoding and data. This threshold must be chosen before evaluation and should not grow without control as the encoding is refined or as more accurate measurements are incorporated.

This formulation does not assume that our world is of this type. It only specifies what a successful unified world would look like in terms of tension profiles.

### 4.3 Patchwork world as persistent high tension

If there is no truly unified quantum gravity dynamics that can cover all relevant regimes, then for any encoding that remains faithful to the observed successes of quantum field theory and general relativity in their respective domains, world representing states will eventually exhibit persistent high tension.

Formally, in such patchwork worlds, for every admissible encoding in `EncodingKey_Q021` there exists a strictly positive `delta_QG` such that

```txt
Tension_QG(m_F) >= delta_QG
```

for some world representing states `m_F` in `M_QG_reg`, in the sense that `Tension_QG` cannot be driven arbitrarily close to zero when we refine the encoding and incorporate more data, without sacrificing agreement with known low energy or high energy behaviour.

In this view, Q021 becomes the question of whether our universe is compatible with low `Tension_QG` under an admissible encoding class, or whether any faithful encoding is forced into high `Tension_QG`.

This is a statement about tension patterns, not about the existence or uniqueness of any particular fundamental theory.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual families of worlds, both described strictly at the effective layer.

* **World T**: a family of worlds where a single quantum gravity dynamics exists and unifies the relevant regimes at the effective level of description.
* **World F**: a family of worlds where no such unified dynamics exists, and only patchwork descriptions are possible.

These world families are logical constructs used to organize tension patterns. Q021 does not claim that either family is realized.

### 5.1 World T (unified quantum gravity, low consistency tension)

In World T:

1. **Low energy regime**

   There exist states `m_T` in `M_QG_reg` that represent the world in low curvature regimes such that

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m_T) <= epsilon_lowE
   ```

   where `epsilon_lowE` is a small tolerance consistent with experimental uncertainties in tests of general relativity and quantum field theory.

2. **High energy regime**

   For the same underlying unified dynamics, there exist corresponding states `m_T` that represent strong gravity regimes such as black holes and the early universe, with

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_T) <= epsilon_highE
   ```

   where `epsilon_highE` reflects current limits of observational access and model uncertainties.

3. **Bridge behaviour**

   There exist states `m_T` that encode both low energy and high energy segments, and for these states

   ```txt
   I_bridge(m_T) = DeltaS_bridge(m_T) <= epsilon_bridge
   ```

   for a small `epsilon_bridge`. This indicates that one unified dynamics can explain both segments without introducing irreparable contradictions at the effective layer.

4. **Global tension**

   For such states `m_T`, the combined tension satisfies

   ```txt
   Tension_QG(m_T) <= epsilon_QG
   ```

   for a set of tolerances `epsilon_lowE`, `epsilon_highE`, `epsilon_bridge`, `epsilon_QG` that are jointly small and stable under reasonable refinement of the encoding.

### 5.2 World F (no unified quantum gravity, high consistency tension)

In World F:

1. **Conflicting patchwork regimes**

   For any encoding that faithfully represents successful low energy predictions of current theories, we can find low energy states `m_F_low` that satisfy

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m_F_low) <= epsilon_lowE
   ```

   but for which any attempt to extend the same dynamics into strong gravity regimes leads to

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_F_low) >= delta_highE
   ```

   for some strictly positive `delta_highE`.

2. **High energy models without proper low energy limit**

   Alternatively, one may have states `m_F_high` that encode candidate strong gravity models with

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_F_high) <= epsilon_highE
   ```

   but any attempt to connect these states to realistic low energy behaviour drives

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m_F_high) >= delta_lowE
   ```

   with `delta_lowE > 0`.

3. **Bridge failure**

   For any encoding that tries to connect low energy and high energy data using a single description, the bridge invariant obeys

   ```txt
   I_bridge(m_F) >= delta_bridge
   ```

   where `delta_bridge > 0` is a lower bound that does not vanish as resolution improves or as more data are incorporated, as long as the encoding stays faithful to the evidence.

4. **Global tension**

   In such worlds, for any admissible encoding class inside `EncodingKey_Q021`, there is a lower bound `delta_QG > 0` with

   ```txt
   Tension_QG(m_F) >= delta_QG
   ```

   for at least some world representing states `m_F` in `M_QG_reg`.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual world families do not commit to any particular microphysical model or candidate quantum gravity theory. They only describe patterns of effective observables and tension functionals.

The purpose is to:

* clarify what patterns would count as evidence for a successful unification at the effective layer, and
* clarify what patterns would signal that only patchwork descriptions are possible, given the chosen encoding.

Q021 does not assert that our universe belongs to World T or to World F. It only sets up the effective layer language needed to ask that question in a structured way.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q021 encoding,
* distinguish between different quantum gravity tension encodings inside `EncodingKey_Q021`,
* provide evidence for or against specific parameter choices.

These experiments do **not** solve Q021.
They can only falsify or support particular TU encodings related to Q021.

### Experiment 1: Low curvature consistency stress test

**Goal.**
Test whether the chosen definitions of `DeltaS_lowE` and `I_lowE` align with precision tests of general relativity and quantum field theory in weak gravity regimes.

**Setup.**

* Input data: a collection of well tested low curvature situations, such as

  * solar system dynamics,
  * binary pulsars,
  * gravitational lensing,
  * weak field gravitational wave observations,

  together with the corresponding energy and matter distributions, and associated uncertainties.

* For each situation, construct an effective state `m_data` in `M_QG_reg` that encodes geometric summaries `G_geom(m_data; R)` and quantum matter summaries `Q_matter(m_data; R)` for relevant regions `R`.

* Fix once and for all:

  * a family `R_lowE` of regions and selection rules, defined in `LibraryKey_lowE`,
  * a definition of `DeltaS_lowE(m; R)` consistent with standard effective field theory expectations,
  * an aggregation rule for `I_lowE`.

**Protocol.**

1. For each low curvature scenario, evaluate `DeltaS_lowE(m_data; R)` on all regions `R` in `R_lowE`.

2. Compute

   ```txt
   I_lowE(m_data) = sup over R in R_lowE of DeltaS_lowE(m_data; R)
   ```

3. Compare the resulting values with a tolerance band derived from experimental uncertainties and accepted theoretical error estimates.

4. Repeat the evaluation under modest variations of encoding parameters permitted by `EncodingKey_Q021`, such as small changes in aggregation rules that remain inside the admissible class.

**Metrics.**

* Distribution of `I_lowE(m_data)` across all scenarios.
* Maximum observed `I_lowE` value.
* Sensitivity of `I_lowE` to allowed parameter variations.

**Falsification conditions.**

* If, for all reasonable choices of encoding parameters inside `EncodingKey_Q021` and for all weight triplets in `Weights_Q021_admissible`, the observed `I_lowE(m_data)` values consistently exceed a pre defined upper bound compatible with known tests of general relativity and quantum field theory, then this encoding of `DeltaS_lowE` and `I_lowE` is considered **falsified**.
* If small allowed variations in the encoding lead to arbitrarily large swings in `I_lowE` that have no clear physical justification, the encoding is considered **unstable** and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note.**
The experiment is implemented in a continuous field sense consistent with the metadata semantics. No discrete or hybrid reinterpretation is introduced here.

**Boundary note.**
Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment does **not** solve the canonical quantum gravity problem. It only rejects a particular way of encoding low curvature consistency tension.

**Audit note.**
External reviewers should be able to reconstruct `EncodingKey_Q021`, the full admissible set of low energy encodings, and the tolerance bands used. If this reconstruction is impossible, the experiment does not meet the TU audit standard.

### Experiment 2: Cross regime bridge consistency test

**Goal.**
Assess whether a given encoding of `DeltaS_highE`, `DeltaS_bridge`, and `I_bridge` can provide coherent cross regime predictions when confronted with a chain of observations from early universe cosmology to late time structure and black hole observations.

**Setup.**

* Input data.

  * Cosmological observations that constrain early universe physics, such as cosmic microwave background spectra and large scale structure statistics.
  * Observations of black holes and strong gravity, such as gravitational wave ringdown data and accretion disc spectra.

* For each combined dataset, construct states `m_chain` in `M_QG_reg` that encode:

  * early universe segments,
  * intermediate expansion history,
  * late time structures and strong gravity objects.

* Fix families `R_highE` and bridge rules consistent with `LibraryKey_highE` and `LibraryKey_bridge`.

**Protocol.**

1. For each combined dataset, evaluate `DeltaS_highE(m_chain; R)` over all regions in `R_highE`.

2. Compute `DeltaS_highE_agg(m_chain)` and `DeltaS_bridge(m_chain)`.

3. Evaluate the invariants

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_chain) = sup over R in R_highE of DeltaS_highE(m_chain; R)
   I_bridge(m_chain) = DeltaS_bridge(m_chain)
   ```

4. Check whether there exists at least one admissible choice of parameters inside `EncodingKey_Q021` such that

   ```txt
   I_highE(m_chain) <= epsilon_highE
   I_bridge(m_chain) <= epsilon_bridge
   ```

   for tolerances consistent with observational and theoretical uncertainties.

5. Repeat for several independent chains of observations.

**Metrics.**

* Values of `I_highE(m_chain)` and `I_bridge(m_chain)` across different chains.
* Existence or absence of parameter choices that keep both invariants below their thresholds.
* Stability of the results under refinement of data resolution or inclusion of additional observational constraints.

**Falsification conditions.**

* If no admissible parameter choices within the encoding class can keep both `I_highE(m_chain)` and `I_bridge(m_chain)` below their thresholds across a representative set of observation chains, then the encoding is considered **falsified** at the effective layer.
* If small changes in the admissible parameters can flip the result from low tension to high tension in ways that do not correspond to meaningful physical changes, the encoding is considered **ill conditioned** and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note.**
All quantities are treated in the continuous field sense consistent with the metadata semantics, including the coarse grained description of cosmological and strong gravity observables.

**Boundary note.**
Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment does **not** settle the existence or non existence of a unified quantum gravity theory. It only rules out a particular way of encoding quantum gravity consistency_tension.

**Audit note.**
The full specification of the observation chains, the selection rules for `R_highE`, and the definitions of `DeltaS_highE` and `DeltaS_bridge` must be available for independent inspection. Without this level of detail, claims based on this experiment are not considered TU compliant.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q021 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer.

The components below are **meta consistency tools**. They must **not** be used to claim that the AI system has solved quantum gravity. They only help the system track which parts of its own reasoning would require a solution to Q021.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be attached to AI models dealing with physics and cosmology.

1. `signal_QG_consistency_lowE`

   * Definition: a nonnegative signal proportional to `DeltaS_lowE_agg(m)` when the model reasons about low curvature situations.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states that imply low energy behaviour inconsistent with tests of general relativity and quantum field theory when such tests are explicitly part of the context.

2. `signal_QG_consistency_highE`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_highE_agg(m)` in strong gravity or high energy contexts.
   * Purpose: encourage internal representations that avoid unphysical behaviour such as uncontrolled divergences or violations of basic consistency requirements in regimes where the encoding claims to apply.

3. `signal_QG_bridge_integrity`

   * Definition: a signal based on `DeltaS_bridge(m)` when the model attempts to connect early universe physics, late time cosmology, and strong gravity phenomena in one reasoning chain.
   * Purpose: disfavor reasoning paths that implicitly rely on incompatible descriptions for different segments of the same scenario.

4. `signal_QG_counterfactual_separation`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how clearly the model distinguishes World T style assumptions from World F style assumptions when prompted to explore both.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to keep unified and patchwork scenarios separate, rather than mixing them into a single incoherent narrative.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q021 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `QG_ConsistencyHead`

   * Role: a module that takes internal representations of a physics scenario and outputs an estimate of `Tension_QG(m)` and its components.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: latent vectors that encode geometric, matter, and regime information.
     * Outputs: `tension_total`, `tension_lowE`, `tension_highE`, `tension_bridge`.

2. `RegimeClassifier_QG`

   * Role: a module that assigns regime tags (low energy, high energy, bridge) to parts of a scenario.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal representations of spacetime regions or problem segments.
     * Outputs: discrete or soft regime labels used to select the appropriate part of the tension functional.

3. `TU_SpacetimeField_Observer`

   * Role: a general observer that extracts simplified geometric and matter summaries suitable for tension evaluation.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: model internal states for physics problems.
     * Outputs: approximate `G_geom` and `Q_matter` summaries.

These modules operate entirely at the effective layer. They do not expose or depend on any specific deep level TU generative rules.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness to test AI systems equipped with Q021 modules.

1. **Task selection**

   Construct a benchmark of physics questions and scenarios that span

   * low curvature regimes where standard general relativity and quantum field theory are well tested,
   * strong gravity situations such as black holes,
   * cross regime questions linking early universe conditions to late time observations.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline condition: the model operates without `QG_ConsistencyHead` or `RegimeClassifier_QG`.
   * TU condition: the model uses Q021 modules, and the training signals from Section 7.1 are active.

3. **Metrics**

   * Accuracy on questions where known low energy and strong gravity predictions apply.
   * Internal consistency, measured by how often the model contradicts its own earlier assumptions about regimes when asked follow up questions.
   * Quality of cross regime reasoning, measured by rubrics that score whether the model keeps track of which descriptions should apply where and whether it flags parts of the answer that would require solving Q021.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This protocol lets external users experience the impact of Q021 encoding in an AI system in a short interaction.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain why unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity is hard, and to give examples where each theory works well.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation treats regimes loosely, mixes approximations, or glosses over where each theory is valid.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt: ask the same question, but explicitly instruct the AI to use

    * low energy and high energy regimes,
    * bridges between regimes,
    * and a notion of quantum gravity consistency tension

    as organizing concepts.

  * Observation: record whether the explanation now clearly distinguishes low curvature, strong gravity, and cross regime aspects, and whether it uses something like `Tension_QG` to talk about success or failure of unification.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Use a rubric with scores for regime clarity, explicit linkage between regimes, and avoidance of contradictions.
  * Optionally, have independent human evaluators compare the two answers without being told which one used the TU encoding.

* **What to log**

  * All prompts, answers, and any auxiliary tension scores produced by Q021 modules.
  * These logs enable later inspection without exposing any TU deep level rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q021 and how they transfer to other problems. All components are tagged with `EncodingKey_Q021: TU_QG_Encoding_v1`.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. **ComponentName: `QG_ConsistencyTensor`**

   * Type: functional.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `geom_summary`, `matter_summary`, `regime_labels`.
     * Output: `tension_value` (a nonnegative scalar), together with optional decomposed components such as `tension_lowE`, `tension_highE`, and `tension_bridge`.

   * Preconditions:

     * Summaries must represent a coherent physical scenario over one or several regimes.
     * Regime labels must be compatible with the definitions used for low energy, high energy, and bridge segments.

2. **ComponentName: `QG_RegimeDecomposition`**

   * Type: experiment_pattern.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: description of a scenario that spans multiple scales, for example from early universe to present day, or from far field to near horizon.
     * Output: a decomposition of the scenario into low energy segments, high energy segments, and bridge segments, together with associated region families `R_lowE`, `R_highE`.

   * Preconditions:

     * The scenario must admit such a decomposition under standard physical assumptions.

3. **ComponentName: `QG_BridgeInvariant_Spec`**

   * Type: functional or observable spec.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: outputs of `QG_RegimeDecomposition` and effective summaries of geometry and matter.
     * Output: a scalar bridge invariant `I_bridge` defined in terms of `DeltaS_bridge` and related quantities.

   * Preconditions:

     * The encoding must supply rules for aggregating low energy and high energy mismatches into a single bridge mismatch.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. **Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)**

   * Reused components: `QG_ConsistencyTensor`, `QG_RegimeDecomposition`.
   * Why it transfers: the black hole information problem requires tracking consistency between quantum field descriptions of matter, horizon geometry, and late time radiation. These are cross regime situations where the same tensor and regime decomposition apply.
   * What changes: regimes and regions are chosen to track infall, near horizon dynamics, and asymptotic observers. The tension functional is tuned to information flow quantities, but its structural form remains as in Q021.

2. **Q048 (BH_COSMO_H0_TENSION_L3_048)**

   * Reused component: `QG_RegimeDecomposition`.
   * Why it transfers: Hubble constant tension involves early universe physics, recombination era observables, and late time distance ladder measurements. These can be segmented into regimes and connected with bridge invariants.
   * What changes: the inputs become cosmological observables instead of local spacetime regions, and the invariants are defined in terms of expansion history and distance measures rather than local curvature.

3. **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)**

   * Reused component: `QG_ConsistencyTensor` as a template.
   * Why it transfers: cross scale consistency between information processing and thermodynamics in curved or effective backgrounds can be phrased using a similar tensor that couples fields to tension measures.
   * What changes: the semantic interpretation of inputs becomes information theoretic, but the structure of a nonnegative tension scalar built from mismatches remains the same.

4. **Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)**

   * Reused components: `QG_ConsistencyTensor`, `QG_BridgeInvariant_Spec`.
   * Why it transfers: the idea of a multi scale consistency tensor can be mapped to internal AI representations that must remain coherent between layers and modules.
   * What changes: geometric and matter summaries are replaced by summaries of internal activations, but the bridge invariant still measures how well different layers fit a single consistent description.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q021 is positioned on the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **Encoding version**

  ```txt
  QG_Encoding_Version: 1.0-effective-layer-beta
  EncodingKey_Q021: TU_QG_Encoding_v1
  ```

* **E_level: E1**

  * A coherent effective layer encoding has been specified, including state space, observables, invariants, tension functional, and a finite admissible encoding class.
  * At least two discriminating experiments with explicit falsification conditions have been defined.

* **N_level: N1**

  * The narrative clearly states the unification problem in terms of consistency_tension between regimes.
  * World T and World F counterfactuals are described at a qualitative but precise level.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To upgrade Q021 from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented in practice.

1. A concrete library of admissible encodings for `DeltaS_lowE`, `DeltaS_highE`, and `DeltaS_bridge`, with explicit constraints on weights and aggregation rules, published in a form that others can inspect and reconstruct from the keys in Section 3.0.

2. A prototype that takes real or simulated data for

   * low curvature tests,
   * strong gravity observations,
   * cosmological chains,

   and computes `Tension_QG(m_data)` across scenarios, with code and resulting tension profiles made available for independent verification.

Both steps remain at the effective layer and do not require revealing any deep TU generative rules. They focus on making choices explicit and testable.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q021 is expected to serve as:

* the reference node for all dynamical_field consistency_tension problems that link microphysics, geometry, and cosmology,
* a calibration ground for how far TU style encodings can go on extremely hard physics problems without overclaiming success,
* a bridge between fundamental physics, cosmology, complex systems, and AI interpretability, by supplying reusable patterns for cross scale consistency analysis.

Any future revision of this page must preserve a visible version history and keep prior encodings available for comparison, so that external auditors can track how the Q021 encoding evolves.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non experts, while still aligned with the effective layer description.

Quantum mechanics and general relativity are both very successful. Quantum theory handles atoms, particles, and forces. General relativity describes spacetime and gravity as curved geometry.

The trouble is that they are built in very different ways. In many situations you can use one or the other and you get correct predictions. When you try to put them together in a single picture, especially near black holes or at the beginning of the universe, you run into contradictions or infinities.

The usual question is “Can we find one theory that includes both?”.
In the Tension Universe view, we ask a slightly different question.

> When we look at all the places where these theories should overlap, how much internal tension do we see between the descriptions?

We imagine a large space of states. Each state encodes:

* a region of spacetime and how curved it is,
* what matter and radiation are doing there,
* whether this region is low energy, extreme gravity, or a bridge between the two.

For each such state we measure:

* how much low energy predictions disagree with what is encoded,
* how much high energy consistency requirements disagree with what is encoded,
* how hard it is to use one description to cover both sides at once.

We combine these mismatches into one number called `Tension_QG`.

Then we imagine two kinds of possible worlds.

* In a world where quantum gravity is truly unified, there should be ways to encode our universe so that `Tension_QG` stays small, even when we look at low energy laboratories, violent astrophysical events, and the early universe in one picture.
* In a world where there is no such unifying theory and only patchwork descriptions, any honest way of encoding what we know will eventually give a `Tension_QG` that stays noticeably large somewhere, no matter how we tune the details inside a fixed admissible class.

This does not tell us which kind of world we live in.
It does not give a specific theory of quantum gravity.

What it provides is:

* a clear way to define what “unification” should look like in terms of tension patterns,
* a list of observables and experiments that test whether a given encoding makes sense,
* a set of components that can be reused in other problems, from black holes to cosmology to complex systems.

This file is **not** evidence that quantum gravity has been solved. It is a specification of how Q021 is represented inside the Tension Universe framework at the effective layer, under explicit and auditable rules.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual "worlds") live inside the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No assumptions are made about any particular choice of axioms or deep generative rules for TU itself.
* No mapping from raw empirical data to TU internal fields is specified in this file.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding choices in this file (libraries, weights, invariants, admissible parameter sets) are made at the spec level and must be fixed before any evaluation on world data.
* Admissible encodings form a finite or effectively enumerable class that can be audited externally.
* If all encodings in this class fail the falsification tests in Section 6, the encoding program for this problem is considered falsified at the effective layer, not the underlying canonical theory.

### Reuse and versioning

* Components defined here (modules, invariants, experiment patterns) may be reused by other TU problems, but only at the effective layer and only with explicit version tags.
* Any future revision of this page must preserve a visible version history and keep prior encodings available for comparison.
