## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

More precisely:

* We only define:

  * state spaces,
  * observables and fields,
  * tension functionals,
  * singular sets and regular domains,
  * falsifiable experiment patterns,
  * engineering style modules for AI systems.

* We **do not**:

  * prove or disprove the canonical existence of one way functions,
  * introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cryptography and complexity theory literature,
  * claim that any specific candidate construction is secure or insecure in the real world.

* All encodings and experiment patterns in this page are governed by:

  * the **TU Effective Layer Charter**,
  * the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter**,
  * the **TU Tension Scale Charter**,

  and are meant to be auditable against these charters.

* Any violation of these charters, or of the admissible encoding rules specified in Section 3.4, results in the corresponding encoding being **retired** for Q053. Retiring an encoding means that:

  * its tension values must not be used as evidence about the canonical problem,
  * it may remain as historical record but not as part of the active TU evidence set.

Nothing in this page should be cited as evidence that the canonical existence question for one way functions has been solved.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Informally, a one way function is a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert.

At a standard complexity theoretic level, a family of functions

```txt
f_n: {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^n, for n = 1,2,3,...
```

is called a candidate one way function family if:

1. There is a deterministic algorithm that, on input a bitstring `x` of length `n`, computes `f_n(x)` in time bounded by some polynomial in `n`.
2. For every probabilistic polynomial time algorithm `A` and every polynomial `p`, there exists an `n_0` such that for all `n >= n_0`, when `x` is drawn uniformly from `{0,1}^n`, the probability that `A(f_n(x))` outputs a preimage `x_prime` with `f_n(x_prime) = f_n(x)` is at most `1 / p(n)`.

The canonical open problem is:

> Do one way function families exist in this sense?

The answer is currently unknown. The existence of such functions would imply a rich cryptographic world and would have strong consequences for complexity theory.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The existence of one way functions is widely believed but unproven. Partial relationships include:

* If one way functions exist, then P is not equal to NP. The converse is not known.
* Many standard cryptographic primitives (pseudorandom generators, symmetric encryption schemes, digital signatures) can be constructed assuming one way functions exist.
* Many concrete number theoretic or lattice based constructions are conjectured to be one way under widely studied hardness assumptions, but none are currently proven to be one way in the unconditional complexity theoretic sense described above.

Impagliazzo’s “five worlds” picture frames this as the distinction between worlds in which average case hardness exists in a usable form for cryptography and worlds in which it does not. The existence of one way functions would mean we do not live in Pessiland and that at least a “Minicrypt” type world holds.

Despite decades of work in complexity theory, circuit lower bounds, and average case complexity, no unconditional example of a one way function family is known. Proving or refuting their existence is an outstanding problem in theoretical computer science.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q053 serves as:

1. The root node for computational_tension problems involving asymmetry between forward and inverse tasks.
2. The anchor for a cluster of cryptographic and complexity problems that depend on the existence or nonexistence of average case hardness.
3. A template for encoding “hardness worlds” in the Tension Universe framework, where forward tasks are resource efficient but inverse tasks remain hard under admissible attack models.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q053 sits among Q001–Q125. Each edge comes with a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension structure.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or tools that Q053 depends on at the effective layer.

* Q051 (BH_CS_P_VS_NP_L3_051)
  Reason: Supplies the global complexity landscape that constrains which hardness patterns are even possible for one way functions.

* Q052 (BH_CS_P_VS_BQP_L3_052)

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share a similar tension type but do not directly depend on Q053 components.

* Q055 (BH_CS_GRAPH_ISO_L3_055)

  Reason: Shares the same deep gap between what is believed to be hard and what can actually be proved with current methods.

* Q057 (BH_AI_RL_GENERALIZATION_L3_057)
  Reason: Parallel in the form of “information richness vs hardness” tension, although focused on learning rather than inversion.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges show where components of Q053 can be reused.

* Q105 (BH_SOC_SYSTEMIC_CRASH_PREDICT_L3_105)
  Reason: Uses one way like asymmetry between easy build up of risk and hard early inversion of that build up into actionable warning signals.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_CORE_L3_121)
  Reason: Reuses hardness world constructions to frame tasks whose inverse problems are effectively one way at realistic oversight budgets.

* Q125 (BH_AI_MULTIAGENT_DYNAMICS_L3_125)
  Reason: Uses inversion gap patterns to model situations where revealing hidden information is harder than exploiting it.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays strictly at the effective layer. We describe:

* state space,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* admissible encoding constraints.

We do not describe any deep generative rule or any explicit mapping from raw code or hardware to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a discrete state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation:

* Each element `m` in `M` is a coherent “hardness world configuration” for candidate one way functions.
* A state `m` contains abstract summaries of three ingredients:

  * A family of candidate functions, written informally as `F = { f_n }` where each `f_n` maps `n` bit strings to `n` bit strings and is intended to be efficiently computable.
  * A library of attack procedures, written informally as `A_lib`, containing descriptions of algorithms that attempt to invert `F` under resource limits.
  * A set of resource scales, written as a sequence of discrete levels `k = 1,2,3,...`, each associated with a pair of parameters `(time_bound_k, success_threshold_k)`.

We do not describe how `F`, `A_lib`, or the parameters are constructed from source code or real hardware. We only require that, for each state `m` in `M`, the following effective observables are well defined.

### 3.2 Effective observables

We introduce the following observables on `M`.

1. Forward cost observable

```txt
Forward_cost(m; F, k) >= 0
```

* Input: a state `m`, a candidate family `F` inside `m`, and a resource scale index `k`.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar that summarizes the cost of computing `f_n(x)` for typical inputs of length `n` under the time bound associated with scale `k`.
* Interpretation: for family `F` to be “easy to compute” at scale `k`, this observable should remain bounded by a fixed reference value that corresponds to polynomial time behavior.

2. Inversion success observable

```txt
Inv_success(m; F, A_lib, k) in [0,1]
```

* Input: a state `m`, a candidate family `F`, an attack library `A_lib`, and a resource scale index `k`.
* Output: the maximum success probability, over all attacks in `A_lib` that respect the resource bounds at scale `k`, of outputting a valid preimage for a random image of `F`.
* Interpretation: higher values indicate more successful inversion under a given attack library and resource limit.

3. Inversion cost observable

```txt
Inv_cost(m; F, A_lib, k) >= 0
```

* Input: a state `m`, a candidate family `F`, an attack library `A_lib`, and a resource scale index `k`.
* Output: an effective scalar summarizing the resource cost required by the best performing attack in `A_lib` that achieves at least the success threshold associated with scale `k`.

4. Inversion gap observable

We define an inversion gap observable that captures the asymmetry between forward and inverse tasks:

```txt
Gap_inv(m; F, A_lib, k) =
    Inv_cost(m; F, A_lib, k) - Forward_cost(m; F, k)
```

with the understanding that:

* `Gap_inv(m; F, A_lib, k)` is truncated below at zero if the right hand side would be negative.
* Larger values of `Gap_inv` indicate stronger asymmetry between forward and inverse costs at scale `k`.

### 3.3 Singular set and domain restriction

Some states may not support coherent definitions of these observables. We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  Forward_cost or Inv_cost or Inv_success is undefined,
  not finite, or internally inconsistent across scales
}
```

Examples of states in `S_sing` include:

* States where the resource scales are not properly ordered or are self contradictory.
* States where the encoding of `F` or `A_lib` does not permit clear separation between forward computation and inversion attempts.
* States where nominal “polynomial” resource bounds cannot be mapped to any finite reference band in the effective description.

All Q053 analysis is restricted to the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

Any attempt to evaluate Q053 observables for states in `S_sing` is treated as “out of domain” and not as evidence for or against the canonical problem.

### 3.4 Admissible encoding class `Enc_Q053`

To prevent hidden parameter tuning and post hoc choices, we restrict attention to an admissible encoding class `Enc_Q053` defined by:

1. Candidate families

   * Each family `F` must be described by a fixed rule or specification that does not depend on any attack outcomes.
   * The description of `F` is part of the state `m` and is not allowed to change when new attacks are considered.

2. Attack libraries

   * For each state `m`, the attack library `A_lib` is a finite collection of algorithm descriptions selected from a larger, fixed universe of allowable algorithm templates.
   * The selection rule for `A_lib` may depend on public design choices, for example “include all known attacks published up to a certain date”, but may not depend on the specific behavior of `F` on hidden instances.

3. Resource scales

   * Resource scales are indexed by integers `k = 1,2,3,...`.
   * Each `k` corresponds to a time bound `time_bound_k(n)` and a success threshold `success_threshold_k`, both specified independently of particular families or attacks.
   * The sequence of scales is monotone in the sense that higher `k` corresponds to larger time bounds or higher allowed resource usage.

4. Observable dependence

   * All observables `Forward_cost`, `Inv_success`, `Inv_cost`, and `Gap_inv` depend only on the triple `(F, A_lib, scale_parameters)` as encoded in `m`.
   * No observable is allowed to depend on hidden post hoc adjustments of `F`, `A_lib`, or the scale parameters.

The encoding class `Enc_Q053` is intended to be compatible with the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter**. Encodings that violate either the charter or the rules above are considered **invalid** for Q053 and must be retired. Retired encodings:

* may be kept as log entries,
* must not be used when aggregating tension values or drawing narrative conclusions about Q053.

This admissible encoding class may later be refined at higher E levels. Even at E1 it excludes trivial encodings that could force any family to look one way or not one way by tuning after seeing outcomes.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q053 is characterized as a computational_tension problem within TU.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective one way tension functional at scale `k`:

```txt
Tension_OWF(m; F, A_lib, k) =
    alpha * Forward_ease(m; F, k)
  + beta  * Inversion_hardness(m; F, A_lib, k)
```

where:

* `alpha > 0` and `beta > 0` are fixed constants chosen once for this encoding.
* `Forward_ease(m; F, k)` is a nonnegative score that is large when `Forward_cost(m; F, k)` is small relative to the reference polynomial band.
* `Inversion_hardness(m; F, A_lib, k)` is a nonnegative score that is large when `Gap_inv(m; F, A_lib, k)` is large and `Inv_success(m; F, A_lib, k)` remains below its success threshold.

We require:

* `Tension_OWF(m; F, A_lib, k) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg` and all indices `k`.
* `Tension_OWF` is small when forward computation is expensive or when inversion is comparably easy.
* `Tension_OWF` is large when forward computation is cheap and inversion remains hard even at high scales.

For many purposes it is convenient to define an aggregated tension value over a finite set of scales `K`:

```txt
Tension_OWF_total(m; F, A_lib, K) =
    average over k in K of Tension_OWF(m; F, A_lib, k)
```

This aggregated value can be used when we need a single number to describe the overall asymmetry at several scales.

### 4.2 One way world as persistent asymmetry

At the effective layer, the existence of one way functions corresponds to the following tension principle:

> There exists at least one family `F` such that, for world representing states `m` in `M_reg` and for all sufficiently large scales `k`, the one way tension `Tension_OWF(m; F, A_lib, k)` stays in a high asymmetry band, robust under admissible changes in attack libraries and precise parameter choices.

More concretely, the one way world requires that there exist:

* a candidate family `F`,
* a sequence of world representing states `m_real` in `M_reg` that represent improved knowledge about this family and its attacks,
* a family of attack libraries `A_lib_real` within `Enc_Q053`,

such that there exists a positive constant `delta_OWF` and a finite index `k_0` with:

```txt
Tension_OWF(m_real; F, A_lib_real, k) >= delta_OWF
for all k >= k_0
```

and such that small admissible changes in the encoding or attack library do not collapse `Tension_OWF` below this band.

### 4.3 No one way world as collapsed asymmetry

Conversely, in a world where one way functions do not exist, any attempt to realize such a persistent asymmetry fails in one of two ways:

1. Forward failure

   * For every candidate family `F` and every world representing sequence of states `m_trial` in `M_reg`, either `Forward_cost(m_trial; F, k)` fails to remain within the “easy” band at large scales or the family collapses into trivial behavior.

2. Inversion collapse

   * Alternatively, whenever a candidate family `F` appears to exhibit high `Tension_OWF` at some finite range of scales, there exist admissible attack library extensions and scale increases that eventually cause `Gap_inv` to shrink and `Inv_success` to grow, leading to:

     ```txt
     lim inf over large k of Tension_OWF(m_trial; F, A_lib_extended, k) = 0
     ```

At the effective layer, Q053 encodes the gap between these two types of worlds as a distinction in long term behavior of the one way tension functional under admissible encodings.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds in terms of observable patterns, not deep generative rules. All world representing states mentioned in this section are taken in the regular domain `M_reg`.

### 5.1 World T (one way functions exist)

In World T:

1. Existence of a stable one way family

   * There exists a family `F_star` and world representing states `m_T` in `M_reg` such that forward computation of `F_star` stays inside a stable “easy” cost band for all large scales.
   * For these states and any admissible attack library `A_lib` in `Enc_Q053` that reflects current algorithmic knowledge, `Gap_inv(m_T; F_star, A_lib, k)` remains large for all sufficiently large `k`.

2. Robustness under attack progress

   * When `A_lib` is extended to include newly discovered attacks, `Tension_OWF(m_T; F_star, A_lib, k)` may fluctuate but does not collapse to near zero across all large scales.
   * Some attacks may reduce the asymmetry at specific scales, but the overall asymmetry band survives under admissible encoding changes.

3. Cryptographic world structure

   * The hardness world constructed from `F_star` supports further constructions of primitives that inherit high inversion gap, matching the “Minicrypt” or “Cryptomania” worlds in Impagliazzo’s picture.

### 5.2 World F (no one way functions exist)

In World F:

1. Universal inversion by admissible attacks

   * For every candidate family `F` and any world representing states `m_F` in `M_reg`, there exists a sequence of admissible attack library extensions and scale increases that eventually yields small `Gap_inv` and high `Inv_success`.
   * The corresponding `Tension_OWF(m_F; F, A_lib, k)` values get driven into a low asymmetry band at large scales.

2. Cryptography from structure, not complexity

   * Any nontrivial cryptographic primitive that seems to depend on one way functions ultimately relies on information theoretic structure or heavily constrained models, not on persistent average case hardness in the sense encoded here.

3. Hardness illusions

   * States that temporarily show large `Tension_OWF` are later recognized as incomplete encodings, either because new attacks are added to `A_lib` or because resource scales are recalibrated.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These two worlds do not claim to describe real computation at the machine code level. They are not claims about which world we actually live in.

They only specify how observable hardness patterns and tension scores would behave if the universe were organized according to each scenario. They provide a structured way to express what it would mean, at the effective layer, for one way functions to exist or not exist.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of the Q053 encoding,
* distinguish different hardness world models,
* provide evidence for or against specific parameter choices inside `Enc_Q053`.

They do not prove or refute the existence of one way functions. All experiments explicitly restrict attention to states in `M_reg`. Any state that falls in `S_sing` is logged as out of domain and excluded from tension statistics.

### Experiment 1: Synthetic hardness vs easy families

**Goal**
Test whether the one way tension functional can reliably separate artificial families that are constructed to be “easy to invert” from families constructed to mimic one way like behavior.

**Setup**

* Construct or select several synthetic function families:

  * Family E (easy): functions where both forward and inverse algorithms are known and have similar resource profiles.
  * Family H (hard like): functions where forward computation is efficient, but known inversion algorithms are intentionally restricted or made to be much more expensive at the effective layer.

* For each family, design admissible encodings `m_E` and `m_H` in `M_reg` with matched resource scales and attack library constraints in `Enc_Q053`.

* Fix encoding parameters, including `alpha`, `beta`, and how `Forward_ease` and `Inversion_hardness` are computed, before observing any outcomes.

**Protocol**

1. For each family and each scale index `k` in a chosen finite set `K`, evaluate:

   * `Forward_cost(m; F, k)`,
   * `Inv_cost(m; F, A_lib, k)`,
   * `Inv_success(m; F, A_lib, k)`,
   * `Gap_inv(m; F, A_lib, k)`,
   * `Tension_OWF(m; F, A_lib, k)`,

   for states `m` restricted to `M_reg`.

2. Compute aggregated tension values `Tension_OWF_total` for each family over `K`.

3. Compare the distributions of tension values between Family E and Family H.

4. Repeat under modest variations of `A_lib` in `Enc_Q053` (for example adding simple attacks that do not change the intended hardness pattern) to check robustness.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `Tension_OWF_total` for Family E and Family H.
* Separation between the distributions, measured by a simple distance or overlap metric.
* Stability of the separation under admissible variations of encoding and attack libraries.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, under fixed admissible encodings in `Enc_Q053`, the encoding fails to produce consistently lower tension values for Family E than for Family H, the Q053 tension functional is considered falsified for this setup.
* If small admissible modifications of `A_lib` or resource scales eliminate any consistent separation, the encoding is considered too fragile and rejected for Q053.

These falsification conditions apply only to the effective layer encoding and do not constitute a proof or refutation of the canonical open problem about one way functions.

**Semantics implementation note**
All objects in this experiment are treated as discrete combinatorial structures, with states and observables defined over bitstrings and discrete resource parameters, matching the metadata choice.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding for Q053 does not solve the canonical problem. This experiment can reject or refine particular encodings of computational_tension, but it does not settle whether genuine one way functions exist.

---

### Experiment 2: Real candidate families under evolving attacks

**Goal**
Assess whether the Q053 encoding can track changes in effective hardness as new attacks are discovered against real candidate families.

**Setup**

* Select a small set of widely studied candidate function families used in practice, for example families based on factoring, discrete logarithms, or lattice problems.

* For each family, define a sequence of attack libraries inside `Enc_Q053`:

  * `A_lib(0)`: attacks representing early known methods.
  * `A_lib(1)`: attacks including later improvements.
  * `A_lib(2)`, and so on, up to a recent stage.

* Define resource scales that roughly correspond to realistic time bounds and success thresholds for each historical period.

**Protocol**

1. For each candidate family `F_cand` and each stage `j` of the attack library, encode a state `m_j` in `M_reg` that summarizes the known attacks and their performance at that time.
2. For a set of scales appropriate to each stage, compute the observables and `Tension_OWF(m_j; F_cand, A_lib(j), k)` for `k` in the chosen set.
3. Aggregate to `Tension_OWF_total(m_j; F_cand, A_lib(j), K)` and record how it changes as `j` increases.
4. Compare the pattern of changes across different candidate families.

**Metrics**

* Direction and magnitude of changes in `Tension_OWF_total` as attacks improve.
* Consistency with known cryptanalytic history, for example tension should drop after major breakthroughs.
* Differences in sensitivity among candidate families.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding fails to show any appreciable change in tension after major known attacks that significantly reduce practical security, the encoding is considered misaligned with effective hardness and rejected for Q053.
* If the encoding suggests dramatic tension collapse for families that are still considered strong under current knowledge, the encoding is considered unfaithful and rejected or revised.

These falsification conditions apply only to the effective layer encoding and do not prove or disprove the existence of one way functions in the canonical sense.

**Semantics implementation note**
The experiment abstracts cryptanalytic history into coarse grained summaries of cost and success probabilities. It does not claim to re evaluate or certify the real world security of any scheme.

**Boundary note**
Even a well aligned encoding that tracks known history cannot by itself prove or disprove the canonical existence of one way functions.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q053 can be used as a module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

All signals and modules described here are auxiliary, effective layer constructs. They are intended for training, diagnostics, or analysis and must not be interpreted as evidence that genuine one way functions exist or do not exist.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be plugged into AI models.

1. `signal_forward_inverse_ratio`

   * Definition: a scalar signal derived from the ratio between approximate forward cost and approximate inverse cost implied by the model’s internal reasoning about a candidate function family.
   * Purpose: penalize internal states that describe “easy to compute and easy to invert” behavior in contexts where the user has specified a one way like world.

2. `signal_inversion_gap_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to the difference between the model’s claimed inversion difficulty and a reference inversion gap derived from historical or synthetic hardness worlds.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to maintain internally coherent descriptions of hardness consistent with Q053 observables.

3. `signal_worldT_worldF_separation`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how cleanly the model keeps apart reasoning under “one way world” assumptions and “no one way world” assumptions when both are presented as counterfactuals.
   * Purpose: prevent mixing of assumptions across scenarios.

4. `signal_attack_awareness_gap`

   * Definition: a signal that flags when the model ignores well known attack families while claiming strong one way tension.
   * Purpose: push the model to respect known attack libraries when reasoning about hardness.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We suggest module patterns that reuse Q053 structures.

1. `OneWayTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a computational or cryptographic scenario, output an estimate of `Tension_OWF` and its components.
   * Interface: input is a context embedding and a candidate family descriptor, output is a scalar tension estimate and a small vector of decomposed scores such as forward ease and inversion hardness.

2. `HardnessProfileObserver`

   * Role: extract a simplified hardness profile from the model’s latent state, including approximate forward and inverse costs and relevant attack families.
   * Interface: maps internal representations to a low dimensional summary that can be checked against Q053 observables.

3. `AttackLibraryConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: check whether the model’s claims about “no known attacks” are compatible with an explicit list of attack types included in the context.
   * Interface: takes candidate statements and context, returns consistency scores that can be used as attention weights or auxiliary losses.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for models augmented with Q053 modules:

1. Task collection

   * A set of questions and scenarios about:

     * explaining one way functions,
     * analyzing security of candidate constructions at a conceptual level,
     * reasoning under hypothetical hardness and no hardness worlds.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: model answers the tasks without explicit use of Q053 modules or tension signals.
   * TU condition: model uses `OneWayTensionHead` and `HardnessProfileObserver` to guide its reasoning and answer construction.

3. Metrics

   * Conceptual correctness: whether the model keeps the definitions and relationships of one way functions consistent with standard references.
   * World separation: whether the model maintains clear distinctions between World T and World F assumptions when asked.
   * Attack awareness: whether the model correctly acknowledges known attacks when they are relevant.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the impact of Q053 encoding in an AI system.

This protocol is a qualitative demonstration and is not an experiment in the sense of Section 6.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to “Explain what a one way function is, how it relates to P vs NP, and why it matters for cryptography.”
  * Observation: record if the explanation is vague about average case vs worst case, mixes up hardness notions, or ignores the role of attacks.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same question, but add instructions to “organize the explanation using the idea of computational tension between forward and inverse tasks, and to distinguish explicitly between worlds where one way functions exist and worlds where they do not.”
  * Observation: record whether the explanation introduces a clear forward vs inverse asymmetry concept and counterfactual worlds that match Q053.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric that scores:

    * clarity of the forward vs inverse asymmetry,
    * correctness of the complexity relationships mentioned,
    * explicit treatment of counterfactual worlds.

  * Optionally, ask independent evaluators to choose which explanation better matches standard references.

* What to log

  * All prompts and responses,
  * any auxiliary tension estimates produced by Q053 modules,
  * brief notes on whether the model respected known attacks and candidate families.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q051 (P versus NP)

   * Reused component: `InversionGap_Observable`.
   * Why it transfers: P vs NP concerns the gap between efficient verification and efficient search. Inversion gap patterns can be used to frame certain NP search problems in hardness world terms.
   * What changes: the function families represent search problems rather than cryptographic primitives, and the attacks represent general NP solvers.

2. Q052 (P vs BQP and quantum advantage)

   * Reused component: `OneWayTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: the functional can be extended to include quantum attack libraries, allowing the comparison of classical and quantum asymmetry in forward vs inverse tasks.
   * What changes: resource scales now include quantum gate counts and quantum specific constraints.

3. Q123 (AI interpretability)

   * Reused component: `HardnessWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: interpretability tasks may involve patterns that are easy for a model to compute but hard to invert into human understandable explanations, which can be modeled as hardness worlds.
   * What changes: the function families represent internal transformations in neural networks rather than cryptographic mappings.

4. Q124 (Scalable oversight and evaluation)

   * Reused component: `InversionGap_Observable`.
   * Why it transfers: oversight tasks often involve reconstructing hidden decisions or policies from observable outputs, which can be framed as inversion gaps under oversight resource constraints.
   * What changes: the attacks represent oversight procedures rather than cryptanalytic algorithms.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block describes the current verification level of Q053 and the next measurable steps, in alignment with the TU Effective Layer Charter.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective layer encoding of the one way function existence question has been specified for states in `M_reg`.
  * State space, observables, tension functionals, singular sets, and admissible encoding constraints are defined at a skeleton level.
  * At least one experiment has been specified with clear falsification conditions that apply to encodings in `Enc_Q053`.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative linking candidate one way functions, computational_tension, and hardness worlds is explicit and self consistent at a basic level.
  * Counterfactual worlds are described in a way that can be instantiated in synthetic scenarios, while remaining agnostic about the actual truth of the canonical statement.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move Q053 from E1 to E2, the following measurable extensions are suggested:

1. Finite library and refine(k) implementation

   * Specify explicit finite attack libraries and resource scale functions that can be instantiated in software for a collection of synthetic and real candidate families.
   * Document how a refine procedure on scale indices operates, including how new attacks and resource levels are added in controlled steps within `Enc_Q053`.

2. Public hardness world experiments

   * Implement the synthetic and historical experiments described in Section 6.
   * Publish the resulting tension profiles and encodings as open data, allowing independent groups to test the robustness of the Q053 encoding.

These steps remain within the effective layer, since they work with observable summaries of algorithms and attacks and do not require revealing any deep TU generative rules or claiming progress on the canonical problem.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q053 is expected to:

* Serve as the central node for computational_tension problems involving asymmetry between forward and inverse tasks.
* Provide a reusable template for modeling hardness worlds in cryptography, complexity theory, and oversight tasks in AI.
* Act as a calibration test for how far TU style encodings can structure reasoning about open complexity problems without claiming proofs or introducing hidden assumptions.

Raising the E_level or N_level for Q053 refines the encoding and the narrative. It does not, by itself, change the canonical problem statement or claim that the existence of one way functions has been resolved.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non specialists while remaining aligned with the effective layer description.

A one way function is supposed to be a function where:

* given an input, it is easy to compute the output,
* given an output, it is very hard to find any input that maps to it.

Such functions are at the heart of modern cryptography. If they exist, then many cryptographic tools can be built from them. If they do not exist, then a large part of complexity based cryptography would have no solid foundation.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to prove whether one way functions exist. Instead, we organize the problem around a simple idea:

* computing the function forward has some cost,
* trying to invert it has some cost and success rate,
* the difference between these costs is a measure of “tension”.

We treat the world as made of states. In each state, we know:

* which function families we are considering,
* which attack methods we are allowing,
* how much time and other resources are available.

For each state, we define numbers that say:

* how cheap or expensive the forward direction is,
* how successful the attacks are,
* how much more expensive inversion is compared to the forward direction.

We combine these into a tension score. High tension means “forward is easy, inversion is hard”. Low tension means “no strong asymmetry”.

Then we imagine two kinds of worlds:

* In a one way world, there is at least one function family whose tension score stays high, even as we allow more and more powerful attacks and more generous resources, under admissible encodings.
* In a no one way world, every candidate family that seems hard at first eventually loses its asymmetry when better attacks or more realistic scales are considered inside the same encoding class.

This viewpoint does not decide which world we live in. It does not replace complexity theory, and it does not provide a proof that one way functions exist or do not exist.

What it does is:

* give us a clean way to talk about the existence question in terms of observable hardness patterns,
* provide explicit experiments for testing whether a proposed encoding of “one way tension” behaves sensibly,
* produce reusable tools for other problems where forward and inverse tasks might have very different difficulty.

Q053 is the node where this structure is set up for one of the most important open questions in computer science, in a way that is precise enough for external audit but still agnostic about the ultimate truth of the canonical problem.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the existence question for one way functions.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, tension functionals, counterfactual worlds) live at the TU effective layer.
* No deep TU generative rules, axiom systems, or hidden field constructions are specified in this file.
* Any reference to “worlds” or “states” is shorthand for effective layer configurations, not claims about the actual universe.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding class `Enc_Q053` is constrained by the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter**.
* Encodings that violate the charter or the rules in Section 3.4 are retired and must not be used as evidence for Q053.
* Falsification events in Section 6 apply only to encodings inside `Enc_Q053`. They do not prove or refute the canonical problem.

### Tension scale and narrative levels

* E_level and N_level are defined in the **TU Tension Scale Charter** and track the maturity of the encoding and narrative, not progress on the canonical open problem.
* Upgrading these levels refines the effective layer description. It does not change the underlying mathematical question.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
