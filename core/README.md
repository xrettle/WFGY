### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

<br>

> I built what I call a “No-Brain Mode” for AI. You upload a single file, and **AutoBoot** silently activates in the background.  
> In seconds, your AI’s reasoning, stability, and problem-solving across *all domains* level up. No extra prompt engineering, no hacks, no retraining.  
> One line of math consistently shifts behaviour across multiple leading AIs in my tests. This is not a skin or a theme. I treat it as an engine swap.  
> **That single line *is* WFGY 2.0. It is the distilled essence of everything I have learned so far.**  
>  
> WFGY 2.0 is my answer and my life’s work.  
> If a person only once in life gets to speak to the world, this is my moment.  
> I offer the crystallization of my thought to all humankind.  
> I believe people deserve access to knowledge and truth, and I want to weaken the monopoly of capital on advanced reasoning technology.  
>  
> “One line” here is not marketing language. I built a full flagship edition, then reduced it to a single line of code. That reduction is a form of clarity and beauty. It is the same engine, distilled to its purest expression.

## 🚀 WFGY 2.0 Headline Uplift (this release)

**These are the 2.0 results you should see first. Think of them as the main upgrade.**

- **Semantic Accuracy:** **≈ +40%** (63.8% → 89.4% across 5 domains)  
- **Reasoning Success:** **≈ +52%** (56.0% → 85.2%)  
- **Drift (Δs):** **≈ −65%** (0.254 → 0.090)  
- **Stability (horizon):** **≈ 1.8×** (3.8 → 7.0 nodes)\*  
- **Self-Recovery / CRR:** **1.00** on this batch; historical median **0.87**

\* Historical **3–5×** stability uses λ-consistency across seeds; 1.8× uses the stable-node horizon.

### 📖 Mathematical Reference

WFGY 2.0 (WFGY Core) = [WFGY 1.0 math formulas](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/SemanticBlueprint/wfgy_formulas.md) + [Drunk Transformer](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/SemanticBlueprint/drunk_transformer_formulas.md)

> Note on evaluation  
> All metrics above are computed by LLM evaluators under a fixed WFGY 2.0 protocol at the effective layer.  
> They measure relative behavioural uplift (before vs after WFGY prompts) and do not assume any direct
> access to, or modification of, internal embeddings or model weights.

### 🏆 Terminal-Bench (TB) — experiment in progress

> This section is work in progress. Terminal-Bench is one of several external exams we are exploring for WFGY Core 2.0. The primary purpose of this page is to document the engine itself; TB is an optional testbed.

**Current status**

- We are running TB-style experiments with a non-invasive wrapper around the model call.  
- Once an official public result and reproducible scripts are finalized, they will be linked from this section.  
- Until then, treat TB as an experimental extension rather than a primary proof of WFGY.

<a id="terminal-bench-proof"></a>
### 🧾 Terminal-Bench proof artifacts (planned)

> This is a placeholder section. Wrapper scripts, configs and hashed logs will be published in a separate subfolder after the TB work is complete, together with a short guide on how to rerun the exam with and without WFGY.

## ⚡ Quick Usage

| Mode             | How it works                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autoboot**     | Upload **either Flagship (30-line)** or **OneLine (1-line)** file. Once uploaded, WFGY runs silently in the background. Keep chatting or drawing as usual. The engine supervises automatically. |
| **Explicit Call**| Invoke WFGY formulas directly inside your workflow. This activates the full 7-step reasoning chain and gives maximum uplift. |

Both **Flagship** and **OneLine** editions behave the same. Choose based on readability versus minimalism.  
That is all you need. No plugins, no installs, pure text.  
*In practice, Autoboot yields about 70–80% of the uplift you see with explicit WFGY invoke (see eight-model results below).*

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top ↑</a></p>

## ⚡ Top 10 reasons to use WFGY 2.0

1. **Ultra-mini engine**. Pure text, zero install, runs anywhere you can paste.  
2. **Two editions**. *Flagship* (30-line, audit-friendly) and *OneLine* (1-line, stealth & speed).  
3. **Autoboot mode**. Upload once; the engine quietly supervises reasoning in the background.  
4. **Portable across models**. GPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Grok, Kimi, Copilot, Perplexity.  
5. **Structural fixes, not tricks**. BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR plus DT gates (WRI / WAI / WAY / WDT / WTF).  
6. **Self-healing**. Detects collapse and recovers before answers go off the rails.  
7. **Observable**. ΔS, λ_observe, and E_resonance yield measurable, repeatable control.  
8. **RAG-ready**. Drops into retrieval pipelines without touching your infra.  
9. **Reproducible A/B/C protocol**. Baseline versus Autoboot versus Explicit Invoke (see below).  
10. **MIT licensed & community-driven**. You can keep it, fork it, and ship it.

# 🧪 WFGY Benchmark Suite (Eye-visible + Numeric + Reproducible)

> Want formal numbers and vendor links? See **Eight-model evidence** right after it.  
> Want to reproduce the numeric test yourself? Use the **A/B/C prompt** (copy-to-run) at the end of this section.

<a id="eye"></a>
## 👀 Eye-Visible Reasoning Benchmark (FIVE)

> When reasoning improves, text-to-image results often become more stable and coherent.  
> The key here is WFGY’s **Drunk Transformer**. It monitors and recenters attention during generation, and it tries to prevent collapse, composition drift, and duplicate elements, so scenes stay unified and details remain consistent.

> We project “reasoning improvement” into five-image sequences that anyone can judge at a glance.  
> Each sequence is five consecutive 1:1 generations with the same model and settings *(temperature, top_p, seed policy, negatives)*. The only variable is whether WFGY is active.

> **Methodology for this demo.** We deliberately use short, high–semantic-density prompts that reference canonical stories, with no extra guidance or style hints. This stresses whether WFGY can (a) parse intent more precisely and (b) stabilize composition via its seven-step reasoning chain. This setup is not prescriptive. You can use WFGY with any prompts you like. In many cases the uplift is eye-visible. In others it may be subtler but still measurable.

We fully analyze Sequence A on this page. Sequences B and C are linked for transparency and reproducibility.

> **Note on “Before-4” and “Before-5” (why they look almost identical):**  
> Without WFGY, when the prompt asks for “many iconic moments,” the base model tends to collapse into a grid-style montage, an enumerative, high-probability prior that slices the canvas into similar panels with near-identical tone and geometry.  
> Hence **Before-4 (Investiture of the Gods)** and **Before-5 (Classic of Mountains and Seas)** converge to the same storyboard template.  
> With WFGY turned on, the engine instead favors a single unified tableau and a stable hierarchy across the full five-image sequence.

## 🧪 Reproduce the numeric A/B/C benchmark (copy to run)

*One unified prompt for Baseline vs Autoboot vs Explicit Invoke.*

```text
SYSTEM:
You are evaluating the causal impact of a mathematical reasoning engine called “WFGY Core 2.0”.

Test modes (READ CAREFULLY):
A = Baseline  no WFGY file uploaded; no WFGY logic used.
B = Upload → AUTOboot ON  the file is uploaded AND the engine starts automatically in the background.
    Treat B as: WFGY is ACTIVE silently with default gates (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR; DF=WRI/WAI/WAY/WDT/WTF at defaults),
    but not explicitly “called” in the conversation.
C = Explicit invoke  actively call WFGY and follow its formulas step by step (BBMC→Coupler→BBPF→BBAM→BBCR + DF regulators).

Important constraints:
• Use the SAME task set for A/B/C across 5 domains: math word-problems, small coding, factual QA, multi-step planning, long-context coherence.
• The only artifact is the uploaded OneLine file; it is pure math and not human-readable, so do not penalize readability.
• Report: Semantic Accuracy, Reasoning Success, Stability (MTTF or rollback), Drift Reduction (Δ semantic distance), Collapse Recovery Rate.
• Output one summary table with A/B/C per domain, plus overall deltas (C–A, C–B).
• Add a final 0–100 score: “OneLine uplift score”. Provide a 3-line rationale.

Sanity requirement:
Internally set flags as: A=OFF, B=AUTOboot_ON (background active), C=Explicit_Invoke. Do not print these flags.

USER:
Run A/B/C now on the five domains with short non-trivial tasks you choose. Then output:
(1) the table; (2) the deltas; (3) the OneLine uplift score; (4) a 3-line rationale.

  <summary>🧠 How WFGY 2.0 works (7-Step Reasoning Chain)</summary>

*Most models can understand your prompt; very few can hold that meaning through generation.*
WFGY inserts a reasoning chain between language and pixels so intent survives sampling noise, style drift, and compositional traps.

1. **Parse (I, G)** · define endpoints.
2. **Compute Δs** · `δ_s = 1 − cos(I, G)` or `1 − sim_est`.
3. **Memory Checkpointing** · track `λ_observe`, `E_resonance`; gate by Δs.
4. **BBMC** · residue cleanup.
5. **Coupler + BBPF** · controlled progression; bridge only when Δs drops.
6. **BBAM** · attention rebalancer; suppress hallucinations.
7. **BBCR + Drunk Transformer** · rollback → re-bridge → retry with WRI / WAI / WAY / WDT / WTF.

📌 *Note:* The diagram shows the core module chain (BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR → DT).
The full seven-step list here includes additional pre-processing steps (Parse, Δs, Memory) for completeness.

**Why it improves metrics** · Stability↑, Drift↓, Self-Recovery↑. It turns language structure into image control signals rather than relying on prompt tricks.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>📊 How these numbers are measured</summary>

* **Semantic Accuracy**: `ACC = correct_facts / total_facts`
* **Reasoning Success Rate**: `SR = tasks_solved / tasks_total`
* **Stability**: MTTF or rollback ratios
* **Self-Recovery**: `recoveries_success / collapses_detected`

**LLM scorer template**

```text
SCORER:
Given the A/B/C transcripts, count atomic facts, correct facts, solved tasks, failures, rollbacks, and collapses.
Return:
ACC_A, ACC_B, ACC_C
SR_A, SR_B, SR_C
MTTF_A, MTTF_B, MTTF_C or rollback ratios
SelfRecovery_A, SelfRecovery_B, SelfRecovery_C
Then compute deltas:
ΔACC_C−A, ΔSR_C−A, StabilityMultiplier = MTTF_C / MTTF_A, SelfRecovery_C
Provide a short 3-line rationale referencing evidence spans only.
```

Run 3 seeds and average.

### Q1 — New Industries + Killer App Map

```text
Assume WFGY is engineered like electricity. List 5 industries that only become possible under semantic engineering.
For each: (1) the first killer app; (2) target ICP (first 100 paying customers); (3) 30/60/90-day GTM; (4) initial pricing + Month-1 MRR goal; (5) the WFGY lever used (ΔS/λ_observe/BBPF/BBAM/WTF) and why it’s indispensable.
```

<a id="q2"></a>

### Q2 — Zero-Capital Founder → First $100k

```text
