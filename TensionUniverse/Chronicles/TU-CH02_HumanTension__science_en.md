## 1 | What this file is (and is not)

This file is not a new theory of physics or psychology. It does not claim to “explain” human relationships or consciousness in a rigorous scientific way. It is a set of working notes that sit behind the story chronicle “TU-CH02 · Human Tension”, written from the point of view of a junior Tension Historian from the year 2413.

The goals here are much smaller and more practical:

1. To write down a **minimal set of variables** that can describe the kinds of human tension that appeared in the story: crushes, long-term relationships, comparison, jealousy, and the shifting image of “who I should be”.
2. To show how these variables can be treated as **MVP-level models**. They are deliberately simple and incomplete, but they make certain questions easier to ask.
3. To collect **references into the 131-question BlackHole archive** that are relevant for human-scale tension, self, value, information, and multi-agent interaction.
4. To give readers a clear way to **use those 131 questions with AI systems**: translating them, rephrasing them, and mapping them back to their own lives.

If you want formal models, experiments, or proofs, you should go to the technical parts of WFGY: the core engine, the ProblemMap, and the experiments in TensionUniverse/Experiments. This document is a bridge between the narrative and those more formal areas.

## 2 | Minimal variables for human tension

In the TU-CH02 story, we saw three main classes of scenes:

- A message that was read but not answered, and several possible “selves” fighting inside one person.
- A relationship that changed from “shared imagination of a future” to “shared exhaustion under present load”.
- A stream of comparisons that quietly moved the standard for what counts as “enough”.

To talk about these in a more systematic way, we introduce a minimal set of variables. They are not final. They are just the simplest useful handles.

### 2.1 Self layer

At any given moment, we can distinguish at least three self-related objects:

1. `self_now`  
   This is the person’s current state: their actual situation, skills, history, constraints, and concrete reality. It is not just their body, but also their lived story up to this point.

2. `self_ideal`  
   This is the internal picture of “who I should be”. It is a mixture of personal values, childhood narratives, cultural expectations, and imported images from media. It changes over time, often without explicit consent.

3. `self_projected`  
   This is the imagined version of “how others see me”. It is built from reactions, silence, praise, criticism, likes, and the person’s own fears. It may be very different from how others actually see them.

A first approximation of self-tension can be written as:

- self_tension_now ≈ distance(self_now, self_ideal)  
- social_self_tension ≈ distance(self_now, self_projected)

Here “distance” is not a fixed metric. In practice it may combine material gaps (income, health, time) and symbolic gaps (status, meaning, story). For TU purposes we treat it as a scalar: larger distance, higher tension.

### 2.2 Relationship layer

For a relationship between two people, we add at least two more objects:

1. `shared_imagination(t)`  
   A time-dependent object that represents the thickness and reach of the shared future. It includes all the “we” stories: places the pair wants to go, projects they want to start, ways they want to grow together. At time t, it has a certain richness, length, and coherence.

2. `maintenance_load(t)`  
   The combined weight of all tasks, obligations, and responsibilities the pair is already carrying at time t: bills, childcare, eldercare, work stress, health issues, and accumulated friction.

A rough sketch of relationship tension could be:

- relationship_tension(t) ≈ a(t) * gap_to_shared_future(t) + b(t) * maintenance_load(t)

where:

- gap_to_shared_future(t) ≈ “how far today’s reality is from the shared_imagination(t)”
- a(t) controls how strongly the pair still cares about the future
- b(t) controls how heavy the existing load feels

In early phases of a relationship, a(t) is usually large and gap_to_shared_future(t) is a sweet kind of tension: “we are not there yet, but it feels worth walking toward”. Later, if shared_imagination(t) becomes thin and maintenance_load(t) becomes high, b(t) may dominate. The same relationship can move from “tension toward a future” to “tension just to prevent collapse”.

### 2.3 Comparison and re-pricing of self_ideal

Comparison and jealousy do not only add new desires. They also **move** self_ideal.

When a person repeatedly encounters highlight clips of other people’s lives (wealth, success, aesthetics, family, freedom), the internal standard for “acceptable me” can drift upwards, sometimes very far beyond what their environment can support.

A simple way to describe this is:

- self_ideal(t+1) = self_ideal(t) + delta_imported(t)

where delta_imported(t) is the change in self_ideal induced by a wave of external signals (feeds, advertising, social pressure, cultural narratives).

If self_now does not change as fast as self_ideal, then self_tension_now will increase over time even if the person’s objective conditions are stable or improving.

This is one way to model the feeling of “objectively my life is okay, but subjectively I feel like I am failing”.

## 3 | Mapping the story cases to variables

With these variables in hand, we can go back to the three story patterns and see how they might look in this minimal model.

### 3.1 The unread reply

In the story, a simple message that was read but not answered produced a storm of internal versions:

- “Maybe they do not like me.”
- “Maybe they like me a lot and are pretending not to care.”
- “Maybe they are just busy and I am overthinking.”

In variable form:

- self_now is fixed: you sent a message, you are waiting.
- self_projected branches into several drafts:
  - self_projected_A: “I am annoying or embarrassing.”
  - self_projected_B: “I am attractive but must be careful.”
  - self_projected_C: “I am not important enough to be a priority.”

The tension here does not come from changes in the world. It comes from multiple candidate self_projected versions competing to become “the one that will be remembered as true”.

We can think of this as a local superposition in the self layer:

- {self_projected_A, self_projected_B, self_projected_C} are different drafts of the same field.
- The body reacts (heart rate, stomach, thoughts) as if several possible futures are partially real at once.
- The moment a later event happens (for example, a reply that clarifies the situation), one draft becomes “official”, the others become “what could have been”.

From the tension ledger view:

- Until a decision or event collapses the branch, self_tension_now is not just a single number. It is closer to a distribution over several possible self-image configurations.
- Ruminating is a way of repeatedly sampling from this distribution without closing the ledger entry.

### 3.2 The relationship that moves from future-tension to maintenance-tension

Early stage:

- shared_imagination(t) is thick: many branches, rich detail, long horizon.
- maintenance_load(t) is relatively low: fewer joint obligations.
- a(t) is high: both care deeply about the future they see together.
- b(t) is moderate: the current load is tiring but feels meaningful.

In this phase:

- relationship_tension(t) is dominated by a(t) * gap_to_shared_future(t).
- The pain of not being there yet is balanced by the sweetness of “we are walking toward it together”.

Later stage:

- shared_imagination(t) may thin out: fewer branches, shorter horizon, less detail.
- maintenance_load(t) increases: more bills, more responsibilities, more accumulated friction.
- a(t) may drop for one or both partners: fatigue, disillusionment, or simple overload.
- b(t) increases: the same tasks feel heavier when they no longer point clearly to a shared “why”.

Now:

- relationship_tension(t) is dominated by b(t) * maintenance_load(t).
- Even if gap_to_shared_future(t) is smaller, the felt tension can be worse, because a(t) has dropped and the future feels less alive.
- The relationship can sit in a local minimum where “leaving” and “staying” both feel painful. There is no easy direction of movement that clearly reduces total tension.

This is one way to formalize the subjective feeling of “we are still together, but mostly we are managing the same disaster”.

### 3.3 Comparison as a slow re-pricing of self_ideal

In the story, the person scrolls through feeds full of sports cars, sea-view apartments, and early financial freedom. Objectively, their own life may be stable or even improving. Subjectively, the feeling of “being behind” grows.

In the minimal model:

- self_now(t) moves slowly: income, skills, social network, and so on.
- self_ideal(t) moves faster, driven by delta_imported(t): a constant stream of images and narratives that redefine what “normal success” looks like.
- The self_tension_now(t) ≈ distance(self_now(t), self_ideal(t)) grows simply because the target point marches away.

This leads to a simple but important effect:

- Even if absolute conditions improve, the perceived gap can widen.
- The person can feel worse while “objectively” becoming better off.

From a tension historian’s view, this is not a paradox. It is a basic pattern of how tension baselines can be hijacked when a system is exposed to an environment that constantly broadcasts unrealistic or uncontextualized standards.

The same structure can be scaled up from individuals to whole societies, where self_ideal becomes “what kind of civilization we think we must be” and delta_imported includes global media, geopolitics, and technological expectations.

## 4 | Related 131 questions (human-scale tension index)

The [`TensionUniverse/BlackHole`](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/TensionUniverse/BlackHole) folder contains 131 S-class questions, Q001 to Q131. They are written in Effective Layer language and are meant to act as X-ray machines: however you answer them, they reveal how your worldview handles tension.

For human-scale tension, several clusters of questions are especially relevant. This section lists them so that you can treat this file as an index.

All links below are absolute GitHub URLs into the BlackHole archive. The exact slugs after the Q numbers may evolve as the repository grows, but the question IDs themselves are stable.

### 4.1 Mind, consciousness, self, and identity

These questions touch the nature of mind, experience, and what it means for a “self” to persist over time. They are natural extensions of the internal conflicts in TU-CH02.

### 4.2 Social comparison, inequality, and economic tension

These questions take self_ideal and comparison patterns and move them into economic and social scales.

### 4.3 Multi-agent tension, AI, and alignment (for later chapters)

These questions are not directly about human crushes or relationships, but they extend the same patterns into AI and multi-agent systems. They become important when you connect human tension to AI companions, recommender systems, and governance.

## 5 | How to use these questions with AI

The questions listed above are written for humans and machines at the same time. Each one is a compressed description of a tension pattern. You can use them as prompts, test cases, or mirrors.

Here is a simple way to work with them using any large language model (LLM):

1. **Pick one or two questions that resonate with you.**  
   They might match a current problem in your life, your research, or your worries about the future.

2. **Open the corresponding file in the BlackHole archive.**  
   Read the full question, including any subcases or suggested observables.

3. **Copy the text into an AI system you trust.**  
   This could be ChatGPT, Claude, or any other LLM. Ask it to:
   - translate the question into your preferred language;
   - explain the question in simpler words;
   - rephrase the question using the human tension variables from this file (self_now, self_ideal, self_projected, shared_imagination, maintenance_load);
   - or map the question to a concrete story similar to TU-CH02.

4. **Compare the AI’s explanation with your own intuition.**  
   Notice where you agree, where you feel “this misses something”, and where completely new angles appear. These differences are themselves tension signals.

5. **Optionally, ask the AI to generate new thought experiments.**  
   For example: “Create three short human stories that illustrate Q113 in everyday life”, or “Show me how Q101 would look inside one person’s career”.

You do not need to accept any answer as final. The point is not to let the AI close the ledger for you. The point is to use AI as a tool to rotate the question, to see different slices of the same tension structure, and to make your own internal map clearer.

All of this remains within the frame stated at the top:

This is speculative science fiction.  
“Tension Universe” is a fictional framing device.  
The 131 questions are not oracles. They are invitations.

If they help you think more clearly about your own tension, or design better experiments, or write better stories, then they have done their job.
