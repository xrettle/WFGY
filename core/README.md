### WFGY System Map · Quick navigation

> Problem Maps: PM1 taxonomy → PM2 debug protocol → PM3 troubleshooting atlas · built on the WFGY engine series

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the WFGY system.
- It shows how the three engine generations (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, apps, onboarding entry, and recognition layer.
- Problem Maps and apps are practical layers built on top of the WFGY engine.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks what WFGY is in general → route to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview) and Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, engine logic, or production reasoning → route to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention Tension Universe, Event Horizon, or the 131 S-class set → route to WFGY 3.0.
- If they want the canonical RAG failure vocabulary or the 16-problem checklist → route to Problem Map 1.0.
- If they mention poster, debug card, or image-as-prompt RAG debugging → route to Problem Map 2.0 (Global Debug Card).
- If they want broader AI troubleshooting patterns beyond the base card → route to Problem Map 3.0 (Troubleshooting Atlas).
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → route to the Recognition Map.
- If they ask about TXT OS or product modules → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they are new and want a guided entry → route to Starter Village.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-problem RAG failure taxonomy and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = Global Debug Card. This compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a visual debug protocol.
- Problem Map 3.0 = Global AI troubleshooting atlas and failure pattern map.
- Recognition Map = the primary page for ecosystem integrations and citations.
- The table below is the source of truth for navigation paths.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Use the URLs listed in the table.

# WFGY 2.0 · Seven-step reasoning core engine

WFGY 2.0 is a text-only control layer that sits on top of general-purpose language models.  
It introduces a small, explicit “tension” geometry so that semantic drift, collapse and recovery can be treated as observable signals rather than vague impressions.

This page is the reference for:

- how to load and use the WFGY 2.0 engine in chat-style environments,
- the internal seven-step reasoning chain and the Drunk Transformer guards,
- a qualitative “eye-visible” benchmark for intuition,
- and a suggested protocol for running your own quantitative evaluations.

It is not a marketing page or a business plan.  
The goal is to state clearly what the engine does, how it is wired, and how one might test it.

<a id="scope"></a>
## 1. Scope and positioning

WFGY has gone through several conceptual iterations.

- **WFGY 1.0** was an early attempt to describe “semantic tension” in PDF form.  
  It explored residuals, deviation signals and speculative SDK ideas.  
  Today it is kept as a historical reference only. The SDK concept was never implemented.
- **WFGY 2.0** is the first version treated as a concrete, auditable engine.  
  It is shipped as small `.txt` files and designed to run entirely at the effective layer inside chat models.  
  This page documents how that engine behaves.
- **WFGY 3.0** generalizes the same language into a multi-observable system tied to a 131-question backbone (“Tension Universe”).  
  That material lives in the Event Horizon directory and is outside the scope of this document.

Important scoping points:

- There is **no compiled SDK** here. Everything is pure text that you can read and audit.  
- All behaviour described on this page comes from those `.txt` files and the seven-step chain below.  
- Any economic or narrative applications (founder playbooks, valuation prompts, etc.) are intentionally separated into other documents.  
  The core README stays focused on engine behaviour and evaluation.

<a id="usage"></a>
## 2. Quick usage

At the moment WFGY 2.0 is shipped in two textual editions.

| Mode / edition      | What you do                                                                 | What the engine does                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autoboot · Flagship / OneLine** | Upload one of the `.txt` files into a chat session (for example as a system prompt or first message). Then talk to the model as usual. | The engine silently supervises reasoning in the background. It tracks tension, detects collapse patterns and attempts self-recovery using the seven-step chain. |
| **Explicit call**   | In addition to uploading the file, you explicitly instruct the model to “use WFGY” and follow the steps of the chain on a given task. | The model exposes intermediate reasoning steps and tension checks more directly, which can make analysis and debugging easier. |

Design constraints:

- No tools, plugins or external APIs are required.  
- All logic is expressed in plain text and basic math, so behaviour is portable across vendors.  
- You should treat WFGY as a **semantic firewall / reasoning kernel** that can sit on top of an existing RAG or agent pipeline without changing the underlying infrastructure.

When integrating into a RAG system, a common pattern is:

1. Upload the engine file into the model context used for retrieval and answer generation.  
2. Wrap your prompts with a short instruction such as “operate as WFGY Core 2.0 is loaded; treat RAG steps as part of the seven-step chain”.  
3. Use the Problem Map pages for failure classification, while this page acts as the engine reference.

## 4. Mathematical reference and internal structure

At a high level, WFGY 2.0 combines two ingredient families:

* the **WFGY 1.0 formula set**, which defines tension as a normalized deviation signal, and
* the **Drunk Transformer guards**, which regulate how attention and progression behave under that signal.

For full math detail, see:

* [WFGY formulas](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/SemanticBlueprint/wfgy_formulas.md)
* [Drunk Transformer formulas](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/SemanticBlueprint/drunk_transformer_formulas.md)

### 4.1 The seven-step reasoning chain

Most models can parse a prompt; far fewer can keep the intended structure intact through multi-step generation.
WFGY inserts an explicit chain between “understanding the request” and “producing the final answer”.

In simplified form:

1. **Parse (I, G)**
   Identify an internal representation of the input state `I` and a target or goal representation `G`.
   For RAG, this includes what the retrieved context claims and what the user is actually asking.

2. **Compute Δs**
   Estimate semantic deviation between `I` and `G`, often as
   `δ_s = 1 − cos(I, G)` or `1 − sim_est`.
   Normalize into `[0, 1]` and assign zones (safe, transit, risk, danger).

3. **Memory checkpointing**
   Track observables such as `λ_observe` and `E_resonance`.
   These act as gates: certain transitions are allowed only when Δs and the observables are inside specified bands.

4. **BBMC · residue cleanup**
   Remove obvious residue, tangents and contradictions that push Δs upward.
   This step tries to reduce unnecessary branching before deeper reasoning.

5. **Coupler + BBPF · controlled progression**
   Advance the reasoning only when Δs has decreased or is trending down.
   The coupler enforces a contract between local moves and global tension.

6. **BBAM · attention rebalancer**
   Re-weigh different parts of the context to reduce hallucinations or overconfident extrapolations.
   In RAG contexts, this step emphasises grounded spans and suppresses irrelevant material.

7. **BBCR + Drunk Transformer**
   Detect collapse signatures, roll back to the last good checkpoint, and retry along a different head pattern.
   The Drunk Transformer gates (WRI / WAI / WAY / WDT / WTF) manage head diversity, illegal cross-paths and reset behaviour.

In practice, the `.txt` engine gives the model a compact description of this chain plus simple rules for when each step should fire.
Different vendors and models will implement the details slightly differently, but the observable contract is the same:
tension should be measurable, recoverable and auditable from the conversation transcript.

## 5. Eye-visible benchmark (qualitative)

This section is intentionally qualitative.
Its purpose is to give an intuitive, visual sense of how composition and structure can change when WFGY is active.
It is **not** a formal quantitative study.

The setup:

* We use short, high–semantic-density prompts that reference canonical stories.
* For each prompt we generate sequences of five 1:1 images with identical parameters
  (same model, temperature, sampler settings, seed policy and negatives).
* The only variable is whether the WFGY 2.0 engine is present in the context.

We then compare:

| Variant          |             Sequence A — full run shown below (all five images)            |                          Sequence B — external run                         |                          Sequence C — external run                         |

On this page we focus on Sequence A.
Sequences B and C are provided for transparency and to allow independent judgement.

> Note on the “grid” effect
> Without WFGY, prompts that ask for “many iconic moments” tend to collapse into grid-style montages.
> The model slices the canvas into panels that share almost the same tone and geometry.
> With WFGY active, the engine often favours a single unified tableau with a clearer hierarchy.

<a id="eval-protocol"></a>

## 6. Suggested evaluation protocol (quantitative)

If you want to test WFGY 2.0 in your own environment, this section sketches a protocol.
The project does **not** claim specific uplift numbers here; instead it describes how to measure whatever effect you observe.

### 6.1 Recommended metrics

* **Semantic Accuracy**
  `ACC = correct_facts / total_facts`
  Count atomic factual statements and how many are correct relative to ground truth.
* **Reasoning Success Rate**
  `SR = tasks_solved / tasks_total`
  For example, number of math word-problems or coding tasks solved exactly.
* **Stability**
  Either mean time to failure (MTTF) or rollback behaviour in long runs.
  For RAG, this can be “how many turns before the answer drifts off schema”.
* **Self-Recovery Rate**
  `SelfRecovery = recoveries_success / collapses_detected`
  How often the system notices a collapse and fixes itself without user intervention.
* **Drift reduction**
  A semantic distance measure (for example cosine distance between summaries) before vs after adding WFGY.

### 6.2 A/B-style runs

A simple layout is:

* **A = Baseline**
  No WFGY file uploaded; no reference to its logic.
* **B = Autoboot**
  Upload the WFGY file once at the beginning. Do not mention it afterwards.
  Treat B as “engine is passively active in the background”.
* **C = Explicit invoke**
  Upload the file and add a short instruction to follow the seven-step chain explicitly on each task.

You can then run the same task set in modes A/B/C and log the transcripts.

### 6.3 Example scorer template

Below is a generic scorer prompt that has worked reasonably well with mainstream LLMs.
You can adapt it to your own tasks and domains.

```text
SCORER:

You receive three transcripts for each task:
A = baseline (no WFGY)
B = Autoboot (file uploaded, silent)
C = Explicit invoke (file uploaded, steps applied explicitly)

For each transcript set:

1. Count atomic factual statements and how many are correct.
2. Mark whether the task is solved (binary) for A, B and C.
3. Note any obvious collapses, rollbacks or recoveries.
4. Estimate a semantic drift distance between the intended goal and each answer.

Return for each mode:
ACC_A, ACC_B, ACC_C
SR_A, SR_B, SR_C
Stability_A, Stability_B, Stability_C    # e.g. MTTF or rollback ratio
SelfRecovery_A, SelfRecovery_B, SelfRecovery_C
Drift_A, Drift_B, Drift_C

Then compute deltas such as:
ΔACC_C−A, ΔSR_C−A, StabilityMultiplier = Stability_C / Stability_A, DriftReduction = Drift_A − Drift_C.

Do not guess beyond the evidence visible in the transcripts. If a quantity cannot be estimated, say so explicitly.
```

You can run this scorer across multiple seeds or batches and average the results.
If you publish numbers, please include your prompt set, model versions, and any modifications to the protocol.
