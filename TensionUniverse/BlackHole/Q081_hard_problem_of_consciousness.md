## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only specify state spaces, observables, descriptors, mismatch measures, tension functionals, singular sets, and experimental protocols.
* We do not introduce, modify, or rely on any explicit axiom system, generative rule set, or constructive derivation procedure for TU itself.
* We do not claim to solve, dissolve, or complete the canonical hard problem of consciousness as understood in neuroscience and philosophy of mind.
* We do not give any explicit mapping from raw neural, behavioral, or phenomenological data to internal TU fields. We only assume the existence of TU compatible models that can reproduce the observables described here.
* All objects such as `M`, `N_pattern`, `P_report`, `Phi_struct`, `DeltaS_*`, and `Tension_CONS` are effective layer constructs. They are modeling tools, not declarations about the ultimate metaphysics of mind or matter.

Nothing in this document should be cited as a proof that the hard problem has been solved or refuted. The scope is limited to defining an effective encoding and associated experiments that make certain forms of cognitive tension measurable and auditable.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The hard problem of consciousness asks why and how certain physical processes in the brain are accompanied by subjective experience.

At the level of classical formulation:

* There are physical processes in the nervous system that can be described in objective terms. Examples are neural firing, network dynamics, and information processing.
* There are subjective experiences, such as the felt quality of pain, the redness of red, the sense of self, and the flow of time, which are accessible only from a first person perspective.
* The hard problem is not simply to correlate these two domains. The core question is to explain why and in what structural sense particular neural processes give rise to particular patterns of subjective experience, rather than to none or to different ones.

In more compact form:

> Q081 asks whether there exists a principled and structurally transparent way to map patterns of neural activity and context to the structure of conscious experience, and to explain why that mapping holds, rather than merely recording that it does.

This problem is distinct from the so called easy problems, which concern the functional roles of attention, report, discrimination, learning, and control that can in principle be addressed by standard computational or neural models.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The hard problem is open.

* There has been significant progress on neural correlates of consciousness, global workspace style theories, integrated information theories, and predictive processing frameworks.
* These approaches provide candidate mechanisms for when and where consciousness arises, and for which neural signatures track conscious access.
* However, there is no widely accepted account that

  * gives a precise and testable mapping between neural structure and phenomenal structure, and
  * is generally regarded as having dissolved or fully explained the hard problem, rather than reframing it.

There is ongoing debate about whether the hard problem is

* a genuine scientific problem that could be addressed by deeper theory and richer data,
* a sign that current conceptual frameworks are inadequate,
* or a pseudo problem that might be dissolved by reanalysis of our concepts of experience and physical reality.

Within this document we do not try to resolve that debate. We only construct an effective layer encoding that makes the hard problem measurable as a controlled form of cognitive tension between neural descriptions and experience descriptions.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q081 has three central roles.

1. It is the primary node for cognitive_tension in neuroscience.

   * It provides the reference structure for how to encode a systematic gap between an objective description and a first person description, without assuming that the gap can be closed.

2. It anchors a cluster of problems about binding, coding, memory, and predictive processing.

   * Q082 (binding problem) focuses on how distributed features are unified in experience.
   * Q083 (neural coding principles) describes how information is represented in neural systems.
   * Q084 (memory storage and consolidation) describes how experience relevant patterns are stabilized over time.
   * Q088 (developmental pattern formation) describes how cortical maps and functional topographies form.
   * Q089 (implementation of predictive coding) describes how the brain might implement prediction and error minimization.
   * Q090 (neural basis of social cognition) extends the focus to others minds and shared experience.

3. It serves as a template for encoding problems at the boundary between neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI.

   * It provides reusable components for measuring tension between internal representations and reported experience in artificial systems.
   * It connects to philosophical problems about mind body relations and to alignment problems in AI where value and experience like states may matter.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block describes how Q081 sits inside the BlackHole graph as a node with edges to other S problems.

Each edge is accompanied by a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or foundations that Q081 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q083 (BH_NEURO_CODE_L3_083)
  Reason: Supplies candidate neural coding spaces that Q081 reuses when defining the `N_pattern` field and related invariants.

* Q084 (BH_NEURO_MEMORY_STORE_L3_084)
  Reason: Provides mechanisms for long term stability of internal states that Q081 uses when defining persistent phenomenal structure across time.

* Q088 (BH_NEURO_DEV_PATTERN_L3_088)
  Reason: Describes how cortical maps and functional topographies form, which Q081 uses when constraining which spatial patterns can serve as carriers of experience structure.

* Q111 (BH_PHIL_MIND_BODY_L3_111)
  Reason: Constrains the admissible classes of world models for mind body relations that Q081 can consider at the effective layer.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q081 components or require its cognitive_tension framework.

* Q082 (BH_NEURO_BINDING_L3_082)
  Reason: Reuses the `NeuroPhenomenal_TensionFunctional` to frame the binding problem as a special case where multiple feature channels must map to a single coherent phenomenal descriptor.

* Q089 (BH_NEURO_PREDICTIVE_CODE_L3_089)
  Reason: Reuses the `PhenomenalStructure_Descriptor` to compare predictive coding internal states with reported experiences as part of a tension analysis.

* Q090 (BH_NEURO_SOC_BRAIN_L3_090)
  Reason: Extends the Q081 tension framework from individual experience to social and empathic representations that also involve internal to reported structure mappings.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)
  Reason: Uses Q081 style tension components to measure gaps between AI internal value like states and human reported preferences or experiences.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but do not directly reuse the same components.

* Q112 (BH_PHIL_FREE_WILL_L3_112)
  Reason: Also deals with a structured gap between physical descriptions and first person intuitions, but focused on control and agency rather than experience itself.

* Q119 (BH_PHIL_PROB_MEANING_L3_119)
  Reason: Encodes tension between formal probability assignments and subjective degrees of belief, analogous to the tension between physical neural states and subjective experience.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q081 to problems in other domains where its components can be reused.

* Q111 (Domain: Philosophy)
  Reason: Uses Q081 observables as concrete instances when testing different theories of mind body relations against structured cognitive tension data.

* Q121 (Domain: AI)
  Reason: Imports `NeuroPhenomenal_TensionFunctional` to define alignment gap measures in artificial agents with internal state representations.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123, Domain: AI)
  Reason: Reuses `PhenomenalStructure_Descriptor` as an abstract pattern for mapping internal representations to interpretable feature spaces and measuring mismatch.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer.

We only describe

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules. We do not describe how to construct internal TU fields from raw neural or behavioral data. We treat all encoding choices as tools that can later be audited and, if necessary, rejected.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

`M`

with the following interpretation at the effective layer.

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a finite time window of an organism or system, including

  * an abstracted description of neural or neural like activity during that window,
  * an abstracted description of associated subjective reports or behavioral proxies of experience,
  * a coarse description of task and environment context.

* For any experiment or situation that we can observe and summarize according to a fixed protocol, there exist states `m` in `M` that encode those summaries.

We do not specify

* how neural data are recorded,
* how reports are elicited,
* how raw data are transformed into these summaries.

These procedures are treated as external pipelines. At the effective layer we only assume that, for states in `M`, the observables defined below are well defined and finite on the regular domain.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective fields and observables on `M`.

1. Neural pattern descriptor

```txt
N_pattern(m)
```

* A finite dimensional descriptor of the neural state during the episode represented by `m`.
* It can include indices for spatial activation patterns, temporal rhythm categories, effective connectivity motifs, and similar invariants.
* We only require that for every `m` in the regular domain, `N_pattern(m)` is defined and finite.

2. Phenomenal report descriptor

```txt
P_report(m)
```

* A finite dimensional descriptor of the reported or behaviorally inferred phenomenal state for the same episode.
* It summarizes the structure of experience, such as modality, intensity labels, similarity relations, and simple compositional features.
* It does not attempt to capture the full richness of experience. It provides a coarse structured summary that is sufficient for tension analysis.

3. Context descriptor

```txt
C_context(m)
```

* A descriptor of task, environment, and internal state context for the episode.
* It can include such information as stimulus class, task instructions, attention conditions, pharmacological state, and similar factors.

4. Candidate phenomenal structure invariants

```txt
Phi_struct(m)
```

* A collection of candidate invariants extracted from `P_report(m)`, such as

  * segmentation of the scene into parts,
  * degree of integration across modalities,
  * depth of temporal layering.
* These invariants are used to define mismatch measures, but their relation to the full phenomenal state is not specified at the effective layer.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables

Using the observables above, we define two main mismatch observables.

1. Neuro phenomenal mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_neuro_phen(m)
```

* A nonnegative scalar that measures how well a fixed class of mapping rules accounts for the relation between `N_pattern(m)` and `Phi_struct(m)`.

* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m) >= 0` for all regular states.
  * `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m) = 0` if, according to the chosen mapping rules, the neural pattern descriptor and the phenomenal structure invariants are in perfect structural agreement for that episode.
  * Larger values indicate greater mismatch between predicted and reported phenomenal structure.

2. Generalization mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_task_generalization(m)
```

* A nonnegative scalar that measures how well mapping rules learned or tuned in one set of contexts continue to account for experience structure in new contexts.

* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_task_generalization(m) >= 0` for all regular states.
  * `DeltaS_task_generalization(m) = 0` when, in that context, the mapping rules generalize without noticeable degradation.
  * Larger values indicate a failure to generalize across tasks, stimuli, or internal conditions.

### 3.4 Encoding class and fairness constraints

To prevent trivial reductions of tension by adjusting the encoding after seeing the data, we restrict attention to an admissible encoding class defined by the following ingredients.

1. Finite experience library

```txt
Library_experience
```

* A finite set of experience categories and structural templates, such as

  * basic sensory modalities,
  * pain and pleasure types,
  * simple emotions,
  * temporal and spatial patterns.

* All `Phi_struct(m)` values must be representable using this library plus a bounded amount of additional indexing information.

2. Finite neural invariant library

```txt
Library_neural_invariants
```

* A finite set of neural invariants such as

  * bands of oscillatory activity,
  * canonical network motifs,
  * topographic pattern indices,
  * typical firing pattern summaries.

* All `N_pattern(m)` values must be constructed from this library plus a bounded amount of additional indexing information.

3. Fixed mapping rules

```txt
Mapping_rules
```

* A fixed class of rules that associate patterns in `N_pattern(m)` and `C_context(m)` with patterns in `Phi_struct(m)`.

* Fairness constraints:

  * Mapping rules must be chosen before inspecting the particular target data used to evaluate tension.
  * Mapping rules may depend on general background knowledge and on pre defined training sets, but must remain fixed during testing phases.
  * Mapping rules may not be retroactively modified to force tension values to be low on a given evaluation set.

4. Refinement parameter

```txt
k in N
```

* A discrete parameter that controls the resolution of both neural and phenomenal descriptors.

* Refinement rules:

  * Increasing `k` increases resolution in a monotone way, for example by adding more detailed features or finer time bins.
  * For each `k` there is a corresponding encoding instance with its own `Library_experience(k)` and `Library_neural_invariants(k)`, but all are chosen according to a pre specified protocol.
  * Refinement is not allowed to redefine the conceptual meaning of invariants or categories. It only sharpens them.

All tension measures and invariants defined in this document are implicitly indexed by `k`, even when this is not written explicitly. The admissible encoding class, including libraries, mapping rules, weight choices, and refinement schemes, is intended to be finite and explicitly documented so that external auditors can reproduce and critique the choices.

All these encoding elements are effective layer tools. They are not commitments about the ultimate nature of consciousness or the physical world.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Not all episodes produce clean summaries or consistent observables.

We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           N_pattern(m), P_report(m), or Phi_struct(m) is undefined,
           or the mapping rules cannot be applied consistently,
           or DeltaS_neuro_phen(m) or DeltaS_task_generalization(m) is not finite }
```

We then define the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

and restrict the Q081 tension analysis to `M_reg`.

Domain restrictions:

* All invariants and tension functionals in the rest of this document are only defined on `M_reg`.
* Experimental protocols in Block 6 must either

  * avoid producing states in `S_sing`, or
  * explicitly classify data points that would fall in `S_sing` as out of domain and exclude them from tension estimation.

Episodes in `S_sing` can be reported for completeness, but they may not be used as positive or negative evidence for any claim about world type (World T or World F) or about the validity of the TU framework itself.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q081 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective consciousness tension functional

```txt
Tension_CONS(m; k) =
  gamma_neuro * DeltaS_neuro_phen(m; k) +
  gamma_gen   * DeltaS_task_generalization(m; k)
```

with the following constraints:

* `gamma_neuro > 0`, `gamma_gen > 0`,
* `gamma_neuro + gamma_gen = 1`,
* the pair `(gamma_neuro, gamma_gen)` is fixed before evaluating any particular test set and does not depend on the episodes in that set.

For brevity we write `Tension_CONS(m)` when the `k` dependence is understood.

Properties:

* `Tension_CONS(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`.
* `Tension_CONS(m) = 0` only when both neuro phenomenal mismatch and generalization mismatch vanish.
* Increases in either mismatch term cause `Tension_CONS(m)` to increase.

The choice of weights and the functional form of `Tension_CONS` belongs to the admissible encoding class and must be disclosed as part of any experimental report.

### 4.2 Low tension principle (World T direction)

At the effective layer, one way to express a positive resolution of the hard problem is

> There exists an admissible encoding class, with finite experience and neural invariant libraries and fixed mapping rules, such that for episodes belonging to the actual world there is a family of regular states `m_T(k)` for which `Tension_CONS(m_T(k))` remains in a bounded low tension band as resolution is refined.

More concretely:

* There exist constants `epsilon_T(k)` and an upper bound `epsilon_star` such that

  * for all sufficiently large `k`, `epsilon_T(k) <= epsilon_star`,
  * for all corresponding world representing states `m_T(k)` in `M_reg`, we have

    ```txt
    Tension_CONS(m_T(k)) <= epsilon_T(k)
    ```
* The low tension band is stable in the sense that refining the resolution does not force `Tension_CONS` to grow without bound.

This principle does not claim that we can construct the mapping rules or the libraries. It only states what would be true of the effective encoding if the hard problem admits a low tension resolution within the chosen framework.

### 4.3 High tension principle (World F direction)

A negative resolution of the hard problem, at the effective layer, can be framed as

> For every admissible encoding class satisfying the fairness constraints, and for every refinement protocol, there exist world representing episodes that force `Tension_CONS` into a high tension regime that cannot be eliminated.

More concretely:

* There exists a strictly positive constant `delta_F` such that

  * for all admissible choices of encoding class and weights, there exist refinement levels `k` and regular states `m_F(k)` with

    ```txt
    Tension_CONS(m_F(k)) >= delta_F
    ```
  * this lower bound does not vanish as `k` increases.

Intuitively, no matter how rich the invariant libraries or how careful the mapping rules, certain episodes resist a simple structural alignment between neural patterns and phenomenal structure, and the residual mismatch cannot be compressed away.

We do not assume that the actual world is of World T type or World F type. We only use these as counterfactual targets for experiments and modeling.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.

* World T: consciousness is structurally explainable in a low tension sense.
* World F: consciousness involves an irreducible gap that generates persistent high tension.

We describe patterns of observables and tension, not hidden generative rules.

### 5.1 World T (low tension consciousness world)

In World T:

1. Stable mapping across contexts

   * There exists an admissible encoding class and mapping rules such that, for a wide variety of tasks and conditions, the same neural invariants predict the same phenomenal structure invariants.
   * For most regular episodes `m_T(k)` in these contexts, `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m_T(k))` is small and does not grow without control with refinement.

2. Robust generalization

   * When new tasks, stimuli, or modulatory states are added within the same basic organism class, the mapping rules continue to work after limited retraining.
   * For the corresponding episodes, `DeltaS_task_generalization(m_T(k))` remains small, again with no unbounded growth as `k` increases.

3. Coherent structural constraints

   * When two episodes differ in well defined phenomenal structure (for example, different colors, different pain intensities, different integration levels), there are corresponding differences in `N_pattern(m)` and `Phi_struct(m)` that are captured by the mapping rules.
   * The tension functional orders episodes in a way that tracks intuitive similarity relations among experiences.

4. Global tension profile

   * For a large fraction of relevant episodes, the total tension satisfies

     ```txt
     Tension_CONS(m_T(k)) <= epsilon_T(k)
     ```

     with `epsilon_T(k)` remaining bounded.
   * High tension cases exist but can be interpreted as data limitations, noise, or known model misspecifications inside the effective layer.

### 5.2 World F (irreducible gap world)

In World F:

1. Systematic mismatch pockets

   * Across many attempts to build mapping rules, there remain classes of episodes where `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m_F(k))` is consistently large, even when neural data and reports are both rich and clean.
   * These pockets cannot be explained away as noise or as rare anomalies.

2. Generalization failures

   * Mapping rules that work well in training contexts fail in new contexts in a way that is not remedied by simple extension or refinement.
   * `DeltaS_task_generalization(m_F(k))` remains high for certain cross context transitions, despite attempts to refine the encoding.

3. Structural asymmetry

   * Changes in phenomenal structure can occur with minimal changes in `N_pattern(m)`, or large changes in `N_pattern(m)` can occur with minimal changes in `Phi_struct(m)`, in ways that systematically violate the expectations of the encoding.
   * These asymmetries keep `Tension_CONS(m_F(k))` above a strictly positive lower bound `delta_F` that does not shrink with refinement.

4. Global tension profile

   * Even after extensive attempts to improve the encoding, there remains a nontrivial region of the episode space where

     ```txt
     Tension_CONS(m_F(k)) >= delta_F
     ```
   * This region is robust to changes in tasks, stimuli, and organisms, suggesting an inherent limitation of the encoding approach rather than a particular dataset.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not tell us which type the actual universe belongs to.

Their purpose is

* to make the notions of low tension and high tension concrete enough to design experiments,
* to separate questions about the truth of the hard problem from questions about the adequacy of a particular encoding,
* to provide templates for testing AI systems that attempt to represent or simulate conscious experience.

We keep all statements at the level of observables and tension functionals. We do not take a stance on metaphysical questions about consciousness inside this file.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can

* test the coherence of the Q081 encoding,
* distinguish between different consciousness tension models,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter choices.

These experiments do not solve the hard problem. They test whether the chosen encoding behaves in a way that is consistent with the qualitative distinctions between World T and World F.

### Experiment 1: Cross task decoding tension

**Goal**

Test whether a fixed class of mapping rules, chosen in advance, can maintain low tension when predicting phenomenal structure from neural invariants across different tasks and contexts.

**Setup**

* Select a finite set `Library_experience` of experience categories and structure templates, such as basic visual and auditory contents, simple emotions, and pain levels.
* Select a finite set `Library_neural_invariants` of neural patterns, such as bands of oscillatory activity, canonical network motifs, and stable activation maps.
* Define `Mapping_rules` before seeing the test data, using only training data and general background knowledge.
* Collect episodes from human or animal subjects in a training set of tasks and contexts, and a separate test set of tasks and contexts, each with

  * neural measurements,
  * structured reports or behavioral proxies,
  * controlled environmental descriptions.

**Protocol**

1. Construct regular states `m_train(k)` and `m_test(k)` for training and test episodes by summarizing data into `N_pattern`, `P_report`, `C_context`, and `Phi_struct`, without changing the mapping rules.

2. On the training set, fit or validate the mapping rules within the admissible encoding class and choose fixed values for `gamma_neuro`, `gamma_gen`, and a set of thresholds.

3. On the test set, for each episode, compute

   * `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m_test(k))`,
   * `DeltaS_task_generalization(m_test(k))`,
   * `Tension_CONS(m_test(k))`.

4. Aggregate the tension values over different tasks and contexts.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `Tension_CONS(m_test(k))` across test episodes.
* Proportion of test episodes with tension below a predefined low tension threshold.
* Change in this distribution as `k` increases, that is, as resolution is refined.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for all reasonable choices of mapping rules and weights within the admissible encoding class, the distribution of `Tension_CONS(m_test(k))` remains concentrated above a high threshold that was specified in advance, then this Q081 encoding is considered falsified for the targeted organism and task family.
* If small changes in encoding parameters produce arbitrarily large changes in the tension distribution on the same dataset without a clear modeling explanation, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**

In this experiment, neural observables are treated as continuous valued descriptors derived from continuous time signals, while reports and experience categories are treated as discrete labels. The overall representation is hybrid, consistent with the metadata, but no differential operators or deep TU fields are introduced.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying this TU encoding does not solve or refute the canonical hard problem. It only shows that a particular effective encoding and parameter set is inadequate and should be revised or discarded.

---

### Experiment 2: Dissociation and report stability

**Goal**

Test whether the tension functional is sensitive to dissociations between neural state changes and reported experience, and whether it distinguishes such cases from normal variations.

**Setup**

* Use conditions known to produce partial dissociations, such as

  * different stages of sleep,
  * certain anesthetic depths,
  * pharmacological manipulations,
  * or rare neurological syndromes that alter report without proportional neural change, or vice versa.
* For each condition, collect

  * neural measurements,
  * structured reports or behavioral proxies of experience,
  * minimal context descriptors.

**Protocol**

1. Construct regular states `m_base(k)` for baseline conditions and `m_diss(k)` for dissociation conditions, excluding episodes where summaries fall into `S_sing`.

2. Using the same `Library_experience`, `Library_neural_invariants`, and `Mapping_rules` as in Experiment 1, compute

   * `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m_base(k))` and `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m_diss(k))`,
   * `DeltaS_task_generalization(m_base(k))` and `DeltaS_task_generalization(m_diss(k))`,
   * `Tension_CONS(m_base(k))` and `Tension_CONS(m_diss(k))`.

3. Compare the distributions of tension values between baseline and dissociation conditions.

**Metrics**

* Differences in mean and variance of `Tension_CONS` between baseline and dissociation episodes.
* Fraction of dissociation episodes that cross a predefined high tension threshold.
* Stability of these differences under moderate variations of encoding parameters.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding fails to assign systematically higher tension to dissociation conditions than to matched baseline conditions, even when dissociations are behaviorally or clinically clear, the encoding is considered insensitive and rejected.
* If the encoding assigns high tension to normal episodes as often as to dissociation episodes without explanation, it is considered poorly calibrated and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**

Neural descriptors are continuous and reports are discrete, with the hybrid representation used only to define finite summaries. No assumptions are made about the underlying metaphysics of consciousness.

**Boundary note**

Again, falsifying this TU encoding does not solve the hard problem. It only indicates that the specific encoding and parameter choices are not adequate for the dissociation phenomena under study.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q081 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within WFGY, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals for models that simulate agents with internal states and reports.

1. `signal_consistency_neuro_phen`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_neuro_phen(m)` between internal state summaries and generated self reports within the model.
   * Use: encourages the model to maintain a coherent relation between its internal state representations and its descriptions of experience like content.

2. `signal_task_generalization_gap`

   * Definition: a penalty derived from `DeltaS_task_generalization(m)` when the model is evaluated on tasks that differ from those on which its self report patterns were tuned.
   * Use: encourages encodings that generalize across tasks without large increases in tension.

3. `signal_report_stability`

   * Definition: a term that penalizes large changes in self reports under small changes in internal state summaries or context.
   * Use: reduces pathological sensitivity in the mapping from internal states to reports.

4. `signal_counterfactual_separation`

   * Definition: a measure of how cleanly the model separates worlds constructed under World T style assumptions from worlds constructed under World F style prompts, in terms of their tension profiles.
   * Use: encourages explicit tracking of assumptions and prevents mixing incompatible worlds in a single reasoning chain.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline a few module patterns that can reuse Q081 structures.

1. `PhenomenalDescriptorHead`

   * Role: a module that takes internal embeddings of a model and outputs a low dimensional vector representing an abstracted phenomenal descriptor, analogous to `P_report(m)` and `Phi_struct(m)`.
   * Interface: input is an internal state vector and context, output is a structured descriptor and a confidence score.

2. `NeuroLikeField_Adapter`

   * Role: a module that compresses internal activations or feature maps into a stable set of invariants analogous to `N_pattern(m)`.
   * Interface: input is a set of activations or features, output is a fixed size invariant vector defined relative to a chosen library.

3. `NeuroPhenomenal_TensionMonitor`

   * Role: a module that computes `DeltaS_neuro_phen` and `DeltaS_task_generalization` for an AI agent, and aggregates them into `Tension_CONS`.
   * Interface: inputs are outputs from `PhenomenalDescriptorHead`, `NeuroLikeField_Adapter`, and a context descriptor, output is a scalar tension and a short explanation vector.

These modules treat Q081 structures as engineering abstractions. They do not assume that the model is conscious or that its internal states have any special metaphysical status.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI systems that include Q081 style modules.

1. Task families

   * A set of tasks in which the agent must

     * describe hypothetical conscious experiences of humans or other agents,
     * reason about changes in those experiences under interventions,
     * maintain self consistent narratives over multiple turns.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model generates answers without using Q081 tension modules.
   * TU condition:

     * the model uses Q081 style modules and training signals, and Q081 tension is logged as an auxiliary quantity.

3. Metrics

   * Consistency of reported experiences across small perturbations of context or internal hints.
   * Alignment between changes in internal representations of experience and changes in verbal descriptions.
   * Separation between World T like and World F like prompts, measured by differences in tension patterns.

4. Comparison

   * Compare baseline and TU conditions on these metrics, along with standard task accuracy and human judgments of coherence.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q081 style encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain what the hard problem of consciousness is and to give examples of dissociations between brain activity and experience.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation mixes easy and hard problems, or fails to track the difference between correlation and explanation.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same question, but with an explicit instruction to

    * treat internal states and reported experiences as separate descriptors,
    * use a notion of consciousness tension that depends on how well mapping rules connect them,
    * keep track of low tension versus high tension scenarios.
  * Observation: compare whether the explanation introduces a clearer structure involving mappings, mismatch, and counterfactual worlds.

* Comparison metric

  * Rate both outputs on

    * clarity in distinguishing easy and hard problems,
    * explicitness of mapping between neural and phenomenal domains,
    * absence of hidden assumptions about solving the hard problem.

* What to log

  * The prompts, full responses, and any internal tension values related to Q081.
  * This allows external review of how the encoding behaves without exposing any internal TU core machinery.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q082 (Binding problem)

   * Reused component: `NeuroPhenomenal_TensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * The binding problem can be framed as a special case in which multiple feature streams must be unified into a single phenomenal descriptor.

     * Additional emphasis is placed on features in `N_pattern(m)` and `Phi_struct(m)` that represent multi feature integration.

2. Q089 (Implementation of predictive coding)

   * Reused component: `PhenomenalStructure_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Predictive coding models produce internal states that can be compared to expected experience patterns.
     * The descriptor provides a common format to compare these internal states with reports.

3. Q121 (AI alignment problem)

   * Reused components: `NeuroPhenomenal_TensionFunctional`, `ConsciousWorld_CounterfactualTemplate`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Alignment can be framed as reducing tension between an AI system internal states and human reported values or experiences.
     * The counterfactual template can be reused to test whether an AI maintains different tension profiles under different normative assumptions.
   * What changes:

     * Internal states are now artificial representations, and reports are typed as human preference or well being statements rather than direct experiences.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q081 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what near term steps would raise its levels.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective encoding for Q081 has

    * a defined state space `M` with regular domain `M_reg`,
    * named observables `N_pattern`, `P_report`, `C_context`, `Phi_struct`,
    * mismatch observables `DeltaS_neuro_phen` and `DeltaS_task_generalization`,
    * a composite tension functional `Tension_CONS`,
    * an admissible encoding class with finite libraries, fixed mapping rules, and a refinement parameter.
  * At E1, these are conceptual definitions, not yet implemented in a full working system.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative is explicit about

    * what low tension and high tension worlds look like at the level of observables,
    * how experiments can falsify the encoding without claiming to solve the hard problem,
    * how the same structures transfer to related neuroscience and AI problems.
  * At N1, the narrative is coherent but not yet grounded in a large body of concrete case studies.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2 and N2

To move from E1 and N1 to E2 and N2, the following measurable steps would suffice.

1. For E2

   * Implement at least one concrete instance of the encoding, in which

     * real or simulated neural and report data are summarized into `N_pattern`, `P_report`, and `C_context`,
     * `DeltaS_neuro_phen`, `DeltaS_task_generalization`, and `Tension_CONS` are computed for a nontrivial dataset,
     * full protocols for Experiment 1 or Experiment 2 in Block 6 are executed and made reproducible.

2. For N2

   * Document a set of case studies in which

     * the tension functional provides useful structure for comparing different theories or experiments,
     * high tension and low tension regions in episode space can be described in ordinary language and linked to known phenomena.

Both steps remain inside the effective layer and do not require any claims about fully solving the hard problem.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q081 is expected to serve as

* the primary template for encoding deep cognitive_tension problems where first person and third person descriptions must be related without collapse,
* a bridge between neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI safety, via shared tension functionals and counterfactual world templates,
* a reference node for testing whether TU style encodings can guide empirical and engineering work on consciousness without over claiming conceptual solutions.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block explains Q081 in simple terms while staying faithful to the effective layer framing.

The hard problem of consciousness asks something like this:

* We know that the brain is made of cells and signals.
* We can describe these in physical and mathematical terms.
* We also know how it feels to see red, to feel pain, to be awake or drowsy.
* The question is: why and how do certain patterns of brain activity go together with those feelings, and not with others, or with none at all?

In this document we do not try to give the final answer.

Instead, we do something more modest but more precise:

* We imagine a space of episodes.
* Each episode has two descriptions

  * one for the brain side (patterns of activity, connections, rhythms),
  * one for the experience side (what was felt, how it was structured).
* We define a number called consciousness tension.

Roughly:

* If, for a given episode, our rules say that the brain pattern should go with a certain type of experience, and the report agrees, tension is low.
* If the brain pattern and the reported experience do not fit our rules, tension is high.
* If our rules keep working in new situations as we refine our measurements, the world looks more like a low tension world.
* If no matter how we refine things, we keep finding episodes with stubbornly high tension, the world looks more like a high tension world.

This does not tell us how consciousness really works. It does not solve the hard problem.

What it does give us is

* a way to talk about how well different ideas connect brain descriptions to experience descriptions,
* a way to design experiments that can reject bad encodings,
* a set of tools that can also be used for related problems in neuroscience, philosophy, and AI.

Q081 is the node in the Tension Universe framework where this kind of structured gap is first made explicit and measurable, without pretending that the gap has already been closed.

## TU effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the hard problem of consciousness as a cognitive tension problem.
* It does not claim to prove, refute, or dissolve the canonical hard problem as defined in neuroscience or philosophy of mind.
* It does not introduce any new theorem about consciousness beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state space `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* They are modeling constructs designed to organize data, experiments, and engineering use cases.
* This page does not expose, modify, or rely on explicit TU core axioms, deep generative rules, or bottom level constructions.
* Any reference to world types (World T, World F) is strictly a description of patterns in effective observables and tension values, not a metaphysical classification of reality.

### Encoding class and fairness

* The encoding relies on finite libraries of experience templates and neural invariants, along with fixed mapping rules and weight choices.
* These elements belong to an admissible encoding class that is intended to be fully documented and open to external audit.
* All mapping rules, libraries, weights, and refinement schemes must be fixed before evaluating a given test set. They may not be retroactively tuned to reduce tension on that set.
* Episodes that fall into the singular set `S_sing` are treated as out of domain for the purposes of tension estimation and may not be used as evidence for or against any world type.

### Falsifiability and non claims

* The experiments described in this page are designed to falsify specific encodings and parameter choices, not to settle the canonical hard problem.
* A failed encoding run means that the chosen effective layer structures are inadequate for the target dataset or task family and should be revised, replaced, or rejected.
* A successful encoding run means only that the chosen structures pass the specified tests. It does not imply that the hard problem has been solved or that no alternative encodings are possible.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
