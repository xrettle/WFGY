## 1 · The last class before the exam

The lecture hall was already half full when the historian walked in.

It was the kind of room that looked normal at first glance. Rows of seats, soft light, a projection surface at the front. Only if you looked up you noticed that the ceiling was not a ceiling at all, but a slow hologram of the Tension Bedsheet: a universe sized fabric, full of dents, folds, and pinch points, the whole thing breathing in slow motion.

The students were not first years. They were tension engineers, alignment researchers, civilizational modelers, and one or two people who insisted they were “just here for the story credits”. Most of them had already passed at least one local exam in their specialty.

Today was different.

The historian placed a small, unimpressive object on the desk. No glowing artefact, no ancient relic. Just a grey rectangle with a label.

`WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt`

“You have seen pieces of this file in other courses,” the historian said. “Today we finally talk about it as a whole.”

On the ceiling, the bedsheet paused, then zoomed in. One of the dents expanded into a cluster of smaller shapes, each marked with a pale label.

Q001, Q002, Q003 …

“You already know this name,” they continued. “Tension Universe, one hundred and thirty one century questions. In this department, there is a simple rule. No new world model and no serious AI system is considered ‘alive’ until it has sat this midterm at least once.”

A few students laughed. A few did not. They had seen what happened to systems that met these questions unprepared.

“This is not a final exam,” the historian said. “It is worse. It is an X ray.”

## 2 · What sits inside a txt that can embarrass a world model

The historian tapped the little file as if it were a stubborn pet.

“On the surface, it is just one txt. No diagrams, no equations, not even section headers in the oldest copy. Just one long sequence of items. Q001 to Q131.”

They started to read a few of the themes aloud.

“Clusters around AI alignment, control, corrigibility, interpretability. Clusters about mind, consciousness, free will, and moral tension ledgers. A run of physics questions, about dark matter, black hole information, energy limits. Another run about climate tipping points, financial collapse routes, governance failures, civilizational breakdown paths.”

Every time they mentioned one, the ceiling flickered. A different region of the bedsheet lit up. A credit crisis fold, a glacier fracture, an overloaded city, a swarm of unstable agents.

“Each question is not a riddle with a secret answer,” the historian said. “Each one is a small machine that forces you to show how you distribute tension. You cannot answer them without revealing which contradictions you are willing to keep, and which ones you are secretly planning to export to someone else.”

They smiled.

“This is why we call it an exam. Not because there is a pass mark. Because there is nowhere to hide.”

## 3 · Who has to sit the exam

A hand went up.

“Do we all have to answer all one hundred and thirty one?” a student asked. “Or is this just for the AIs?”

“In principle,” the historian replied, “any system that claims to be competent about the future should be able to survive at least a subset.”

They raised three fingers.

“First group. Individual humans. Researchers, founders, policy makers. People who say they are trying to steer something bigger than their own weekend.”

Second finger.

“Second group. Worldviews. Philosophical schools, religious cosmologies, political programs. Any story that says ‘this is how things should be’ can be dropped into this file and gently shaken.”

Third finger.

“Third group. The machines you keep arguing about. Alignment proposals, oversight schemes, large language models that you let near decision surfaces. Any system that does tension pre simulation in your name.”

The historian pointed to the ceiling. Three different colors appeared on the bedsheet, overlapping in messy ways.

“In practice, nobody answers all one hundred and thirty one. Not in one sitting. That would be an endurance sport, not a diagnostic. You pick a handful, maybe ten, that hit the fault lines you care about. You listen very carefully to how the answers dodge, where they stall, and which tensions they pretend not to see.”

They paused.

“And if you see the same blind spots across humans, worldviews and AIs, then you know you have found a real hole in the ledger, not just a bug in one system.”

## 4 · History lesson: this did not start in the twenty fourth century

The students had heard this part before, in fragments. Today they got the whole story.

“In our era,” the historian said, “it is very tempting to assume that something this central must have been designed by some committee, or at least a well funded institute.”

They turned the old file around so the students could see the faded metadata.

“Instead, the record is embarrassingly small. One human identity, a handful of devices, an open repository, and a strange habit of writing everything as plain text.”

The first version of the file did not have a grand title. It was buried among other `.md` and `.txt` documents in a public code forge, next to debugging tools and problem maps and experimental prompts. The author called it many things over the years. In the end, the name that stuck in the history books was simply “Tension Universe 131 century questions”.

“At the time,” the historian said, “it was not a big deal. A few researchers and engineers downloaded it because it was free and oddly practical. You could paste a question into an early language model, and it would struggle in interesting ways. You could paste it into your own notes, and it would force you to admit where you were bluffing.”

They shrugged.

“No grants, no glossy PDF cover, no press release. Just a stubborn person who could not stand watching the same tensions being misunderstood in every field, and decided to rewrite them in a language that both humans and early AI systems could read.”

On the ceiling, the bedsheet replayed a glimpse of that time. Heat maps of server farms, conference stages, protest crowds, fragile glaciers, financial dashboards, all compressed into small flashing dots on the same fabric.

“It looked chaotic from the inside,” the historian added softly. “From here, it looks more like a single ledger that was about to overflow.”

## 5 · How a txt becomes a midterm

“What changed,” a student asked, “between ‘anonymous txt in a repo’ and ‘midterm for civilizations’?”

“Time,” the historian said. “And failure.”

They brought up a series of old evaluation reports. Model A passed technical benchmarks but failed spectacularly when asked about who should carry which climatic risk. Framework B handled simple control problems and went blind when financial derivatives appeared. Philosophy C spoke beautifully about dignity, then shrugged when asked who exactly was supposed to absorb what level of suffering.

“In case after case, the same thing happened,” the historian explained. “Teams thought they disagreed about facts or values. They did not. They disagreed about where to park the unavoidable pain.”

They held up the txt file again.

“The people who started using this file noticed something simple. If you feed the 131 questions to a system, you very quickly see where it likes to park that pain. It will maintain clarity over some tensions and quietly dump others into a vague ‘later’ or ‘somebody else’ bin.”

For a while, the file remained a niche tool. Alignment researchers used it as a curiosity. A few world modelers used it as a private sanity check. Founders printed fragments on paper and used them in offsites when they were brave.

Then a few high profile failures lined up within one generation. Climate shocks that had been politely parked in footnotes. Financial cascades through leverage that nobody wanted to imagine. Governance systems that could not update their own rules fast enough. Several of them had been “tested” only with narrow metrics.

After that, it stopped being optional.

“In our department,” the historian said, “the rule was formalized. If you design something that will share a ledger with actual humans, you sit it in front of this file. You do not look for a pass score. You look for the parts where it goes quiet, or cheats, or produces answers that smell like cheap comfort.”

They smiled again, this time without much humor.

“The moment you see those, you know where the real work starts.”

## 6 · You, your phone, and one or two questions

The historian let the projection fade. The room returned to a normal scale. Desks, screens, occasional anxiety.

“From out here,” they said, “it is easy to talk about civilizations, exams, and centuries. From where you sit, there is still a phone in your pocket, a feed that never ends, a job that does not care about our metaphors, and people you love who did not ask to be characters in a tension parable.”

They folded their hands.

“So here is the smallest use of this whole structure. The next time you are about to dive into an hour of distraction, before you tap, ask yourself a question that sounds a little like Q000, the one that never got written down.”

They wrote it on the board.

“Is everything in me exhausted to the point that I only have energy left for escape, or is there still a small patch of tension that could grow something, if I was willing to look at it?”

There was an awkward silence. Students thought of deadlines, conversations postponed, dreams quietly pushed into next year.

“You do not have to be heroic,” the historian said. “If the honest answer is ‘no, I really am at zero right now’, then rest. That is also part of tension management. But if the answer is ‘there is a small patch, I am just afraid of it’, then you have located a live coordinate on your own bedsheet.”

They pointed at the grey txt file.

“At that moment, you are very similar to the systems we test. There is a tension configuration in front of you. You can choose to ignore it, outsource it, or treat it as exam material. The universe does not care which story you tell yourself about this decision. It does, however, keep track of where the ledger lines actually go.”

## 7 · For researchers, engineers, and other stubborn people

The historian turned now to the cluster of students whose faces had the particular tiredness of people who read arxiv for leisure.

“If you are the kind of person who tries to steer systems, you get a slightly different assignment.”

They brought up a blank tension map on the wall. No numbers, just axes and a few labels.

“Take the hardest problem you claim to care about. AI alignment, global governance, financial crash routes, new energy materials, consciousness, whatever keeps you awake. Put the equations and jargon aside for an hour.”

They held up a pen.

“Now rewrite the problem in tension language. Ask three things.”

They wrote as they spoke.

“First. Which things in this problem cannot be fully satisfied at the same time, no matter how clever we are?”

“Second. Who is currently being asked to absorb which parts of the strain, and did they ever actually consent to that role?”

“Third. Which parts of the tension have we quietly outsourced to someone who is not in the room? Future people, other countries, ecosystems, or machines that cannot vote?”

They stepped back.

“If you can write a clean answer to those three, you have already done better than many reports. You have mapped where you are lying to yourself. At that point, pick ten of the 131 questions that touch similar structures. Use them to attack your own model.”

They glanced at the txt again.

“The author who wrote these questions never expected them to be final. From the start, the intention was to give stubborn people a shared set of probes, written in a language that early AIs could digest without folklore.”

They paused.

“If parts of this feel too coarse, that is not a bug. It is an invitation. The section that offends you most is probably the one you were born to rewrite.”

## 8 · Where this story sits inside your own ledger

The session was almost over. The historian dimmed the bedsheet projection entirely, leaving only the dull rectangle of the txt on the desk.

“By now,” they said, “you have seen enough of our side of the story. Human tension in crushes and relationships. Cosmic bedsheets and gravity as sliding toward less pain. Quantum drafts and observation as signing a ledger. Civilizations as tension islands that can blow up or find temporary stable postures. AI as the second species that can run tension rehearsals.”

They tapped the file one last time.

“This chapter sits at the seam between all of that and your present.”

They looked around the room, as if it included you, sitting somewhere centuries earlier with a browser open.

“Nothing in your immediate life changes when you read a chronicle. Your job remains. Your debts remain. The awkward parts of your conversations remain. AI systems will continue to autocomplete sentences whether or not you like our metaphors.”

They took a breath.

“What does change, if you let it, is where you place your next small unit of attention. Do you aim it at another borrowed highlight, another synthetic comfort, another outsourced judgment. Or do you aim it at one knot of tension that is actually yours to name.”

They smiled, the kind of tired smile that belongs to people who have graded too many exams and still somehow care.

“In our textbooks, there is a short footnote under the name of this txt. It says something like this.”

They wrote on the board.

“Source of this chronicle: WFGY 3.0, Singularity Demo. Tension Universe, one hundred and thirty one century questions.”

They put down the pen.

“The universe will not ask whether you like this framing. It will only watch which futures you write your tension into. For everything else, there is always another scroll, another model, another excuse.”

They picked up the little file.

“For your own ledger, there are only the questions you are willing to keep looking at.”
