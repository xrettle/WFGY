## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

More precisely:

1. We only define:

   * a coarse grained state space `M_ocean`,
   * effective observables on `M_ocean`,
   * scalar and tensor valued tension quantities built from these observables,
   * a finite admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q094)` that specifies how these quantities are combined for this problem.

2. We do not specify:

   * any underlying axiom system or constructive rules for a TU core,
   * any microscopic fluid dynamics model,
   * any exact mapping from raw observational or model data to elements of `M_ocean`.

   All such mappings are treated as external procedures that produce summaries compatible with the metadata in this file.

3. We do not claim:

   * to solve the canonical deep ocean mixing and circulation problem described in Section 1,
   * to provide a unique or complete physical theory of deep mixing or overturning,
   * to introduce any new theorem in physical oceanography beyond what is already present in the cited literature.

4. The admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q094)` is a finite set.
   Each `e` in `A_enc(Q094)` consists of:

   * a finite library of regions `L_region` and basins `L_basin`,
   * a finite library of tracer labels `L_tracer`,
   * a pair of rational weights `(w_energy, w_tracer)` with `w_energy > 0`, `w_tracer > 0`, `w_energy + w_tracer = 1`,
   * a finite table of thresholds

     ```txt
     (epsilon_energy, epsilon_tracer, epsilon_mix)
     (delta_energy,   delta_tracer,   delta_mix)
     ```

     with `epsilon_* >= 0` and `delta_* > 0`.

   For this page, the header field

   ```txt
   Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1
   ```

   selects a single element `e*` in `A_enc(Q094)` that fixes all these choices for Sections 3 to 9.

5. All experiments and protocols in Section 6 are defined relative to the encoding element selected by `Encoding_key`.
   Changing thresholds, weights, or libraries in a way that goes beyond their documented uncertainty ranges is treated as a change of encoding and requires a new encoding key.

6. Falsifying an encoding or a subfamily in `A_enc(Q094)`:

   * does not refute any candidate TU core,
   * does not solve the canonical physical problem in Section 1,
   * only shows that the particular effective layer encoding is misaligned with data, physical constraints, or engineering needs.

Readers should treat this document as an effective layer specification and test harness for the deep ocean mixing and circulation problem, not as a proof, not as a complete physical theory, and not as evidence that any open physical problem has been resolved.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q094 can be stated as follows.

Deep ocean mixing and large scale overturning circulation together must close the global budgets of:

* heat,
* mechanical and buoyancy related energy,
* key tracers such as carbon and nutrients,

on climate time scales that range from decades to millennia.

The open question is whether there exists a coherent and physically consistent description of deep ocean mixing and circulation that:

1. respects known constraints from observations and theory on energy input, dissipation, and stratification,
2. reproduces observed deep tracer and heat distributions within credible error bounds,
3. remains stable under refinement of models and data, instead of requiring ad hoc or unphysical mixing structures.

Informally:

> Can we describe deep ocean mixing and circulation in a way that closes the global energy and tracer budgets without violating physical constraints, and that remains coherent as we look more closely at the system?

This canonical problem is not a single theorem to prove. It is a coupled inference and consistency task. The question is whether there exists an effective description of deep mixing and overturning that satisfies all known constraints at once and does so in a way that is robust to improved resolution and observations.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key points about the current scientific status:

1. Observations show that the deep ocean is stratified yet weakly mixed. Mixing is driven by processes such as internal wave breaking, boundary turbulence, and mesoscale eddies. Direct measurements are sparse in space and time.
2. The large scale overturning circulation connects surface and deep waters across basins and between hemispheres. It is sensitive to wind forcing, buoyancy fluxes, and small scale mixing.
3. Energetic arguments show that only a finite amount of mechanical energy is available to drive diapycnal mixing. This constrains how strong deep mixing can be while remaining physically plausible.
4. Tracer and heat distributions in the deep ocean indicate that real mixing is highly inhomogeneous. Some regions exhibit enhanced mixing, others very weak mixing.
5. Climate models require parameterisations of deep mixing and overturning that are not uniquely determined by theory and limited data. Different choices can lead to different projections of heat uptake, carbon storage, and circulation changes.

Because of these factors, the problem of defining a unified and physically consistent description of deep ocean mixing and circulation remains open. It is not classified as a single classical conjecture, but it has the character of an S level structural problem. The difficulty arises from:

* multi scale dynamics,
* limited observations,
* strong coupling between energy, stratification, mixing, and circulation,

and from the requirement that any proposed description must satisfy several independent constraints at the same time.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q094 plays several roles.

1. It is the main Earth system node for thermodynamic_tension in the physical ocean, focusing on how energy input, mixing, and circulation jointly determine deep ocean states.

2. It links climate sensitivity and carbon cycle problems, such as:

   * Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091),
   * Q093 (BH_EARTH_CARBON_CYCLE_L3_093),

   to the physical transport and storage mechanisms in the ocean interior.

3. It provides a template for encoding, at the effective layer:

   * small scale turbulence and mixing,
   * large scale circulation pathways,
   * global budget closure,

   inside a single tension functional.

4. It serves as an example of a problem where the system is both mathematically complex and observationally incomplete, so any encoding must handle domain restrictions and singular sets explicitly.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q094 sits inside the BlackHole graph as edges among Q001–Q125.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These nodes provide prerequisites, tools, or general frameworks that Q094 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_TURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: Supplies turbulence and cascade concepts used to interpret how small scale motions generate effective mixing coefficients in the ocean interior.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Provides global energy balance constraints that any deep mixing and circulation configuration must satisfy on climate time scales.

* Q093 (BH_EARTH_CARBON_CYCLE_L3_093)
  Reason: Encodes carbon cycle frameworks that restrict how deep ocean mixing and overturning can store and release carbon in the Earth system.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These nodes reuse Q094 components or treat Q094 tension patterns as constraints.

* Q099 (BH_EARTH_WATER_STRESS_L3_099)
  Reason: Reuses deep mixing and overturning templates to propagate freshwater and salinity anomalies and to assess long term water stress patterns.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: Uses deep ocean storage and transport as slow components in Anthropocene scale response and recovery trajectories.

* Q100 (BH_EARTH_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)
  Reason: Reuses ocean circulation pathways and mixing templates when reasoning about marine related pollutant or pathogen transport that influences environmental and health risk.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Nodes here share similar tension types but do not depend on Q094 at the module level.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Both treat thermodynamic_tension between energy input, storage, and dissipation across Earth system compartments, though Q091 is global and Q094 is ocean focused.

* Q092 (BH_EARTH_TIPPING_L3_092)
  Reason: Both involve multistable circulation states and slow fast dynamics, but they operate on different state spaces and stability structures.

* Q095 (BH_EARTH_BIODIVERSITY_L3_095)
  Reason: Both depend on transport and storage processes that control long term ecological patterns, yet Q095 focuses on biodiversity and ecosystems rather than physical mixing.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These edges connect Q094 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Reuses thermodynamic_tension ideas that link microscopic dissipation and macroscopic energy budgets in complex systems.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Uses Q094 as a physical analogy for the thermodynamic cost of mixing and information dissipation in computational and information processing systems.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We describe:

* the state space,
* effective fields and observables,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular set and domain restriction,
* the admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q094)`,
* the link to the TU tension tensor.

We do not describe any hidden generative rule or construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 State space

We introduce a state space

```txt
M_ocean
```

with this interpretation:

* Each element `m` in `M_ocean` represents a coarse grained deep ocean configuration that contains:

  * vertically resolved summaries of mixing coefficients and stratification,
  * large scale overturning circulation summaries,
  * regional energy and tracer budgets over chosen time windows.

We assume that:

* There is a finite library of regions and basins,

  ```txt
  L_region = { R_1, ..., R_N }
  L_basin  = { B_1, ..., B_M }
  ```

  and each `m` provides fields and summaries on these elements.

* The construction of `m` from raw data or model output is not described in TU terms. It is treated as an external procedure that yields well defined summaries consistent with the metadata.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We define the following effective fields and observables on `M_ocean`. All outputs are real valued and finite for states in the regular domain introduced later.

1. Mixing coefficient field

```txt
K_mix(m; R_k, z_bin)
```

* Input: state `m`, region `R_k` in `L_region`, vertical bin index `z_bin`.
* Output: effective diapycnal mixing coefficient for that coarse cell.
* Interpretation: summarises the net impact of small scale turbulence and internal wave breaking.

2. Overturning circulation summary

```txt
Psi_overturn(m; B_j, depth_bin)
```

* Input: state `m`, basin `B_j` in `L_basin`, vertical bin index `depth_bin`.
* Output: scalar summarising the strength and direction of large scale overturning at that depth in that basin.
* Interpretation: coarse summary of overturning streamfunction structure.

3. Energy budget mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_energy(m; R_k)
```

* Input: state `m`, region `R_k`.

* Output: nonnegative scalar measuring the mismatch between:

  * mechanical and buoyancy related energy input,
  * storage and dissipation,

  in region `R_k` over a chosen time window.

* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_energy(m; R_k) >= 0` for all states in the regular domain.
  * `DeltaS_energy(m; R_k) = 0` when the encoded budgets close within the accepted tolerance.

4. Tracer budget mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_tracer(m; B_j, tracer_type)
```

* Input: state `m`, basin `B_j`, tracer label such as heat or carbon.

* Output: nonnegative scalar measuring inconsistency between:

  * deep tracer distributions implied by `K_mix` and `Psi_overturn`,
  * observed or externally specified tracer distributions,

  for that tracer in basin `B_j`.

* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_tracer(m; B_j, tracer_type) >= 0`.
  * `DeltaS_tracer(m; B_j, tracer_type) = 0` when implied and observed tracer fields agree within the accepted tolerance.

### 3.3 Combined mixing tension inputs

Using an encoding element `e` in `A_enc(Q094)` we specify:

1. Weight constraints

   From `e` we obtain two positive rational weights:

   ```txt
   w_energy > 0
   w_tracer > 0
   w_energy + w_tracer = 1
   ```

   These weights are fixed once for the chosen encoding and are not tuned after examining data or outcomes.

2. Basin and region aggregation

   Given finite libraries `L_region`, `L_basin`, and `L_tracer` that are also part of `e`, we define the aggregated mismatches:

   ```txt
   E_mis(m) = max over R_k in L_region of DeltaS_energy(m; R_k)

   T_mis(m) = max over (B_j, tracer_type) in L_basin x L_tracer
              of DeltaS_tracer(m; B_j, tracer_type)
   ```

   The maxima are taken over finite sets, so they are well defined for all states where each mismatch is finite.

3. Global mixing tension

   The global mixing tension functional is:

   ```txt
   Tension_mix(m) = w_energy * E_mis(m) + w_tracer * T_mis(m)
   ```

   Properties:

   * `Tension_mix(m) >= 0` for all states in the regular domain.
   * `Tension_mix(m)` is small when both energy and tracer mismatches are small.
   * `Tension_mix(m)` grows when mismatches in either sector grow.

   For later reuse, we also view `Tension_mix(m)` as the canonical scalar tension for this node and write

   ```txt
   DeltaS_ocean_mix(m) = Tension_mix(m)
   ```

   at the effective layer.

### 3.4 Singular set and domain restriction

Some states represent incomplete or inconsistent descriptions where mismatch observables are not finite. To handle this, we define the problem specific singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M_ocean :
           exists R_k or B_j or tracer_type
           such that DeltaS_energy(m; R_k) or
                    DeltaS_tracer(m; B_j, tracer_type)
           is undefined or not finite }
```

We then restrict attention to the regular domain:

```txt
M_ocean_reg = M_ocean \ S_sing
```

Rules:

* All evaluations of `E_mis`, `T_mis`, `Tension_mix`, and `DeltaS_ocean_mix` are only defined on `M_ocean_reg`.
* When an experiment encounters a state in `S_sing`, the outcome is labelled “out of domain” rather than being treated as evidence about deep mixing physics.
* Any encoding or dataset that systematically produces states in `S_sing` for otherwise well observed periods is considered misaligned or invalid for Q094 purposes.

This explicit domain restriction prevents divergent or incomplete configurations from being mistaken for genuine high tension states.

### 3.5 Admissible encoding class A_enc(Q094)

The admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q094)` is a finite set of encoding elements. Each element

```txt
e in A_enc(Q094)
```

consists of:

1. A finite library of regions and basins:

   ```txt
   L_region(e) = { R_1, ..., R_N }
   L_basin(e)  = { B_1, ..., B_M }
   ```

2. A finite library of tracer labels:

   ```txt
   L_tracer(e) = { tracer_1, ..., tracer_K }
   ```

   where tracer labels include at least “heat” and “carbon”.

3. A rational weight pair:

   ```txt
   (w_energy(e), w_tracer(e))
   ```

   with `w_energy(e) > 0`, `w_tracer(e) > 0`, `w_energy(e) + w_tracer(e) = 1`.

4. Threshold tables:

   ```txt
   (epsilon_energy(e), epsilon_tracer(e), epsilon_mix(e))
   (delta_energy(e),   delta_tracer(e),   delta_mix(e))
   ```

   with `epsilon_* >= 0` and `delta_* > 0`. These thresholds define low tension and high tension bands for Sections 4 and 5.

5. A specification of:

   * which datasets or model families are in scope,
   * which time windows are used for constructing states in `M_ocean`.

For this page, the header field

```txt
Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1
```

selects a particular element

```txt
e* in A_enc(Q094)
```

that fixes:

* `L_region = L_region(e*)`,
* `L_basin = L_basin(e*)`,
* `L_tracer = L_tracer(e*)`,
* `w_energy = w_energy(e*)`,
* `w_tracer = w_tracer(e*)`,
* thresholds `epsilon_*`, `delta_*` as in `e*`.

All references to weights and thresholds in Sections 4, 5, and 6 are taken from this selected element and are not tuned after looking at experiment outcomes.

### 3.6 Invariants

For later use and for cross problem transfer, we treat the aggregated mismatches as invariants:

```txt
I_energy(m) = E_mis(m)
I_tracer(m) = T_mis(m)
```

The global mixing tension is then

```txt
Tension_mix(m) =
    w_energy * I_energy(m)
  + w_tracer * I_tracer(m)
  = DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)
```

on the regular domain `M_ocean_reg`.

### 3.7 Effective tension tensor components

At the effective layer, we embed Q094 into the generic TU tension tensor template. We introduce a semantic tension tensor `T_ij` on `M_ocean_reg` of the form:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_ocean_mix(m) * lambda_state(m) * kappa_ocean
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` are source like factors that represent how strongly the i-th component of the system injects ocean related stress into the configuration, for example particular basins, mixing hotspots, or forcing sectors.
* `C_j(m)` are receptivity like factors that represent how sensitive the j-th component is to changes in deep mixing and overturning, for example surface climate metrics or coupled subsystems that depend on ocean heat uptake.
* `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)` is the scalar mixing tension defined above.
* `lambda_state(m)` is a convergence state factor that encodes whether the configuration is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic under small perturbations.
* `kappa_ocean` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of ocean related thermodynamic_tension and is fixed as part of the encoding element `e*`.

The explicit index sets for `i` and `j` are not required in this entry. It is sufficient that `T_ij(m)` is finite for all relevant indices in the regular domain and that it scales linearly with `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)` when other factors are held fixed.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q094 is characterised as a tension problem within TU under the encoding element `e*` selected by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1`.

### 4.1 Core tension principle

The core principle for Q094 can be stated as:

> Deep ocean mixing and large scale overturning circulation should form configurations for which the combined energy and tracer budget mismatches, summarised by the scalar tension `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)`, can be kept within a low and stable band across regions, basins, and tracers, when the configuration is consistent with physical constraints and observations.

Using the thresholds from `e*`, this becomes:

* Low tension configurations:

  * For many states `m_T` in `M_ocean_reg` that represent physically plausible and well constrained worlds, we have

    ```txt
    I_energy(m_T)  <= epsilon_energy(e*)
    I_tracer(m_T)  <= epsilon_tracer(e*)
    DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_T) <= epsilon_mix(e*)
    ```

    with thresholds inherited from the encoding element `e*`.

* High tension configurations:

  * For states `m_F` that attempt to represent the actual world but rely on inconsistent or unphysical mixing and overturning patterns, there exist thresholds from `e*` such that

    ```txt
    I_energy(m_F)  >= delta_energy(e*)
    or
    I_tracer(m_F)  >= delta_tracer(e*)
    ```

    and

    ```txt
    DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_F) >= delta_mix(e*)
    ```

  * These inequalities persist under refinements of data and parameterisations that stay within the admissible ranges encoded in `e*`.

Thresholds in this section are not free tuning knobs. They are part of the finite encoding element selected by `Encoding_key` and remain fixed throughout all experiments that claim to use `TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1`.

### 4.2 Role of constraints

The tension principle incorporates three kinds of constraints:

1. Energetic constraints:

   * Available mechanical energy from winds and tides is limited.
   * Diapycnal mixing must not exceed what this energy can plausibly support without violating energy conservation.

2. Stratification constraints:

   * Observed stratification profiles limit how much mixing can occur without destroying density structure and overturning the water column in ways that conflict with observations.

3. Tracer constraints:

   * Observed distributions of heat and carbon in the deep ocean restrict allowable combinations of mixing and overturning.
     Configurations that imply incompatible tracer patterns produce large `DeltaS_tracer` values.

The Q094 tension principle requires that any proposed configuration must respect all three constraint types at the same time in order to qualify as a low tension solution.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds that differ only in their effective deep mixing and circulation patterns. We stay at the effective layer and do not describe how internal fields are constructed from data.

All inequalities below use the thresholds that belong to the encoding element `e*` selected by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1`.

### 5.1 World T (well behaved deep mixing and circulation)

World T represents a class of worlds where deep mixing and circulation are physically consistent and observationally plausible.

Characteristics:

1. Energy budget closure

   * For world representing states `m_T` in `M_ocean_reg`, the energy mismatch satisfies

     ```txt
     I_energy(m_T) = E_mis(m_T) <= epsilon_energy(e*)
     ```

     where `epsilon_energy(e*)` reflects measurement and model uncertainties for the chosen encoding.

2. Tracer budget closure

   * For heat and carbon tracers in all basins, the tracer mismatch satisfies

     ```txt
     I_tracer(m_T) = T_mis(m_T) <= epsilon_tracer(e*)
     ```

     where `epsilon_tracer(e*)` is consistent with known observational errors and model limitations.

3. Stable global mixing tension

   * The global mixing tension satisfies

     ```txt
     DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_T) <= epsilon_mix(e*)
     ```

     for a small `epsilon_mix(e*)`, and this bound remains of the same order when the library of regions and basins is refined and when more precise data are added, as long as changes remain inside the scope of `e*`.

4. Physical plausibility

   * Mixing coefficients `K_mix(m_T; R_k, z_bin)` remain within ranges that can be supported by known sources of mechanical energy and turbulence.
   * Overturning circulation summaries `Psi_overturn(m_T; B_j, depth_bin)` are consistent with large scale observational constraints such as overturning transports and water mass distributions.

### 5.2 World F (pathological or mis specified deep mixing)

World F represents a class of worlds where deep mixing and overturning are mis specified in a way that cannot satisfy constraints.

Characteristics:

1. Energy budget failure

   * For some world representing states `m_F` in `M_ocean_reg`, there exist regions `R_k` where

     ```txt
     DeltaS_energy(m_F; R_k) >= delta_energy(e*)
     ```

     with `delta_energy(e*)` strictly larger than credible tolerance levels derived from observations and theory.

2. Tracer inconsistency

   * For some basins and tracers, the mismatch satisfies

     ```txt
     DeltaS_tracer(m_F; B_j, tracer_type) >= delta_tracer(e*)
     ```

     where `delta_tracer(e*)` is too large to be explained by observational and modelling uncertainty.

3. Persistent high tension

   * For world representing states `m_F`, the global tension satisfies

     ```txt
     DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_F) >= delta_mix(e*)
     ```

     with `delta_mix(e*) > 0` that cannot be removed by refining the region and basin library or by incorporating additional physically consistent data within the encoding element `e*`.

4. Implausible parameter regimes

   * Some mixing coefficients or overturning patterns require energy sources that are not available, or would destroy observed stratification if realised.
     Such regimes are classified as high tension and are rejected for engineering use even if they fit some subsets of data.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

World T and World F are not claims about the actual Earth. They are effective layer constructions on `M_ocean_reg` that express:

* how deep ocean mixing and circulation could behave in a low tension regime,
* how they would behave in a high tension regime that conflicts with constraints.

Q094 does not decide which class the real Earth belongs to. It provides a structured way to:

* encode these counterfactual regimes,
* test how different encodings in `A_enc(Q094)` classify them,
* and measure how strongly available evidence favours one regime over the other under a given encoding.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that:

* test the coherence of the Q094 encoding,
* distinguish between different deep mixing models,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter choices at the effective layer.

Unless otherwise stated, all experiments in this section are defined under the encoding element

```txt
e* in A_enc(Q094)
```

selected by

```txt
Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1
```

with weights, libraries, and thresholds as described in Section 3.5.

These experiments can falsify Q094 related encodings at the effective layer. They do not solve the canonical problem in Section 1 and do not refute any proposed TU core.

### Experiment 1: Energy budget consistency under mixing profiles

*Goal:*
Test whether a given family of deep mixing and overturning encodings is consistent with regional and global energy budgets under the chosen encoding element `e*`.

*Setup:*

* Input data:

  * output from an ocean or climate model with several prescribed mixing parameter sets,
  * external estimates of mechanical energy input to the deep ocean in each region,
  * estimates of observed stratification.

* For each parameter set, an external procedure constructs a state `m_param` in `M_ocean` that encodes:

  * `K_mix(m_param; R_k, z_bin)`,
  * `Psi_overturn(m_param; B_j, depth_bin)`,
  * derived energy budget summaries consistent with the metadata.

*Protocol:*

1. For each parameter set, check whether `m_param` lies in `M_ocean_reg`.
   If not, flag as out of domain and exclude from tension analysis.
2. For each `m_param` in `M_ocean_reg`, compute `DeltaS_energy(m_param; R_k)` for all regions `R_k` in `L_region(e*)`.
3. Compute

   ```txt
   I_energy(m_param) = E_mis(m_param)
   DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_param)
   ```

   using weights from `e*`. If tracer related components are not in scope for this experiment, they are held fixed or set to zero as documented in the experiment design.
4. Record the distribution of `I_energy(m_param)` and `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_param)` across parameter sets and regions.
5. Compare the tension values against the low tension band derived from `epsilon_energy(e*)` and `epsilon_mix(e*)`.

*Metrics:*

* Fraction of parameter sets for which

  ```txt
  I_energy(m_param)        <= epsilon_energy(e*)
  DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_param) <= epsilon_mix(e*)
  ```

  both hold.

* Maximum and median values of `I_energy(m_param)` across regions.

* Sensitivity of tension values to small changes in mixing parameters that stay within physically motivated ranges.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If, for all parameter sets that obey basic physical constraints on mixing strength and energy input, the observed `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_param)` systematically exceeds the low tension band defined by `epsilon_mix(e*)`, then the combination of

  * `DeltaS_energy`,
  * the region library,
  * the chosen weights and thresholds in `e*`

  is considered falsified as an encoding element in `A_enc(Q094)`.

* If small, physically insignificant changes in mixing parameters produce large and erratic swings in `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_param)` without clear physical reasons, the encoding element `e*` is considered unstable and rejected for Q094 purposes.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All quantities are represented as continuous fields on coarse regions and depth bins. The evaluation of mismatch and tension uses finite sums and maxima, consistent with the continuous field interpretation in the metadata.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying `e*` or a subfamily of encodings does not solve the canonical problem and does not imply any failure of a TU core. It only shows that this particular effective encoding does not provide a stable, physically coherent description of deep ocean energy budgets.

### Experiment 2: Tracer inversion consistency

*Goal:*
Assess whether combining `K_mix` and `Psi_overturn` under `e*` can reproduce deep tracer distributions within realistic error bounds, while remaining compatible with energy constraints from Experiment 1.

*Setup:*

* Input data:

  * observed or externally specified deep tracer distributions for heat and carbon in each basin,
  * a family of mixing and overturning parameterisations that yield states `m_trial` in `M_ocean`.

* A forward model maps each state `m_trial` to predicted tracer fields.
  This forward model is external to TU and is not described in this entry.

*Protocol:*

1. For each `m_trial`, verify membership in `M_ocean_reg`. If not, mark as out of domain.
2. For each basin and tracer label in `L_tracer(e*)`, compute

   ```txt
   DeltaS_tracer(m_trial; B_j, tracer_type)
   ```

   by comparing predicted and observed tracer summaries.
3. Compute

   ```txt
   I_tracer(m_trial)      = T_mis(m_trial)
   DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_trial)
   ```

   using the weights specified in `e*`.
4. Analyse how `I_tracer(m_trial)` and `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m_trial)` change across the family of parameterisations, and cross reference with the energy based results from Experiment 1 for the same parameter sets where available.

*Metrics:*

* Basin wise distributions of tracer mismatches.
* Global tracer mismatch measure `I_tracer(m_trial)` for each state.
* Tradeoff between fitting tracer data and preserving energy budget consistency, using `I_energy` and `DeltaS_ocean_mix` from Experiment 1.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If, under any physically plausible combination of mixing and overturning parameterisations inside the scope of `e*`, `I_tracer(m_trial)` cannot be reduced below `epsilon_tracer(e*)` for a substantial set of basins, the current definition of `DeltaS_tracer` or the region and basin selection in `e*` is considered falsified and must be revised as a new encoding element in `A_enc(Q094)`.
* If parameterisations that produce acceptable tracer fits require mixing patterns that violate energy constraints established in Experiment 1, the joint encoding of energy and tracer tension in `e*` is considered misaligned and should not be used as a reference encoding.

*Semantics implementation note:*
Tracer fields and mismatches are represented as continuous field summaries aggregated over finite regions and basins. All operations use finite sums and differences, consistent with the continuous field interpretation.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying an encoding or subfamily in `A_enc(Q094)` through this experiment does not determine the unique true configuration of the deep ocean. It only sharpens which combinations of mixing and overturning are acceptable at the effective layer for TU purposes.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q094 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework. All signals and modules in this section operate purely at the effective layer using the quantities defined in Section 3.

### 7.1 Training signals

We introduce training signals that use Q094 tension quantities in AI models.

1. `signal_mixing_energy_balance`

   * Definition: a penalty signal proportional to `I_energy(m)` for states inferred from climate related prompts or internal representations.
   * Purpose: discourage internal configurations that imply large unclosed energy mismatches in deep ocean regions.

2. `signal_tracer_pathway_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `I_tracer(m)` when the model reasons about deep heat or carbon storage patterns.
   * Purpose: penalise internal states that combine mixing and overturning in ways that are inconsistent with expected tracer distributions.

3. `signal_ocean_tension_score`

   * Definition: a scalar supervision target equal to `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)` for constructed states in training scenarios.
   * Purpose: provide a simple tension metric that can be minimised in tasks where physically plausible deep ocean behaviour is desired.

4. `signal_scenario_contrast`

   * Definition: a signal that measures relative tension between alternative policy or forcing scenarios `m_1` and `m_2` constructed from different climate narratives.
   * Purpose: help the model compare the physical plausibility and risk profile of different scenario descriptions.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline patterns that can reuse Q094 structures without exposing any TU core or generative rules.

1. `OceanTensionHead`

   * Role: takes internal embeddings representing deep ocean or climate states and outputs an estimate of `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)` and a decomposition into energy and tracer parts.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embedding vector summarising ocean relevant context.
     * Output: scalar tension estimate and a small vector `[I_energy_estimate, I_tracer_estimate]`.

2. `VerticalProfileEncoder`

   * Role: converts textual or numerical descriptions of stratification and mixing into a compact representation compatible with the state space `M_ocean`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: profile descriptions for a region or basin.
     * Output: encoded features that can be fed into the OceanTensionHead.

3. `ScenarioComparator`

   * Role: given two scenario representations, estimates differential tension and highlights which aspects of mixing and circulation drive the difference.
   * Interface:

     * Input: two internal state representations `m_1`, `m_2`.
     * Output: difference in estimated tension and an explanation vector tying it to energy and tracer mismatches.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A simple evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q094 modules:

1. Task selection

   * Select tasks where the model must reason about:

     * deep ocean heat uptake,
     * long term carbon storage in the ocean,
     * overturning circulation responses to forcing.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * model operates without explicit Q094 tension modules.

   * Q094 condition:

     * model uses OceanTensionHead, VerticalProfileEncoder, and related signals during training or inference.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on questions that require correctly ranking or explaining different mixing and overturning scenarios.
   * Consistency between qualitative narratives and implied energy and tracer budget closure.
   * Robustness under small perturbations of the prompt or input data.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the impact of Q094 encoding in an AI system:

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain how deep ocean mixing and overturning affect long term climate, including heat and carbon storage, without any reference to tension or explicit budgets.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation is vague, internally inconsistent, or missing key constraints.

* Q094 encoded setup:

  * Prompt: ask the same question but require the explanation to:

    * explicitly mention closure of energy and tracer budgets,
    * describe the role of mixing coefficients and overturning patterns,
    * indicate how inconsistent configurations would manifest as high tension.

  * Observation: record whether the explanation becomes more structured and constraint aware.

* Comparison metric:

  * Human or expert judges score the two explanations on:

    * clarity of the budget closure story,
    * consistency with known physical constraints,
    * explicit recognition of deep ocean time scales.

* What to log:

  * the prompts, responses, and any tension estimates produced by Q094 modules.
    This enables later inspection and comparison without exposing any TU core mechanism.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q094 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `DeepMixingTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `mixing_profiles`, `overturning_summaries`, `budget_constraints`.
     * Output: `tension_value` as a nonnegative scalar indicating consistency of deep mixing and circulation with energy and tracer budgets, interpreted as `DeltaS_ocean_mix`.

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs describe coherent summaries on the finite region and basin library.
     * Basic physical constraints on energy availability are already enforced.

2. ComponentName: `OceanColumnStateField`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `location`, `depth_range`.
     * Output: descriptors of stratification, mixing, and storage suitable for climate scale reasoning.

   * Preconditions:

     * Location and depth range belong to defined regions and depth bins.
     * Observational or model based summaries exist for those elements.

3. ComponentName: `MixingScenarioComparator`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: two sets of deep mixing and overturning summaries.
     * Output: comparative report containing:

       * estimated tension for each scenario,
       * sectors where energy or tracer budgets are most stressed.

   * Preconditions:

     * Both scenarios use the same region and basin library and the same budget constraints.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Target: Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)

   * Reused component: `DeepMixingTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: Q091 needs to connect surface forcing and global energy balance to deep ocean heat uptake patterns. The functional constrains how much energy can be stored in the deep ocean without violating budgets.
   * What changes: the focus shifts to time integrated heat uptake and its role in the global sensitivity parameter.

2. Target: Q093 (BH_EARTH_CARBON_CYCLE_L3_093)

   * Reused component: `OceanColumnStateField`.
   * Why it transfers: long term carbon storage and release depend on how carbon is sequestered in and returned from deep ocean layers.
   * What changes: tracers of interest include dissolved inorganic carbon and related chemical variables in addition to heat.

3. Target: Q099 (BH_EARTH_WATER_STRESS_L3_099)

   * Reused components: `OceanColumnStateField` and `MixingScenarioComparator`.
   * Why it transfers: freshwater anomalies travel through and are stored in deep ocean structures shaped by mixing and overturning.
   * What changes: tracers include salinity and freshwater content, and the comparator highlights regions where anomalies are likely to persist or resurface.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q094 is positioned on the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding of deep ocean mixing and circulation has been specified.
  * Tension observables and a combined scalar tension functional `DeltaS_ocean_mix` have been defined, with explicit weights and finite libraries as part of `A_enc(Q094)`.
  * At least two discriminating experiments with clear falsification conditions have been described.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connects small scale mixing, large scale overturning, and global budget closure in a single framework.
  * Counterfactual low tension and high tension worlds have been outlined at the effective layer.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2 under the encoding element `e*`, at least one of the following concrete steps should be achieved:

1. Implement a prototype tool that:

   * takes model based deep mixing and overturning summaries as input,
   * constructs states in `M_ocean_reg`,
   * computes `DeltaS_ocean_mix(m)` for a set of standard climate scenarios,
   * publishes the resulting tension profiles and thresholds for external scrutiny.

2. Carry out an initial application of Experiments 1 and 2 on:

   * a limited set of climate model outputs and observations,
   * with fully specified region and basin libraries from `e*`,
   * and report whether the resulting tension values fall in plausible ranges relative to `epsilon_*` and `delta_*`.

These steps remain entirely within the effective layer. They do not require exposing any TU core or generative mechanism.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q094 is expected to serve as:

* the central Earth system node for thermodynamic_tension in the ocean, connecting mixing, circulation, and climate time scales,
* a template for how to treat under observed yet structurally constrained systems where closure of budgets is the main organising principle,
* a bridge between climate physics, biogeochemistry, and risk analysis nodes that depend on slow but powerful deep ocean processes.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides a non expert explanation that stays aligned with the effective layer description.

The deep ocean is a huge, cold, and dark reservoir that stores heat, carbon, and other tracers for very long times. Small scale turbulence and waves mix water up and down, while large scale currents slowly move water masses between regions and between the surface and the deep.

Scientists know that:

* only a limited amount of energy is available to stir the deep ocean,
* mixing cannot be too strong or it would erase the observed layering,
* mixing cannot be too weak or it would fail to explain how heat and carbon reach the deep ocean.

At the same time, we can measure how much heat and carbon end up stored in the deep ocean over decades and centuries. The difficult part is to find descriptions of mixing and circulation that:

* respect energy limits,
* preserve stratification,
* match the observed patterns of heat and carbon.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to write down every fluid motion. Instead we ask:

* For a given summary of mixing and circulation, how badly do the energy and tracer budgets fail to close?
* Can we assign a number, the mixing tension `DeltaS_ocean_mix`, that is small when the budgets nearly close and large when they do not?

We imagine a space of possible deep ocean configurations. Each configuration records:

* how strong mixing is in different regions and depths,
* how strong large scale currents are,
* how much energy and tracer mismatch appears in each region.

From this information we calculate a mixing tension. Then we compare two types of worlds:

* In a low tension world, we can choose mixing and currents so that:

  * energy input, storage, and dissipation nearly balance,
  * heat and carbon distributions are reproduced within reasonable error bars.

* In a high tension world, any attempt to match the data either:

  * violates energy limits, or
  * produces tracer patterns that do not look like the real ocean.

This does not tell us the exact true state of the deep ocean. It does not solve the full fluid dynamics. However, it gives us:

* a way to say when a proposed mixing and circulation picture is physically and observationally coherent,
* a way to test and reject encodings that are inconsistent,
* reusable tools for AI systems that need to reason about deep ocean behaviour inside the wider climate and Earth system.

Q094 is the node that organises all of this inside the Tension Universe. It turns the question “how does the deep ocean really mix and circulate?” into a precise problem about closing budgets and controlling tension across time scales.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S problem collection. It specifies an effective layer encoding of the deep ocean mixing and circulation problem and a finite admissible encoding class `A_enc(Q094)` for this node.

Scope of claims:

* This document does not claim to solve the canonical physical problem in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that any open problem in physical oceanography, climate science, or TU foundations has been solved.
* All constructions and experiments here operate on coarse grained summaries and tension quantities at the effective layer.

Encoding and thresholds:

* The header field `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q094_OCEAN_v1` selects a single encoding element in `A_enc(Q094)` that fixes libraries, weights, and thresholds.
* Changing these choices beyond documented uncertainty ranges requires a new encoding key and produces a new encoding element.
* Falsification of one encoding element or subfamily does not refute a TU core and does not solve any canonical S problem.

Relationship to other charters:

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

These charters define global rules for effective layer boundaries, encoding families, and tension scales that apply across the entire Tension Universe collection, including Q094.
