AI NOTE · ADOPTERS

Purpose:
- This page is the short public adoption summary for WFGY.
- It is meant for evaluators, collaborators, and first-time visitors who want the strongest public evidence first.
- This page is intentionally shorter than the full recognition log.

How to read this page:
- The entries below are the strongest current public examples of WFGY adoption, integration, or research-facing reuse.
- Most public adoption today points to the WFGY ProblemMap / 16-problem failure checklist line.
- For the full and continuously maintained ecosystem record, go to recognition/README.md.

Important boundary:
- This is not a customer logo page.
- This does not claim that every listed project uses the full WFGY ecosystem.
- This page is a short summary layer, not the canonical source-of-truth ledger.

# ADOPTERS

Short public adoption summary for WFGY.

This page highlights the **strongest current public examples** of where WFGY has already been integrated, adapted, cited, or wrapped in the open ecosystem.

It is **not** a customer list, **not** an enterprise logo page, and **not** a claim that every listed project uses the full WFGY ecosystem.

At the current stage, the clearest public adoption is concentrated around the **WFGY ProblemMap / 16-problem failure checklist** line.

For the full and continuously maintained recognition log, see:

- [WFGY Recognition Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/recognition/README.md)

## Strongest current public adoption examples

These are the strongest public examples because they involve one or more of the following:

- merged documentation integrations
- direct tool wrapping
- official troubleshooting references
- research-facing citation or adaptation
- structured reuse of the WFGY ProblemMap

## What this page means

The safest reading is:

- WFGY already has real public ecosystem traction
- the strongest traction today is around the **ProblemMap** line
- WFGY is most visible as a **diagnostic and debugging layer** for RAG and agent systems
- this is stronger than a purely theoretical project, but should **not** be exaggerated into full enterprise-adoption claims

## What this page does not claim

This page does not claim that:

- every listed project is a paid customer
- every listed project uses the full WFGY ecosystem
- every listed project has deployed WFGY in production
- every public reference implies endorsement of all WFGY directions

This page is intentionally narrow: it shows the strongest public adoption evidence first.
