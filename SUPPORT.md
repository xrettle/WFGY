# 🛠 Why support this project?

Developing and maintaining WFGY requires:

- Continuous refinement of the core reasoning architecture  
- Maintaining documentation and integration examples  
- Running structured experiments and stress tests  
- Iterating based on real-world user feedback  
- Keeping the framework open and MIT-licensed  

This is long-term engineering work.

A donation is not a purchase of features.
It is support for sustained independent development.

# 📩 After you donate

If you would like:

- Confirmation that funds were received  
- To be acknowledged as a supporter  
- To share feedback or suggest focus areas  

Please email:

📧 **donate@onestardao.com**

You may include:

- Transaction hash  
- Network used (BTC / TRON / ERC20 / BEP20)

# 🤝 Thank you

Open technical systems survive only when they are genuinely useful.

Whether you donate, share, test, or contribute feedback, your involvement helps ensure that WFGY remains an independent and evolving framework.

Thank you for supporting open structural research.
