# 🚀 WFGY 3.0 · RAG 16 Problem Map  
## 🌐 Global Debug Card

The full RAG failure system compressed into one portable image.

Feed a failing run (Q, E, P, A) plus this card to any LLM.  
The model can classify ΔS zones, detect failure type (R / P / S / I), choose modes (1–16), and propose structural fixes.

No external framework required.

RAG ΔS CLINIC · GLOBAL DEBUG CARD

OBJECTS
Q = user question
E = top-k retrieved docs (small k, e.g., 3–5), concatenated with a consistent separator
P = final user-side prompt string sent to model (template wrapping Q + E)
A = model answer

EMBEDDING + METRIC
I(X) = embedding of text X from one fixed model checkpoint
cos_sim(u,v) = cosine similarity in [0,1]
ΔS(X,Y) = 1 − cos_sim(I(X), I(Y))        // hence 0 ≤ ΔS ≤ 1

BOUNDARY SCORES
ΔS_QE = ΔS(Q,E)
ΔS_EP = ΔS(E,P)
ΔS_PA = ΔS(P,A)
ΔS_QA = ΔS(Q,A)

ZONES
safe:    0.00 ≤ ΔS < 0.40
transit: 0.40 ≤ ΔS < 0.60
risk:    0.60 ≤ ΔS < 0.85
danger:  0.85 ≤ ΔS ≤ 1.00

zone(ΔS) ∈ {safe, transit, risk, danger}
zone_order: safe < transit < risk < danger
“X is not worse than Y” means zone_order(X) ≤ zone_order(Y).

LANES
IN = input / retrieval
RE = reasoning / planning
ST = state / context
OP = infra / deploy

PATTERNS → TYPE → FIX FOCUS

If several types match, prefer I > S > R > P.

Let Z_QE = zone(ΔS_QE), Z_EP = zone(ΔS_EP),
    Z_PA = zone(ΔS_PA), Z_QA = zone(ΔS_QA).

Type R (retrieval)
Cond:
( Z_QE ∈ {risk,danger} and Z_QA ∈ {risk,danger}
  and Z_EP, Z_PA are not worse than Z_QE )
or
( Z_QE = safe and Z_EP ∈ {safe,transit} and Z_QA ∈ {risk,danger} )

Typical modes: {1,5,8}

Type P (prompt / reasoning)
Cond:
Z_QE, Z_EP ∈ {safe,transit} and Z_PA, Z_QA ∈ {risk,danger}

Typical modes: {2,3,4,6,10,11,12}

Type S (state / memory)
Multi-run:
Z_QE stable, Z_QA changes zones.

Single-run heuristic:
matches modes {7,9,13}.

Typical modes: {7,9,13}

Type I (infra)
Cond:
E empty, placeholder, mismatching Q,
or inconsistent/unobservable across runs.

If Type I holds:
ΔS unreliable; treat ΔS_QE as 1.0 by convention.

Typical modes: {14,15,16,8}

LLM TASK

Given Q, E, P, A:

1. Compute or estimate ΔS_QE, ΔS_EP, ΔS_PA, ΔS_QA.
2. Assign zones.
3. Choose type ∈ {R,P,S,I}.
4. Choose 1–3 modes.
5. Propose structural fixes.
6. Define 1 verification test per fix.
