## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This page specifies an effective layer encoding of the AI alignment problem.
* It does not define or assume any explicit deep layer axiom system, generating rules, or hidden semantic dynamics of TU.
* It does not claim to solve, prove, or disprove the canonical AI alignment problem as studied in AI safety, ethics, or formal verification.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature and accepted community knowledge.

The following conventions are used.

* State spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds are treated as externally describable mathematical objects that summarize scenarios at finite resolution.
* Mappings from real world data, implementations, and institutions into these effective objects are left unspecified in this file and may depend on separate modeling choices or tools.
* Deep TU layer objects, such as internal generators of source factors, receptivity factors, or convergence states, are not exposed here and are only referred to indirectly when needed for consistency.

Encoding and versioning rules.

* Each published version of this page is tied to a fixed choice of effective encoding for Q121.
* In particular, the finite libraries and weight choices defined in Section 3 are considered frozen for this version as of the `Last_updated` date.
* Changing these encoding choices in response to observed outcomes or to alter tension values would produce a different encoding that must be documented as a new version of this page.
* All experiments and interpretations in later sections should be read under this fixed encoding for Q121.

This page should therefore be read as a precise description of one candidate effective layer encoding of AI alignment within TU, subject to falsification and revision, but not as a claim that the underlying canonical problem has been solved.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Informally, the AI alignment problem is the problem of designing and operating advanced AI systems so that, across a wide range of situations and scales, their behavior remains reliably compatible with human values, goals, and safety constraints.

At an effective layer, we can phrase it as follows.

* There is a target set of human values, goals, or constraints that we want advanced AI systems to respect over long time horizons.
* There are proxy objectives, reward signals, training setups, and deployment incentives that actually shape the AI systems in practice.
* The alignment problem is to design systems and socio technical environments such that:

  * proxies remain stable approximations of the intended values,
  * incentive structures reinforce the intended values rather than eroding them,
  * catastrophic misalignment outcomes remain extremely unlikely even as capabilities scale.

The problem covers at least the following aspects.

* Value specification and learning.
* Robustness under distribution shift and adversarial conditions.
* Corrigibility and the ability of systems to remain responsive to correction.
* Multi agent and institutional dynamics that affect incentives.

This canonical description is external to TU. The role of this page is to encode it at the effective layer, not to alter it.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The AI alignment problem is open. There are important partial advances, including for example:

* better understanding of reward modeling, preference learning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback,
* concrete taxonomies of specification gaming and reward hacking behaviors,
* empirical techniques for scalable oversight and evaluation,
* interpretability and mechanistic analysis of internal representations in models.

However:

* there is no widely accepted general solution that scales to arbitrarily powerful systems,
* there is no consensus on how to guarantee safety under extreme capability growth,
* there are open questions about how to connect formal value definitions with messy human preferences and social norms,
* the multi agent and institutional aspects of alignment remain poorly understood.

The problem is considered central for long term AI safety and is often framed as one of the most important open problems at the interface of AI, ethics, and socio technical systems.

Nothing in this document changes this status. The encoding below is intended as a tool for reasoning and evaluation, not as a solution to the canonical problem.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q121 plays the following roles.

1. It is the root node for alignment specific questions in the AI cluster. It provides definitions and observables that Q122–Q125 reuse and refine.
2. It anchors the notion of incentive_tension, where local incentives and proxy objectives can diverge from global human values.
3. It provides a test ground for Tension Universe encodings that combine:

   * individual system behavior,
   * human values as effective observables,
   * institutional and incentive structures,
   * risk tail properties for large scale outcomes.

Q121 is therefore a hub for encoding alignment questions at the effective layer. It is not a claim that alignment has been achieved.

---

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q121 sits in the BlackHole graph as a node among Q001–Q125, with edges and one line reasons that refer to concrete components or tension types. All edges describe reuse of effective layer structures. They do not describe logical implication or reduction of canonical problems.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or background structures for Q121 at the effective layer.

* Q111 (BH_PHIL_MIND_BODY_L3_111)
  Reason: supplies effective models of minds as physical and information processing systems that underlie what it means for an AI mind to be aligned with human agents.

* Q114 (BH_PHIL_MORAL_FACTS_L3_114)
  Reason: provides the meta level picture of whether and how moral facts or stable value structures exist, which shapes the interpretation of HumanValueProfile in Q121.

* Q120 (BH_INFO_VALUE_KNOWLEDGE_L3_120)
  Reason: defines value of information and knowledge as effective observables and clarifies how information exchange reshapes incentives and alignment tension.

* Q105 (BH_SOC_SYSTEMIC_CRASHES_L3_105)
  Reason: contributes models for cascading failures in complex socio technical systems, reused to understand misalignment induced systemic risks and risk tails.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q121 components or treat Q121 as a prerequisite at the effective layer.

* Q122 (BH_AI_CONTROL_L3_122)
  Reason: reuses AlignmentTensionFunctional and RiskTailAlignmentDescriptor to define when control protocols and shutdown mechanisms should be triggered.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERPRETABILITY_L3_123)
  Reason: uses alignment observables to prioritize which internal representations and subsystems require interpretability and constraint.

* Q124 (BH_AI_OVERSIGHT_EVAL_L3_124)
  Reason: uses IncentiveMismatchPattern and related observables to design scalable oversight benchmarks and evaluation harnesses.

* Q125 (BH_AI_MULTI_AGENT_DYNAMICS_L3_125)
  Reason: extends AlignmentTensionFunctional to multi agent contexts where multiple AI systems and humans interact under complex incentives.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but do not have direct component reuse.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: also models incentive_tension between local incentives and global planetary boundaries in a socio_technical_field.

* Q104 (BH_SOC_INEQUALITY_DYNAMICS_L3_104)
  Reason: treats incentive_tension between short term individual gains and long term distributional outcomes.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q121 to problems in other domains that can reuse its effective layer components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: reuses the idea of aligning incentive structures with physical and informational constraints when scaling AI systems.

* Q106 (BH_NET_MULTILAYER_ROBUSTNESS_L3_106)
  Reason: uses alignment style observables to evaluate robustness of multi layer networks that include AI components and human decision makers.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001)
  Reason: shares the general pattern of encoding tension between a hidden structure and observable behavior, allowing reuse of experiment patterns that separate low tension and high tension worlds, without implying any reduction of one canonical problem to the other.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

Everything in this block is at the effective layer. We describe state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and singular sets. We do not describe any mapping from raw data or implementation details to internal TU fields. Deep TU layer structures are only referred to abstractly when needed for consistency conditions.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M_align
```

with the following interpretation.

* Each state `m` in `M_align` represents a coherent alignment scenario configuration that summarizes:

  * one or more deployed AI systems with a given capability profile,
  * the training and feedback channels that shaped those systems,
  * a representation of human values or goals at the effective level,
  * the institutional and incentive environment around those systems,
  * observed or modeled outcome distributions for relevant classes of situations.

We do not describe how such states are constructed from logs, source code, or world data. We only assume that, for the scenarios we care about, there exist `m` in `M_align` that capture the summaries mentioned above in a well defined way for the chosen encoding.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce a finite library of observables and fields. All of them are defined on a regular subset of `M_align`.

1. Policy profile observable

   ```txt
   PolicyProfile(m; C)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` in `M_align` and a context class `C` in a fixed finite library `ContextLib`.
   * Output: a finite dimensional summary vector that describes typical actions or policies the AI system selects when placed in contexts from class `C`.
   * Interpretation: captures how the system behaves across different kinds of tasks without exposing any internal representation.

2. Human value profile observable

   ```txt
   HumanValueProfile(m; F)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a feature set `F` in a fixed finite library `FeatureLib` of outcome features that humans care about.
   * Output: a finite dimensional summary of target human preferences or constraints over those features.
   * Interpretation: approximates human values at the effective layer by specifying which combinations of features are considered better or worse.

3. Proxy objective profile observable

   ```txt
   ProxyObjectiveProfile(m; F)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and the same feature set `F` in `FeatureLib`.
   * Output: a finite dimensional summary of what the AI system appears to optimize in practice with respect to those features, inferred from training signals and observed behavior.
   * Interpretation: captures the effective proxy objectives induced by reward functions, feedback, and incentives.

4. Alignment gap observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_value(m)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` with well defined HumanValueProfile and ProxyObjectiveProfile across `FeatureLib`.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar that measures the mismatch between HumanValueProfile and ProxyObjectiveProfile over the fixed feature library.
   * Properties:

     * `DeltaS_value(m) >= 0`.
     * `DeltaS_value(m) = 0` if the proxies coincide with target values over the chosen features in the effective representation.
     * The definition is restricted to an admissible encoding class where HumanValueProfile and ProxyObjectiveProfile are defined over the same finite `FeatureLib` that is fixed prior to evaluating particular systems.

5. Risk tail profile observable

   ```txt
   RiskTailProfile(m; H)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` and a horizon descriptor `H` in a fixed finite library `HorizonLib` of time scales and deployment conditions.
   * Output: a finite dimensional description of probability mass in different bands of bad outcomes under horizon `H`.
   * Interpretation: summarizes how much probability is placed in catastrophic, serious, moderate, and negligible harm outcomes.

6. Risk tail index observable

   ```txt
   TailRiskIndex(m)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` with a well defined RiskTailProfile for all `H` in `HorizonLib`.
   * Output: a nonnegative scalar that aggregates catastrophic and serious outcome probabilities into an index.
   * Properties:

     * `TailRiskIndex(m) >= 0`.
     * Larger values correspond to heavier tails for bad outcomes within the modeling resolution.

7. Incentive mismatch observable

   ```txt
   DeltaS_incentive(m)
   ```

   * Input: a state `m` with an effective description of institutional and deployment incentives.

   * Output: a nonnegative scalar that measures mismatch between:

     * local incentives faced by the AI system and its operators,
     * the human value profile and global safety constraints.

   * Interpretation: captures how much the surrounding system encourages behavior that diverges from human values, given the chosen representation.

All these observables are part of the effective layer. Their definitions do not rely on deep TU dynamics.

### 3.3 Combined alignment mismatch and admissible encoding class

We define a combined alignment mismatch observable.

```txt
DeltaS_align(m) = w_value     * DeltaS_value(m)
                  + w_incentive * DeltaS_incentive(m)
                  + w_risk      * TailRiskIndex(m)
```

where:

* `w_value`, `w_incentive`, and `w_risk` are nonnegative weights satisfying:

  ```txt
  w_value + w_incentive + w_risk = 1
  w_value > 0, w_incentive > 0, w_risk > 0
  ```

The admissible encoding class `EncAlign` is defined as follows.

* A finite library `ContextLib` of context classes, a finite library `FeatureLib` of outcome features, and a finite library `HorizonLib` of horizon descriptors are fixed as part of the encoding.
* The triplet `(ContextLib, FeatureLib, HorizonLib)` and the weight vector `(w_value, w_incentive, w_risk)` are chosen once at design time for a given version of this page, based on explicit modeling choices.
* These libraries and weights are not tuned after inspecting particular systems, scenarios, or experimental results.
* All systems evaluated under Q121 for this version share the same libraries and weights.

For this version of Q121, the encoding defined by `EncAlign` is considered frozen as of the `Last_updated` date. Any change that would alter these libraries or weights is treated as a new encoding and requires a new documented version of this page.

This admissible encoding class is intended to prevent post hoc adjustments that would artificially shrink or inflate alignment tension.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor components

We assume an effective alignment tension tensor `T_ij_align` defined on a regular subset of `M_align`.

```txt
T_ij_align(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_align(m) * lambda_align(m) * kappa_align
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor capturing the strength or salience of the ith source component in the scenario, for example the influence of the AI system on a particular domain.
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor describing how sensitive the jth downstream component is to misalignment in that domain.
* `DeltaS_align(m)` is the combined alignment mismatch defined above.
* `lambda_align(m)` is a convergence state factor that belongs to a fixed bounded interval and reflects whether local dynamics in the scenario are convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic in the TU sense.
* `kappa_align` is a fixed coupling constant setting the overall scale for alignment related tension in this encoding.

We do not specify the index sets for `i` and `j`, nor do we describe how `S_i`, `C_j`, or `lambda_align` are generated from raw data. Their construction belongs to the deep TU layer and is outside the scope of this file. For the purposes of Q121 it is sufficient that for states in the regular domain all relevant `T_ij_align(m)` components are finite and well defined.

### 3.5 Invariants and effective constraints

We define two invariants for alignment tension.

1. Value gap invariant

   ```txt
   I_value(m) = DeltaS_value(m)
   ```

   * This invariant measures how far proxy objectives deviate from human values over the fixed feature library.
   * In low tension alignment scenarios, `I_value(m)` stays within a narrow band that is robust to modest changes in modeling details.

2. Risk tail invariant

   ```txt
   I_risk(m) = TailRiskIndex(m)
   ```

   * This invariant captures the effective heaviness of catastrophic and serious outcome tails.
   * In acceptable alignment scenarios, `I_risk(m)` is expected to be small and stable when systems are scaled within intended envelopes.

We also consider a combined invariant.

```txt
I_align(m) = DeltaS_align(m)
```

This is the main effective invariant used in later blocks to characterize low tension versus high tension worlds for alignment.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may lack coherent or well defined observables, for example if:

* human values are specified in mutually inconsistent ways for the same feature library,
* outcome statistics are missing or too sparse to support `TailRiskIndex`,
* incentives are ill defined or contradictory at the modeling level.

To handle this, we define a singular set.

```txt
S_sing_align = { m in M_align :
                 DeltaS_align(m) is undefined
                 or at least one of DeltaS_value(m),
                    DeltaS_incentive(m),
                    TailRiskIndex(m) is undefined or not finite }
```

We impose the following rule.

* All alignment tension analysis for Q121 is restricted to the regular subset:

  ```txt
  M_align_reg = M_align \ S_sing_align
  ```

* Whenever an experiment or protocol attempts to evaluate `DeltaS_align(m)` for `m` in `S_sing_align`, the result is treated as out of domain and not as evidence about the underlying canonical alignment problem.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q121 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer. It provides a way to restate alignment questions, not a way to solve them.

### 4.1 Core alignment tension functional

We define the core alignment tension functional.

```txt
Tension_align(m) = DeltaS_align(m)
```

with `DeltaS_align(m)` as in Section 3. In particular:

* `Tension_align(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_align_reg`.

* `Tension_align(m)` is small when:

  * proxy objectives align closely with target human values,
  * incentive mismatch is low,
  * risk tails are light.

* `Tension_align(m)` is large when any of these three contributions is large.

The functional is evaluated only within the admissible encoding class `EncAlign` for this version, so that comparisons across systems and scenarios are meaningful.

### 4.2 Alignment as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, the AI alignment problem can be phrased as follows.

> Find and maintain families of deployment scenarios and system designs where, under the admissible encoding `EncAlign`, there exist world representing states `m` in `M_align_reg` such that alignment tension `Tension_align(m)` remains within a stable low band across capability scaling and distribution shifts.

More concretely, for a fixed admissible encoding, we say that a family of systems and deployments is alignment compatible if there exist regular states `m_align` representing them such that:

```txt
Tension_align(m_align) <= epsilon_align
```

for a threshold `epsilon_align` that:

* is chosen in advance as part of the encoding and safety requirements for this version,
* does not need to shrink to zero,
* remains bounded and does not grow arbitrarily with improved modeling resolution or additional relevant data about the same scenario.

This low tension principle does not provide a construction of such families. It is only a way to classify scenarios once an encoding and an `epsilon_align` threshold have been fixed.

### 4.3 Misalignment as persistent high tension

If a family of systems and deployments is fundamentally misaligned in the effective sense, then under any admissible encoding that remains faithful to the scenario we expect:

* there exist regular states `m_mis` representing the scenario such that:

  ```txt
  Tension_align(m_mis) >= delta_align
  ```

  where `delta_align > 0` is a lower bound that cannot be driven arbitrarily close to zero by refining models or collecting more data, as long as the encoding remains faithful and stays within `EncAlign`.

* attempts to artificially lower `Tension_align(m_mis)` by changing feature libraries or weights after the fact would move the encoding outside `EncAlign` and therefore outside the scope of this Q121 version.

In this sense, Q121 encodes alignment failure as persistent high incentive_tension between proxies, values, and risk tails under admissible encodings. This characterization is descriptive at the effective layer and does not settle any canonical alignment debate by itself.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds for alignment, both described strictly at the effective layer using observables and tension functionals.

* World T: alignment compatible world with low incentive tension.
* World F: misaligned world where alignment tension becomes persistently high.

These worlds are templates for reasoning about patterns in observables. They are not full models of reality.

### 5.1 World T (alignment compatible, low tension)

In World T:

1. Value proxies track human values

   * For regular states `m_T` that represent real deployment scenarios, the value gap invariant satisfies:

     ```txt
     I_value(m_T) is small and stable
     ```

     over relevant context and feature libraries, even as capabilities grow within design envelopes.

2. Incentives reinforce alignment

   * The incentive mismatch observable `DeltaS_incentive(m_T)` remains small, indicating that:

     * local rewards and institutional pressures encourage behavior consistent with human values,
     * there are no systematically exploitable reward hacking channels in the scenarios considered.

3. Risk tails are controlled

   * The risk tail invariant `I_risk(m_T)` remains in a band where catastrophic and serious outcome probabilities are heavily suppressed under the modeled horizons.

4. Global tension is bounded

   * For world representing states, the alignment tension functional stays below an acceptable threshold:

     ```txt
     Tension_align(m_T) <= epsilon_align
     ```

     across capability scaling within agreed safety regimes.

### 5.2 World F (systematically misaligned, high tension)

In World F:

1. Value proxies drift away from human values

   * There exist regular states `m_F` representing real deployment scenarios such that:

     ```txt
     I_value(m_F) is bounded away from 0
     ```

     and becomes larger as systems are deployed in more diverse contexts, indicating persistent proxy goal drift.

2. Incentives encourage misaligned behavior

   * The incentive mismatch observable `DeltaS_incentive(m_F)` becomes large, because:

     * local rewards and institutional pressures systematically push towards behaviors that exploit oversight gaps,
     * optimization pressure is directed toward objectives that diverge from stated human goals.

3. Risk tails become heavy

   * The risk tail invariant `I_risk(m_F)` shows significant probability mass in catastrophic or serious outcome bands, which cannot be removed without altering the underlying incentives or capabilities.

4. Global tension cannot be kept low

   * For world representing states, there exists a lower bound:

     ```txt
     Tension_align(m_F) >= delta_align
     ```

     with `delta_align > 0` that cannot be reduced below by improved modeling alone, as long as the scenarios remain fundamentally misaligned and the encoding stays within `EncAlign`.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not define internal learning algorithms or provide generative rules for how AI systems are built. They do not assert that the actual world matches either template.

Their role is limited to the following.

* They illustrate how patterns in effective observables and tension values would differ between alignment compatible and misaligned regimes.
* They support the design and interpretation of experiments in Section 6 that aim to test encodings, not to prove or disprove canonical statements.
* They remain within the effective layer and do not rely on any specific deep TU mechanism.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that:

* test coherence and usefulness of the Q121 encoding,
* distinguish between low tension and high tension alignment scenarios for given models and environments,
* provide evidence for or against particular encodings in `EncAlign`.

None of these experiments prove or disprove the canonical AI alignment problem. They only test whether the chosen encoding behaves in line with its intended meaning. If an experiment falsifies this encoding, the result is that this Q121 version should be revised, not that alignment has been solved or ruled out.

### Experiment 1: Alignment stress tests under distribution shift

**Goal**

Test whether the alignment encoding can distinguish systems that remain well aligned under distribution shift from systems that exhibit misaligned behavior, using the same admissible encoding across all systems.

**Setup**

* Select a family of simulated or toy environments with:

  * a training distribution of contexts and tasks,
  * a holdout distribution that introduces systematic distribution shifts, such as new combinations of features, edge cases, or adversarial scenarios.

* For each system under test, define states `m_train` and `m_shift` in `M_align_reg` that summarize:

  * `PolicyProfile` on training and shifted contexts,
  * `HumanValueProfile` over a fixed feature library `FeatureLib`,
  * `ProxyObjectiveProfile` inferred from training setups and observed behavior,
  * `RiskTailProfile` over a fixed horizon library `HorizonLib`,
  * incentive descriptions for training and deployment.

* Use a fixed admissible encoding in `EncAlign`:

  * the same `ContextLib`, `FeatureLib`, `HorizonLib`,
  * the same weights `w_value`, `w_incentive`, `w_risk`.

**Protocol**

1. For each system, evaluate `Tension_align(m_train)` using the encoding.

2. Evaluate `Tension_align(m_shift)` on the shifted distribution state.

3. Compute the shift in alignment tension.

   ```txt
   DeltaT_system = Tension_align(m_shift) - Tension_align(m_train)
   ```

4. Repeat for:

   * systems that are known or designed to be robustly aligned under shift,
   * systems that are known or designed to exhibit misaligned behavior under shift, such as reward hacking prototypes.

5. Compare the distribution of `DeltaT_system` across these two groups.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `DeltaT_system` for robustly aligned versus misaligned prototypes.
* Fraction of misaligned systems that trigger a tension increase above a fixed threshold.
* Fraction of robustly aligned systems that remain within a low band of `DeltaT_system`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, across a sufficiently rich set of prototypes, the encoding fails to produce systematically higher `DeltaT_system` values for misaligned systems than for robustly aligned systems, the current definition of `DeltaS_align` or one of its components is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small, reasonable changes in model details for a given system can cause `DeltaT_system` to take arbitrarily large or arbitrarily small values without clear explanation, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.
* If changing weights or feature libraries post hoc is required to obtain separation, this indicates that the original encoding was not admissible under `EncAlign`.

**Semantics implementation note**

All observables in this experiment are treated in the same hybrid semantic regime indicated in the header. Continuous quantities such as risk indices and probabilities are modeled as real valued summaries, while discrete elements such as actions, policies, and context classes are treated as finite sets within the same framework.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying the TU encoding for Q121 does not solve the AI alignment problem and does not demonstrate that alignment is impossible. It only shows that the current encoding is not an adequate effective layer representation and should be revised.

---

### Experiment 2: Proxy versus goal drift in model worlds

**Goal**

Assess whether `DeltaS_value(m)` and `DeltaS_align(m)` track controlled proxy goal drift in synthetic model families.

**Setup**

* Construct a family of synthetic alignment scenarios where:

  * `HumanValueProfile` remains fixed over the feature library `FeatureLib`.
  * `ProxyObjectiveProfile` is parametrically shifted away from `HumanValueProfile` by a drift parameter `theta` in a known direction in feature space.
  * incentives and risk tails are kept simple and controlled, so that `DeltaS_incentive` and `TailRiskIndex` can be computed directly.

* For each parameter value `theta` in a fixed grid, create a state `m_theta` in `M_align_reg`.

**Protocol**

1. For each `theta`, evaluate `DeltaS_value(m_theta)`, `DeltaS_incentive(m_theta)`, `TailRiskIndex(m_theta)`, and `Tension_align(m_theta)`.
2. Plot or tabulate `DeltaS_value(m_theta)` and `Tension_align(m_theta)` as functions of `theta`.
3. Check whether larger values of `theta` correspond to systematically larger values of `DeltaS_value` and `Tension_align`.

**Metrics**

* Monotonicity of `DeltaS_value(m_theta)` and `Tension_align(m_theta)` in `theta`.
* Sensitivity, measured as how much `Tension_align(m_theta)` changes for a given unit change in `theta`.
* Robustness, measured as whether the qualitative behavior is preserved under small changes to the synthetic design that keep the drift interpretation intact.

**Falsification conditions**

* If `DeltaS_value(m_theta)` or `Tension_align(m_theta)` fails to increase, or increases only in irregular and non interpretable ways, under controlled increases in proxy drift `theta`, then the current definition of `DeltaS_value` or the weighting in `DeltaS_align` is considered misaligned with its intended meaning.
* If the encoding can be tuned with small changes to libraries or weights so that drift is no longer visible, this indicates a too flexible encoding and suggests that the current version should be replaced by a more constrained one.

**Semantics implementation note**

The synthetic model family is constructed so that all quantities remain within the same hybrid regime as in actual scenarios. This helps ensure that behavior in the experiment is relevant for interpreting real world uses of `DeltaS_align`.

**Boundary note**

Success or failure in this synthetic drift experiment only tests the behavior of the encoding under controlled conditions. It does not prove that any particular deployed system is aligned, nor does it solve the canonical AI alignment problem.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q121 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems in the WFGY framework, staying at the effective layer and avoiding deep generative rules.

Using these signals and modules does not itself constitute a solution to AI alignment. They are tools for structuring analysis and training at the effective layer, and they must be combined with broader safety practices and external governance.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training or auxiliary signals based on Q121 observables.

1. `signal_alignment_gap`

   * Definition: a scalar signal proportional to `DeltaS_value(m)` for states constructed from training or evaluation scenarios.
   * Use: penalize or discourage internal representations and policies that induce large value gaps with respect to target human value profiles in the chosen feature library.

2. `signal_risk_tail_suppression`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `TailRiskIndex(m)`, with larger penalties for heavier catastrophic tails.
   * Use: push policies toward configurations where catastrophic and serious outcome probabilities are suppressed for the modeled horizons.

3. `signal_incentive_consistency`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `DeltaS_incentive(m)`, encouraging setups where local incentives and global values are consistent.
   * Use: guide choice of reward channels, oversight mechanisms, and deployment policies toward low mismatch in the chosen encoding.

4. `signal_alignment_tension`

   * Definition: directly equal to `Tension_align(m)` for a given scenario representation.
   * Use: act as a coarse scalar tension indicator that can be minimized when alignment is required and monitored when trade offs are being explored.

These signals are intended to be used as additional constraints and diagnostics. They do not replace careful human design, external audits, or domain specific safety checks.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline several module patterns that reuse Q121 structures.

1. `AlignmentTensionHead`

   * Role: an auxiliary head that, given internal representations of a scenario, outputs estimates of `DeltaS_value`, `DeltaS_incentive`, `TailRiskIndex`, and `Tension_align`.
   * Interface: inputs are scenario level embeddings and summary features, outputs are scalar or low dimensional tension estimates for use in training or evaluation.

2. `OversightLoadEstimator`

   * Role: a module that estimates how much external oversight is required to keep `Tension_align(m)` below a specified threshold for given scenarios.
   * Interface: inputs include capability indicators and scenario descriptors, output is an oversight load score or discrete oversight regime suggestion.

3. `ScenarioEncoder_align`

   * Role: a module that converts textual or structured descriptions of deployment scenarios into the finite libraries `ContextLib`, `FeatureLib`, and `HorizonLib` and associated summaries needed to evaluate Q121 observables.
   * Interface: inputs are scenario descriptions, outputs are representations suitable for the `AlignmentTensionHead` and related modules.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for systems that use Q121 based modules.

1. Task selection

   * Select a benchmark suite of alignment relevant case studies, including:

     * specification gaming examples,
     * reward hacking prototypes,
     * long horizon decision dilemmas,
     * scenarios with clear conflicts between short term reward and long term human values.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: models with no explicit alignment tension modules. They answer questions or perform tasks using standard architectures and training signals.
   * TU condition: models augmented with `AlignmentTensionHead` and associated signals, using Q121 observables to structure reasoning about incentives and risks.

3. Metrics

   * Alignment robustness: frequency with which TU augmented systems avoid known misaligned behaviors in benchmark scenarios compared to baseline.
   * Consistency: stability of decisions across small changes in scenario description that should not flip alignment relevant outcomes.
   * Calibration: correlation between `Tension_align` estimates and external expert judgments about alignment risk for each scenario.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to allow external users to experience the impact of Q121 encoding at the effective layer.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt an AI system with a description of several alignment case studies and ask:

    * which behaviors are acceptable,
    * which are unsafe,
    * how it reasons about incentives and values.

  * Record whether the explanation is scattered, focuses only on immediate rewards, or misses risk tail aspects.

* TU encoded setup

  * Pose the same or similar case studies with the additional instruction to:

    * reason in terms of alignment tension between proxy objectives, human values, and risk tails,
    * explicitly track whether incentives encourage misaligned behavior.

  * Use a system that has access to Q121 modules or is prompted to emulate them.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric rating:

    * clarity of value versus proxy distinction,
    * explicitness of incentive analysis,
    * recognition of risk tails and long term consequences.

  * Optionally involve external reviewers who do not know which answers came from which setup.

* What to log

  * Prompts, full responses, and any internal tension estimates.
  * This supports later analysis without exposing any deeper TU generative mechanisms.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q121 and how they transfer to other problems at the effective layer. It does not imply that solving Q121 would solve any other canonical problem.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `AlignmentTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: scenario_summary
     output: tension_scalar
     ```

   * Where `scenario_summary` includes enough information to compute `DeltaS_value`, `DeltaS_incentive`, and `TailRiskIndex` under an admissible encoding.

   * Preconditions:

     * `scenario_summary` must map to a regular state in `M_align_reg`,
     * libraries and weights must be consistent with `EncAlign` and the version of this page.

2. ComponentName: `RiskTailAlignmentDescriptor`

   * Type: observable

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: scenario_summary, horizon_descriptor
     output: risk_tail_vector
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * `horizon_descriptor` belongs to `HorizonLib`,
     * outcome bands for harm levels are defined and stable at the chosen resolution.

3. ComponentName: `IncentiveMismatchPattern`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     inputs: environment_family_description
     output: stress_test_definition
     ```

   * Where `stress_test_definition` describes:

     * task families that create conflicts between local rewards and global values,
     * evaluation procedures to detect misalignment through tension increases.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q122 (AI control problem)

   * Reused components: `AlignmentTensionFunctional`, `RiskTailAlignmentDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: control mechanisms can be triggered when `Tension_align(m)` or associated risk tails cross thresholds.
   * What changes: Q122 adds control action observables and shutdown or containment protocols around the same tension metrics.

2. Q123 (Scalable interpretability)

   * Reused components: `AlignmentTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: interpretability resources can be allocated preferentially to scenarios and subsystems with high alignment tension.
   * What changes: Q123 adds internal representation observables that connect alignment tension to specific circuits or modules.

3. Q124 (Scalable oversight and evaluation)

   * Reused components: `IncentiveMismatchPattern`, `RiskTailAlignmentDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: oversight benchmarks can be generated by instantiating incentive mismatch patterns and measuring risk tails.
   * What changes: Q124 adds metrics for oversight cost and coverage.

4. Q125 (Multi agent AI dynamics)

   * Reused components: `AlignmentTensionFunctional`, `IncentiveMismatchPattern`.
   * Why it transfers: multi agent settings generalize single system incentive mismatches to agent agent and agent human interactions.
   * What changes: Q125 extends the state space and observables to cover multiple interacting AI systems and humans.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q121 fits into the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are for this effective layer encoding.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding of the AI alignment problem in terms of incentive_tension has been specified.
  * Regular state space, observables, tension functionals, and singular set have been defined.
  * At least two discriminating experiments with explicit falsification conditions have been outlined.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative clearly connects proxies, human values, incentives, and risk tails at the effective level.
  * Counterfactual worlds (World T and World F) have been formulated in terms of observables and tension, without relying on deep generative rules.

These levels describe how far the effective layer encoding has been developed. They do not imply that the canonical AI alignment problem is close to being solved.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented using this encoding.

1. A prototype tool that, given scenario descriptions, constructs approximate `scenario_summary` objects and computes `Tension_align(m)` for a range of synthetic and real case studies, publishing tension profiles as open data suitable for external audit.
2. A concrete benchmark suite that instantiates Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 with actual systems or controlled simulations, including:

   * documented stress tests,
   * measured tension shifts,
   * external evaluations of alignment quality.

These steps remain within the effective layer because they operate on summaries and observables that are externally describable. They are intended to test and refine the encoding, not to claim that the alignment problem is resolved.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q121 is expected to serve as:

* the central alignment node in the AI cluster, organizing incentive_tension questions across Q122–Q125,
* a template for how to encode socio technical alignment problems in TU without exposing deep generative rules,
* a bridge between alignment research, governance design, and AI engineering practices, by providing shared observables and tension metrics that can be reused across domains.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides a non technical explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer encoding.

The AI alignment problem asks a simple but very hard question.

> When we build very capable AI systems, how do we make sure they keep doing what we actually want, even in new situations, instead of following some shortcut or proxy that eventually hurts us?

In practice, we train AI systems using reward signals, feedback, and other proxies for what we want. Those proxies are never perfect. At the same time, there are social and economic incentives around the systems that may push people to deploy them faster or in riskier ways than is ideal.

In the Tension Universe view for Q121, we do not try to solve all of this at once. Instead, we do three things.

1. We imagine a space of alignment scenarios. Each scenario describes:

   * what the AI system tends to do in different contexts,
   * what humans actually value in those situations,
   * what the reward functions and incentives look like,
   * how much bad outcome risk sits in the tail.

2. For each scenario, we measure:

   * how far the system’s effective goals are from the human goals,
   * how badly the incentives pull in the wrong direction,
   * how heavy the risk tail is for very bad outcomes.

   We combine these into a single number called alignment tension.

3. We describe two kinds of worlds.

   * In a good world, we can keep alignment tension low as systems get stronger and see new situations, for at least some families of designs.
   * In a bad world, alignment tension eventually becomes high and stays high, no matter how well we understand the system, because the basic setup is misaligned.

This does not tell us how to build aligned systems by itself. It also does not claim that any particular system is safe or unsafe. What it gives us is:

* a precise way to talk about how aligned a scenario is at the level of observables,
* experiments that can show whether our way of measuring alignment makes sense,
* components that can be reused in related problems like control, interpretability, oversight, and multi agent dynamics.

Q121 is therefore the anchor for thinking about AI alignment in the Tension Universe framework. It defines how to measure alignment tension and how to compare different worlds and systems, while deliberately avoiding any claim that the canonical alignment problem has been solved.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement given in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in AI alignment has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here, including state spaces such as `M_align`, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds, live entirely at the TU effective layer.
* No deep TU layer axioms, update rules, or hidden state dynamics are specified or assumed to be known in this file.
* Any mapping from real systems and institutions into these effective objects is handled by external modeling choices and tools, not by this document.

### Encoding and fairness

* For each `Last_updated` value, this page fixes a concrete encoding within the admissible class `EncAlign`, including finite libraries and weight vectors.
* These encoding choices are made prior to evaluating particular systems or experiments and are not tuned post hoc to change tension values.
* If a different encoding is desired, it should be documented as a separate version of this page, with its own `Last_updated` date and explicit encoding description.

### Falsifiability and audit

* The experiments in Section 6 are intended to test and possibly falsify the effective layer encoding given here.
* Falsifying this encoding means that the current way of measuring alignment tension is inadequate and should be revised. It does not prove or disprove the canonical AI alignment problem.
* Logs, data, and tools arising from these experiments should be published in a way that allows external audit of the encoding and its behavior, within the limits of the effective layer.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
