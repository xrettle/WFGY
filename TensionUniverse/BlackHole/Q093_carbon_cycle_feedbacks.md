## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only specify:

  * state spaces,
  * observables and invariants,
  * tension functionals,
  * counterfactual worlds,
  * and experiment templates.
* We do not specify:

  * any TU core axiom system,
  * any deep generative rule for internal fields,
  * any constructive derivation of TU itself.

In particular:

* We do not claim to solve the physical science problem of full carbon cycle feedbacks.
* We do not claim any new theorem about the real Earth system.
* We do not define how raw observations or model outputs are mapped into the effective state space `M`.
  That mapping belongs to the implementation layer and can differ across applications, as long as it respects the encoding constraints described here and in the TU charters.

All encoding choices in this page are controlled by:

* the finite encoding family `A_enc(Q093)` defined in Section 3.6,
* the specific element of that family identified in the header by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1`,
* and the TU Effective Layer, Encoding and Fairness, and Tension Scale charters referenced in the footer.

Experiments and falsification conditions in Section 6 test the compatibility of this encoding with observations and model ensembles at the effective layer. They do not test the TU core itself and they do not prove or disprove any canonical scientific statement in Section 1.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem of Q093 is:

> Describe, constrain, and stress test the full set of carbon cycle feedbacks in the Earth system, across atmosphere, ocean, land biosphere, soils, and frozen carbon reservoirs, in a way that:
>
> 1. closes carbon budgets across relevant time scales,
> 2. quantifies net feedback strength and sign,
> 3. and identifies regimes that lead to long term stable, weakly amplifying, or runaway behavior.

In classical Earth system science, the global carbon cycle is partitioned into:

* reservoirs:

  * atmosphere,
  * surface ocean,
  * deep ocean,
  * land vegetation,
  * soils,
  * permafrost and other frozen carbon,
  * geological reservoirs;
* fluxes between these reservoirs:

  * photosynthesis and respiration,
  * air–sea gas exchange,
  * vertical and lateral ocean circulation,
  * weathering and geological outgassing,
  * fossil fuel and industrial emissions,
  * land use and land cover change;
* feedback processes that modify these fluxes and stocks in response to climate changes and rising atmospheric CO2.

The central questions for Q093 are:

* What is the net feedback factor of the carbon cycle on climate time scales from decades to millennia?
* Under which conditions do carbon sinks in land and ocean saturate or reverse and become net sources?
* Are there combinations of feedbacks that can drive long lived or nearly irreversible changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate, even if anthropogenic emissions decline?

This problem is not a single theorem. It is a coupled system question about consistency, stability, and tail risk in a complex dynamical network.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Current knowledge includes:

* Quantitative models of carbon reservoirs and fluxes, from simple box models to fully coupled Earth system models.
* Observational constraints on:

  * atmospheric CO2 rise,
  * ocean carbon uptake,
  * land biosphere and soil carbon changes,
  * partial estimates of permafrost and other frozen carbon responses.
* First order estimates of carbon–climate feedback parameters, such as the sensitivity of land and ocean carbon sinks to warming or increasing CO2.

Major difficulties remain:

* Large uncertainty in long term feedbacks from:

  * soil carbon decomposition under warming,
  * permafrost thaw and associated methane and CO2 release,
  * saturation and circulation driven changes in ocean carbon uptake,
  * vegetation shifts and disturbance regimes.
* Strong coupling between physical climate, hydrology, ecosystems, and human emissions pathways.
* Deep uncertainty in tail behavior:

  * how large net positive feedbacks can become,
  * how quickly systems can cross thresholds that change the sign or magnitude of feedbacks.

As a result, the full carbon cycle feedback problem remains open in the sense that:

* we lack universally accepted bounds on net feedback strength,
* we lack robust characterization of runaway or self sustaining feedback scenarios,
* and we lack a single agreed framework for comparing feedback patterns across models and observations.

Q093 aims to encode these issues as thermodynamic_tension on carbon budgets and feedback indices, without claiming to solve the physical science problem itself.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem graph, Q093 plays several roles:

1. It is the main node for thermodynamic_tension arising from coupled carbon reservoirs and feedback loops in the modern Earth system.
2. It provides the carbon side of the link between:

   * Q091 (equilibrium climate sensitivity),
   * and Q092 (climate tipping points),
     because carbon feedbacks help determine how much forcing is applied for a given emission history.
3. It serves as a template for:

   * encoding budget closure,
   * encoding feedback indices,
   * defining low tension versus high tension regimes in long lived dynamical systems.
4. It exports reusable components:

   * a carbon feedback kernel,
   * a carbon budget constraint observable,
     that other Earth and socio technical problems can reuse when they depend on climate forcing.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q093 is connected to other S problems. Each edge has a one line reason pointing to concrete components.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These nodes provide prerequisites or general structure that Q093 relies on.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Supplies the climate sensitivity framework that carbon feedbacks feed into through their effect on atmospheric CO2 and radiative forcing.

* Q092 (BH_EARTH_TIPPING_L3_092)
  Reason: Provides the generic tipping and hysteresis structure that Q093 uses to interpret strong positive feedback regimes and thresholds.

* Q094 (BH_EARTH_OCEAN_MIX_L3_094)
  Reason: Constrains ocean mixing and circulation patterns that strongly affect the long term behavior of the ocean carbon sink and feedback indices used in Q093.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These nodes reuse Q093 components or rely directly on its tension structure.

* Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)
  Reason: Reuses the CarbonFeedbackKernel and CarbonBudgetConstraint to classify long term Anthropocene system states and their stability.

* Q099 (BH_EARTH_WATER_STRESS_L3_099)
  Reason: Uses Q093 tension patterns as upstream forcing for climate states that determine global freshwater stress and hydrological extremes.

* Q100 (BH_EARTH_PANDEMIC_RISK_L3_100)
  Reason: Treats Q093 driven climate trajectories as exogenous drivers in models of ecological and socio technical conditions for pandemic risk.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types or structure but no direct component dependence.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Both Q091 and Q093 encode long term thermodynamic_tension in Earth system responses. Q091 focuses on temperature sensitivity and radiative forcing, while Q093 focuses on internal carbon feedback loops.

* Q092 (BH_EARTH_TIPPING_L3_092)
  Reason: Both describe nonlinear feedbacks and thresholds. Q093 is a specific carbon system instance of the general tipping framework in Q092.

* Q095 (BH_EARTH_BIODIVERSITY_L3_095)
  Reason: Both involve biosphere responses to climate forcing. Q095 tracks biodiversity states, Q093 tracks carbon stocks and fluxes.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q093 to problems in other domains that reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses thermodynamic and information balance concepts to interpret Q093 carbon budget and feedback tension as constraints on long term entropy and information flow in Earth system models.

* Q101 (BH_ECON_EQUITY_PREM_L3_101)
  Reason: Uses Q093 tail risk in net carbon feedbacks as an upstream driver of macro level climate risk and resulting equity risk premiums.

* Q105 (BH_COMPLEX_CRASHES_L3_105)
  Reason: Reuses Q093 style feedback and stability structures to analyze systemic crash risks in coupled climate–economic–ecological systems.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content here is at the effective layer. We only define:

* state space and fields,
* observables and invariants,
* tension quantities,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* the admissible encoding family `A_enc(Q093)` used in this problem.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or mappings from raw data to internal fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a state space `M` with the following interpretation.

Each state `m` in `M` represents a coarse grained configuration of the global carbon cycle at a chosen time scale and spatial resolution. For a fixed resolution, a state `m` encodes:

* reservoir stocks:

  * atmospheric carbon (mainly CO2),
  * upper ocean carbon,
  * deep ocean carbon,
  * land vegetation carbon,
  * soil carbon,
  * frozen carbon (for example permafrost),
* fluxes between reservoirs:

  * air–sea gas exchange,
  * land–atmosphere fluxes from photosynthesis, respiration, and disturbance,
  * vertical and lateral ocean exchange,
  * river and coastal transfers,
  * anthropogenic emissions and removals,
* climate state variables relevant to carbon feedbacks:

  * global mean surface temperature,
  * simple indices of regional warming patterns,
  * hydrological indicators such as soil moisture indices.

We do not specify how these summaries are constructed from observations or model outputs. We only require that for each time window and resolution of interest there exist states in `M` that encode physically coherent stocks, fluxes, and climate indicators consistent with that window and resolution.

### 3.2 Effective observables and fields

We define nonnegative or bounded observables on `M` that will be used to construct tension functionals.

1. Reservoir stock observable

```txt
C_res(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, reservoir label `r` in a finite set of reservoirs.
* Output: effective carbon stock associated with reservoir `r` in state `m`.

2. Flux observable

```txt
F_flux(m; r1, r2)
```

* Input: state `m`, ordered pair of reservoirs `(r1, r2)`.
* Output: effective net carbon flux from `r1` to `r2` over a reference time scale.

3. Feedback coefficient observable

```txt
lambda_fb(m; r)
```

* Input: state `m`, reservoir label `r`.
* Output: effective feedback coefficient that summarizes how small changes in climate state affect net fluxes or stocks associated with reservoir `r`.
* Interpretation: a positive value indicates that warming tends to increase net emissions from reservoir `r`. A negative value indicates the opposite.

4. Carbon budget mismatch observable

Given a time window `W` and a set of reservoirs and fluxes, define:

```txt
DeltaS_budget(m; W) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, time window `W`.
* Output: nonnegative scalar that measures mismatch between:

  * the sum of emissions and sinks over `W`,
  * and the net change in total carbon stored across the reservoirs in `W`.
* `DeltaS_budget` is zero if the budget closes exactly and grows as the mismatch increases, after accounting for uncertainty bands that are fixed by the encoding specification.

5. Net feedback deviation observable

```txt
DeltaS_feedback(m) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: nonnegative scalar that measures how far the vector of feedback coefficients `{lambda_fb(m; r)}` lies from a reference band considered physically plausible for the chosen time scale.

The reference band may depend on:

* basic physical constraints such as conservation laws,
* paleoclimate evidence,
* model ensembles.

It is fixed in advance for a given encoding and is not tuned after looking at outcomes.

6. Tail behavior indicator

We introduce a simple tail behavior scalar:

```txt
R_tail(m) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: nonnegative index that summarizes the amplitude of high impact, low probability feedback combinations in the encoded configuration. Examples include:

  * extreme permafrost release events,
  * combined weakening or reversal of land and ocean sinks,
  * disturbance regimes that rapidly release stored carbon at large scale.

The precise construction of `R_tail` is not specified here. It is only required that:

* `R_tail(m) = 0` corresponds to configurations with no identified extreme feedback combinations,
* larger values indicate more severe or likely extreme feedback scenarios,
* the functional form is chosen once for the encoding and becomes part of the encoding specification.

### 3.3 Combined mismatch and risk indicators

For a fixed encoding, we select a reference window `W_ref` from a finite library of time windows suited to Q093 (for example several decades or a century).

We then collect mismatch and risk information into:

```txt
X_budget_fb(m) = (DeltaS_budget(m; W_ref), DeltaS_feedback(m))
R_tail(m)
```

These quantities will feed into the scalar carbon tension functional.

### 3.4 Core carbon tension functional

At the effective layer we define the core scalar tension functional:

```txt
DeltaS_carbon(m) =
    a_budget * DeltaS_budget(m; W_ref)
  + a_fb     * DeltaS_feedback(m)
  + a_tail   * R_tail(m)
```

where:

* `a_budget`, `a_fb`, `a_tail` are fixed nonnegative weights,
* at least one of these weights is strictly positive,
* all three weights are selected from a finite library associated with `A_enc(Q093)` and remain fixed for the encoding identified by `Encoding_key`.

Properties:

* `DeltaS_carbon(m) >= 0` for all `m` in the regular domain.
* `DeltaS_carbon(m)` is small when:

  * carbon budgets close within accepted uncertainty bands,
  * feedback coefficients lie inside the reference band,
  * identified extreme feedback combinations are mild or absent.
* `DeltaS_carbon(m)` becomes large when:

  * budgets fail to close,
  * feedback coefficients move outside plausible ranges,
  * extreme feedback configurations become prominent.

### 3.5 Invariants

For later use and transfer, we name three invariants that are implicit in the previous definitions.

1. Budget invariant

```txt
I_budget(m) = DeltaS_budget(m; W_ref)
```

2. Feedback invariant

```txt
I_feedback(m) = DeltaS_feedback(m)
```

3. Tail invariant

```txt
I_tail_carbon(m) = R_tail(m)
```

Then the carbon tension functional can be written as:

```txt
DeltaS_carbon(m) =
    a_budget * I_budget(m)
  + a_fb     * I_feedback(m)
  + a_tail   * I_tail_carbon(m)
```

All three invariants and the weight triple belong to the encoding identified by `Encoding_key`.

### 3.6 Admissible encoding class A_enc(Q093)

We now define the admissible encoding family `A_enc(Q093)` for this problem.

An element `e` in `A_enc(Q093)` consists of:

* a choice of:

  * finite reservoir set and flux pairs,
  * reference window `W_ref` in a finite library of time windows,
  * reference bands for carbon budget closure,
  * reference bands for feedback coefficients,
  * a functional template for `R_tail(m)`,
* a weight triple `(a_budget, a_fb, a_tail)` drawn from a finite set of rational weight triples,
* a threshold pair `(epsilon_carbon, delta_carbon)` with:

  * `epsilon_carbon >= 0`,
  * `delta_carbon > 0`,
  * selected from a finite library of candidate threshold pairs.

The TU Encoding and Fairness Charter requires that:

1. The finite libraries that define `A_enc(Q093)` are fixed before any experiment in this page is considered.
2. Once an element `e` in `A_enc(Q093)` is selected and bound to a concrete `Encoding_key`, all of its components are fixed for that key:

   * reservoir catalog and flux pairs,
   * definition of `W_ref`,
   * reference bands and their uncertainty treatment,
   * functional form and parameter ranges for `R_tail`,
   * weight triple `(a_budget, a_fb, a_tail)`,
   * threshold pair `(epsilon_carbon, delta_carbon)`.
3. Any change to these items corresponds to a different element of `A_enc(Q093)` and must be published as a new encoding key. It cannot be presented as the same encoding.

For this page, the header attribute:

```txt
Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1
```

identifies a single element `e_star` of `A_enc(Q093)`. All experiments and tension statements in this entry refer to `e_star`. When we discuss robustness across encodings, the phrase refers to the finite family `A_enc(Q093)`, not to arbitrary continuous tuning.

### 3.7 Effective tension tensor components

At the effective layer we introduce a semantic tension tensor `T_ij` over `M` consistent with the general TU core pattern:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_carbon(m) * lambda_state(m) * kappa_carbon
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` are source like factors that represent how strongly the i-th component of the system injects carbon related stress into the configuration, for example different sectors or regions.
* `C_j(m)` are receptivity like factors that represent how sensitive the j-th component is to changes in carbon stocks and fluxes, for example different ecological or socio technical layers.
* `DeltaS_carbon(m)` is the carbon tension scalar defined above.
* `lambda_state(m)` is a convergence state factor that encodes whether the configuration is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic under small perturbations.
* `kappa_carbon` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of carbon related thermodynamic_tension for this encoding.

We do not need explicit index sets for `i` and `j` in this block. It is sufficient that for each `m` in the regular domain and for all relevant indices, `T_ij(m)` is finite.

### 3.8 Singular set and domain restrictions

Not all configurations are suitable for evaluating carbon feedback tension. We define a singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
             DeltaS_budget(m; W_ref) is undefined or infinite
          or DeltaS_feedback(m) is undefined or infinite
          or R_tail(m) is undefined or infinite
          or DeltaS_carbon(m) is undefined or infinite
          or any C_res(m; r) < 0
         }
```

The regular domain is:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

Rules:

* All carbon tension analysis in this problem is restricted to `M_reg`.
* When an experiment or protocol would attempt to evaluate tension quantities for a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain and not as physical evidence about feedback behavior.
* Any encoding or dataset that systematically produces states in `S_sing` for otherwise well observed periods is considered misaligned or invalid for Q093 purposes.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q093 is characterized as a tension problem at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension principle

The core tension functional is `DeltaS_carbon(m)` built from the invariants `I_budget(m)`, `I_feedback(m)`, and `I_tail_carbon(m)` under a fixed encoding with thresholds `(epsilon_carbon, delta_carbon)`.

Informally:

* Low carbon tension corresponds to:

  * budgets that close within stable uncertainty bands,
  * feedback coefficients that remain inside reference ranges,
  * tail scenarios that are weak or rare.
* High carbon tension corresponds to:

  * budgets that fail to close even after revising data within plausible bounds,
  * feedback coefficients that move outside reference ranges and stay there,
  * tail scenarios that become prominent or hard to avoid.

We characterize two regimes.

### 4.2 Low tension carbon world

At the effective layer, a low tension carbon world is one in which:

* for the actual Earth system, there exist states `m_low` in `M_reg` that accurately represent multi decade to century scale carbon cycle behavior, and
* for these states, the carbon tension functional satisfies:

```txt
DeltaS_carbon(m_low) <= epsilon_carbon
```

for a small threshold `epsilon_carbon` drawn from the library associated with `A_enc(Q093)` and fixed by the encoding identified by `Encoding_key`.

In such worlds:

* net feedback factors remain in ranges that permit long term stabilization or slow growth of atmospheric CO2 for feasible emission pathways,
* carbon budgets can be closed in a way that is coherent with physical constraints and with the reference bands used by the encoding.

### 4.3 High tension or runaway carbon world

A high tension carbon world is one in which:

* for any encoding in `A_enc(Q093)` that remains faithful to available observations and basic physical constraints, states `m_high` that represent the actual system eventually satisfy:

```txt
DeltaS_carbon(m_high) >= delta_carbon
```

for a strictly positive `delta_carbon` taken from the threshold library and associated with that encoding, and this inequality cannot be driven arbitrarily close to equality by improving data or tuning models within the rules of the encoding class.

In such worlds:

* feedbacks and tail risk combinations are strong enough that:

  * carbon budgets cannot be closed without invoking implausible processes, or
  * long term trajectories of atmospheric CO2 and climate exhibit strong amplification or runaway behavior even under declining emissions.

Q093, at the effective layer, is the task of:

* defining and sharpening `DeltaS_carbon`,
* distinguishing low tension from high tension carbon worlds,
* and checking whether candidate encodings of the carbon cycle remain consistent with observations, physical constraints, and reasonable tail risk assessments.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds in terms of observables and tension quantities only.

### 5.1 World T (moderate and stabilizing feedbacks)

In World T:

1. Budget closure

   * For representative states `m_T` in `M_reg` that encode multi decade to century scale behavior, carbon budget mismatch stays within accepted uncertainty bands, so that:

     ```txt
     I_budget(m_T) = DeltaS_budget(m_T; W_ref)
     ```

     remains small and stable over successive periods.

2. Feedback coefficients

   * The vector of feedback coefficients `{lambda_fb(m_T; r)}` for key reservoirs remains inside the predefined reference band, so that:

     ```txt
     I_feedback(m_T) = DeltaS_feedback(m_T)
     ```

     stays low.

3. Tail risk indicator

   * Identified extreme feedback combinations are rare or weak, leading to small values of:

     ```txt
     I_tail_carbon(m_T) = R_tail(m_T)
     ```

4. Combined tension

   * As data and models improve, `DeltaS_carbon(m_T)` remains bounded by a low threshold `epsilon_carbon` for physically realistic encodings in `A_enc(Q093)`.

### 5.2 World F (strong positive or runaway feedbacks)

In World F:

1. Budget failures

   * For states `m_F` representing the actual system, attempts to close the carbon budget over medium or long time windows repeatedly yield large mismatches, so that:

     ```txt
     I_budget(m_F) = DeltaS_budget(m_F; W_ref)
     ```

     remains high even after accounting for observational uncertainty in a way that respects the encoding rules.

2. Feedback coefficients

   * Key reservoirs such as soils, permafrost, and ocean sinks display effective feedback coefficients that drift outside the reference band and remain there, so that:

     ```txt
     I_feedback(m_F) = DeltaS_feedback(m_F)
     ```

     takes persistently large values.

3. Tail risk indicator

   * Extreme feedback combinations become prominent or frequent, and:

     ```txt
     I_tail_carbon(m_F) = R_tail(m_F)
     ```

     is systematically high for configurations that match observations.

4. Combined tension

   * Any encoding in `A_enc(Q093)` that stays consistent with observational constraints and basic physical laws yields:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_carbon(m_F) >= delta_carbon
     ```

     where `delta_carbon > 0` is the high tension threshold associated with that encoding, and this threshold cannot be made arbitrarily small without leaving the admissible encoding class.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual descriptions do not construct internal fields from raw data. They only assert that:

* if the real Earth system behaves like World T, then effective states with low carbon tension should exist and remain stable under refinement,
* if it behaves like World F, then any faithful encoding in `A_enc(Q093)` will exhibit persistent high carbon tension.

Q093 does not claim to decide which world we inhabit. It provides a structured way to frame that question.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block defines experiments that can falsify particular Q093 encodings at the effective layer. They do not decide which counterfactual world is true and they do not refute the TU core.

Unless otherwise stated, all experiments in this section are carried out under the encoding identified by:

```txt
Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1
```

which corresponds to a specific element `e_star` in `A_enc(Q093)`.

### Experiment 1: Carbon budget closure tension from observational products

*Goal*

Test whether a given Q093 encoding assigns low carbon tension to observationally based estimates of the recent historical carbon budget, and whether this remains true under the finite set of parameter choices allowed by `A_enc(Q093)`.

*Setup*

* Input data:

  * atmospheric CO2 concentration time series over several decades,
  * estimates of fossil fuel emissions and land use change emissions,
  * estimates of land and ocean carbon sinks from observation based products and reanalysis.
* Construct time windows `W_ref` such as decade scale periods, chosen from the finite window library associated with the encoding.
* Fix for `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1`:

  * a reference band for budget mismatch,
  * a reference band for plausible feedback coefficients,
  * weights `a_budget`, `a_fb`, `a_tail`,
  * thresholds `(epsilon_carbon, delta_carbon)`.

*Protocol*

1. For each time window `W_ref`, form a state `m_data` in `M` that encodes:

   * reservoir stock changes,
   * integrated fluxes,
   * basic climate indicators.
     The method used to form `m_data` is external to TU and is not specified here.
2. Evaluate for each `m_data`:

   * `I_budget(m_data) = DeltaS_budget(m_data; W_ref)`,
   * `I_feedback(m_data) = DeltaS_feedback(m_data)`,
   * `I_tail_carbon(m_data) = R_tail(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_carbon(m_data)`.
3. Compare the resulting tension values to the thresholds `(epsilon_carbon, delta_carbon)` that define low and high tension regimes for this encoding.

*Metrics*

* Distribution of `I_budget(m_data)` across windows.
* Distribution of `I_feedback(m_data)` across windows.
* Distribution of `DeltaS_carbon(m_data)`, and the fraction of windows where it:

  * remains below `epsilon_carbon`,
  * exceeds `delta_carbon`.

*Falsification conditions*

For the encoding identified by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1`:

* If, across the observational windows considered, a large majority of `m_data` states yield `DeltaS_carbon(m_data)` above `delta_carbon` in periods where domain experts regard the system as historically moderate, the encoding is considered misaligned and rejected for Q093 at the effective layer.
* If small, justified changes within the finite parameter library associated with this encoding family can flip a large set of windows from low to high tension or back without a clear physical reason, the entire family of encodings in `A_enc(Q093)` that share those parameter ranges is considered unstable and rejected.

*Semantics implementation note*

All quantities are treated as continuous time averaged or aggregated fields, consistent with the metadata and the dynamical_field nature of Q093. No discrete jump processes are introduced inside this experiment block.

*Boundary note*

Falsifying a Q093 encoding or a subfamily of encodings does not solve the canonical scientific problem and does not refute the TU core. It only removes specific ways of mapping the carbon cycle into tension space.

---

### Experiment 2: Ensemble separation of stable and unstable carbon feedback regimes

*Goal*

Check whether the Q093 carbon tension functional can robustly distinguish between model ensemble members with weak to moderate feedbacks and members with strong, potentially runaway feedbacks.

*Setup*

* Input data:

  * ensemble simulations from Earth system models or simplified carbon cycle models,
  * each member labeled by its long term feedback behavior, for example using effective feedback factors derived from the simulations.
* Partition ensemble members into:

  * group S: members with stable or weakly amplifying feedbacks,
  * group U: members with strong or unstable feedbacks.
* Use the same encoding identified by `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1` as in Experiment 1.

*Protocol*

1. For each ensemble member and chosen time window in the library, form a state `m_S` or `m_U` in `M` that encodes:

   * reservoir stocks,
   * fluxes,
   * simple climate indicators,
     at the same resolution as in the observational experiment.
2. Evaluate for each state:

   * `I_budget`,
   * `I_feedback`,
   * `I_tail_carbon`,
   * and then `DeltaS_carbon`.
3. Compare the distributions of `DeltaS_carbon` between group S and group U.
4. Optionally repeat for other encodings in `A_enc(Q093)` to test whether separation quality is stable across the finite family, but keep encodings distinct and never mix keys in a single evaluation.

*Metrics*

* Mean and variance of `DeltaS_carbon` in group S and group U.
* Separation measures, for example:

  * fraction of group S members with `DeltaS_carbon` below `epsilon_carbon`,
  * fraction of group U members with `DeltaS_carbon` above `delta_carbon`.
* Sensitivity of separation to allowed parameter variation across different encoding keys in `A_enc(Q093)`.

*Falsification conditions*

For a given encoding key:

* If group S and group U cannot be separated in tension space better than random chance, the Q093 encoding is considered ineffective for engineering use.
* If the encoding systematically assigns lower `DeltaS_carbon` to clearly unstable members than to clearly stable members according to the construction of groups S and U, the encoding is considered misaligned with the intended thermodynamic_tension interpretation.

Across the finite family `A_enc(Q093)`:

* If no encoding produces a tension ranking that respects the group labels in a consistent way, the current design of `A_enc(Q093)` is considered inadequate and must be revised at the TU framework level.

*Semantics implementation note*

Model outputs are treated as generating continuous field summaries for stocks and fluxes. The same continuous field assumptions used in Experiment 1 are applied, so that experiments remain consistent.

*Boundary note*

Success or failure in separating model regimes tests only the quality of the Q093 encoding family, not the real world carbon cycle behavior and not the TU core.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q093 can be used as an engineering module in AI systems at the effective layer. All uses are conditional on a fixed encoding key and do not reveal any TU core mechanisms.

Unless stated otherwise, the discussion assumes `Encoding_key: TU_BH_Q093_CARBON_v1`.

### 7.1 Training signals

Possible training signals derived from Q093 include:

1. `signal_carbon_budget_closure`

   * Definition: a nonnegative penalty proportional to `I_budget(m)` in contexts where carbon accounting is central.
   * Use: discourage internal representations that imply impossible or highly inconsistent carbon budgets.

2. `signal_feedback_stability`

   * Definition: a penalty or reward based on `I_feedback(m)`, encouraging feedback coefficients to remain in plausible ranges when the context assumes physically realistic behavior.
   * Use: guide models to respect known constraints on net carbon cycle feedback strength.

3. `signal_tail_risk_carbon`

   * Definition: a signal derived from `I_tail_carbon(m)` that marks configurations with high potential for extreme carbon feedback scenarios.
   * Use: focus testing and interpretability methods on high risk configurations even if they are not the most probable.

4. `signal_carbon_tension_score`

   * Definition: direct use of `DeltaS_carbon(m)` as a scalar tension indicator.
   * Use: provide an auxiliary objective for models to keep explanations and reasoning in low tension regimes when scenarios are intended to be physically plausible.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

Q093 suggests several module patterns.

1. `CarbonBudgetConstraintLayer`

   * Role: a module that checks implied carbon budgets in multi step reasoning chains.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: summarized stocks, fluxes, and emissions from intermediate internal states.
     * Outputs: a budget mismatch metric and possibly a soft mask that downweights inconsistent branches.
   * The layer does not generate any TU internal fields. It only evaluates consistency of summaries.

2. `FeedbackResponseHead`

   * Role: an auxiliary head that predicts effective feedback coefficients `{lambda_fb}` and associated tension.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: encoded descriptions of climate scenarios and carbon system configurations.
     * Outputs: feedback coefficient summaries and an estimated `I_feedback` or `DeltaS_feedback`.

3. `TU_EarthSystemObserver`

   * Role: a general observer module that maps complex Earth system narratives into a compact feature vector suitable for computing Q093 tension quantities.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings of climate and carbon cycle text.
     * Outputs: features approximating `C_res`, `F_flux`, `lambda_fb`, and tail indicators.

All these modules operate at the effective layer and treat `DeltaS_carbon` and related invariants as observable scores attached to scenarios.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness to test AI systems using Q093 components could include:

1. Task set

   * Questions requiring:

     * explanation of carbon budget closure,
     * comparison of emission pathways and their long term implications,
     * reasoning about land and ocean sink behavior and their saturation,
     * recognition of scenarios that imply runaway feedback.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model operates without explicit Q093 modules.
   * Q093 enhanced condition:

     * the model uses CarbonBudgetConstraintLayer and FeedbackResponseHead as auxiliary modules and training signals under a fixed encoding key.

3. Metrics

   * Consistency of carbon accounting across multi step answers.
   * Accuracy in reproducing known qualitative patterns from the literature about sink behavior and feedbacks.
   * Reduction in internal contradictions between different parts of a scenario description.
   * Stability of `DeltaS_carbon` under small rephrasings of the same scenario.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal user facing protocol to experience Q093 encoding:

* Baseline prompt:

  * Ask the AI to explain how the global carbon cycle works, including feedbacks on climate, and to describe possible runaway scenarios, without any mention of tension or WFGY.
* Q093 guided prompt:

  * Ask the same question, with additional instructions:

    * to explicitly track carbon budgets,
    * to identify feedback loops,
    * to distinguish between stable and runaway regimes using a single scalar carbon tension score consistent with `DeltaS_carbon(m)`.

Comparison criteria:

* clarity of budget closure,
* explicit identification of feedback loops,
* explicit discussion of stability versus runaway behavior,
* internal consistency when scenarios are varied slightly.

What to log:

* prompts and full responses,
* any auxiliary values that approximate `I_budget`, `I_feedback`, `I_tail_carbon`, and `DeltaS_carbon`, if the system exposes them.
  These values must be treated as effective layer observables only and not as direct measurements of the real world.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components from Q093 and their direct reuse targets. Component definitions are at the effective layer and may be instantiated under different encoding keys as long as they respect the TU charters.

3. Target: Q098 (BH_EARTH_ANTHROPOCENE_L3_098)

   * Reused component:

     * `CarbonFeedbackKernel`,
     * `CarbonBudgetConstraint`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * long term Anthropocene trajectories are strongly shaped by net carbon feedbacks and budget behavior.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * Q093 has a defined effective layer encoding with:

    * state space `M`,
    * observables `C_res`, `F_flux`, `lambda_fb`,
    * mismatch and tail indicators `I_budget`, `I_feedback`, `I_tail_carbon`,
    * a scalar tension functional `DeltaS_carbon`,
    * a singular set `S_sing` and regular domain `M_reg`,
    * at least two fully specified experiments with falsification conditions,
    * an admissible encoding family `A_enc(Q093)` and a concrete encoding key.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative links:

    * carbon budgets,
    * feedback processes,
    * and thermodynamic_tension,
      in a coherent way.
  * Counterfactual worlds and transfer targets are described at a qualitative but precise level.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move Q093 from E1 to E2, the following measurable steps are required:

1. Explicit finite library

   * Define and publish the finite library that underlies `A_enc(Q093)`:

     * reservoir and flux configurations,
     * feedback patterns,
     * reference bands,
     * weight triples,
     * threshold pairs.

2. Coupling rules

   * Specify simple and explicit rules for coupling:

     * carbon feedback indices from Q093,
     * climate sensitivity metrics from Q091,
     * tipping structures from Q092.

3. Demonstration dataset

   * Implement at least one demonstration where:

     * `DeltaS_carbon` and its invariants are computed from observational and model ensemble data,
     * tension profiles are published as open data with clear uncertainty bands,
     * external groups can reproduce the results using the same encoding key.

These steps can be taken without revealing any deep generative rules. They operate solely on effective summaries consistent with the TU charters.

### 9.3 Long term role in TU

In the longer term, Q093 is expected to:

* become the central carbon related node for:

  * Earth system stability assessments,
  * climate risk analysis,
  * and cross coupling with economic and social S problems,
* provide stable reference components for:

  * equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity analyses,
  * tipping point studies,
  * Anthropocene system classification,
* serve as an example of how to encode complex biogeochemical cycles in terms of tension without overclaiming predictive power or proof status.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

For a non expert audience, Q093 asks:

* how the Earth carbon system pushes back on what we do,
* and when that pushback stays gentle instead of becoming dangerous.

The basic picture is:

* Carbon moves between the air, the ocean, plants, soils, and frozen ground.
* Human activities add extra carbon to the air.
* The Earth system responds:

  * some extra carbon is taken up by the ocean,
  * some is taken up by plants and soils,
  * some may be released from warming soils or thawing frozen ground.

These responses are called feedbacks. Some feedbacks help by taking up carbon. Others hurt by releasing even more.

In this problem we do not try to build a full numerical simulation of the Earth. Instead we:

1. Define summaries of:

   * how much carbon is in each reservoir,
   * how much flows between them,
   * how strongly these flows react to warming.
2. Check whether:

   * the accounting of carbon adds up, which is budget closure,
   * the feedbacks sit in ranges that seem physically plausible and safe,
   * there are combinations of feedbacks that could push the system into very dangerous regimes.

All this is compressed into one number called `DeltaS_carbon`.

* When `DeltaS_carbon` is small:

  * budgets close,
  * feedbacks are moderate,
  * extreme scenarios look unlikely.
* When `DeltaS_carbon` is large:

  * budgets fail to close,
  * feedbacks look too strong or too uncertain,
  * extreme scenarios are difficult to rule out.

We then imagine two types of worlds:

* in a low tension world, careful analysis of data and models keeps `DeltaS_carbon` small and stable under the same encoding rules,
* in a high tension world, every faithful encoding inside a fixed family shows `DeltaS_carbon` staying large.

Q093 does not tell us which world we live in. It builds a clear scoreboard for:

* how well a carbon cycle model behaves,
* how consistent data and models are with each other,
* how serious different feedback patterns might be.

Other problems in the BlackHole collection can reuse this scoreboard when they need to talk about climate risks, tipping points, or long term paths for human societies.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the named problem and associated tension quantities.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding scientific or mathematical problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects in this page (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and experiment protocols) live at the Tension Universe effective layer.
* No TU core axioms, deep generative rules, or internal field constructions from raw data are specified here.
* Any mapping from observations or model outputs to effective states `m` in `M` belongs to the implementation layer and can vary between applications, as long as it respects the encoding constraints.

### Encoding and falsifiability

* The concrete encoding used on this page is identified in the header by `Encoding_key`.
* All weights, thresholds, libraries, and admissible parameter ranges are part of the finite encoding family associated with that key, as defined in the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.
* Experiments and falsification conditions only test the compatibility of that encoding family with observations and models. They do not test or refute the TU core itself.

### Charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
