## 0. Effective-layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this page is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the S-problem **Q033**, which concerns selection tension among quantum gravity candidate frameworks.
* We only define state spaces, observables, mismatch scores, tension functionals, counterfactual tension worlds, and experiment patterns that operate on observable summaries.
* We do not specify any underlying TU core axiom system, generative rules, or constructive mapping from raw data to internal TU fields. Those belong to deeper layers outside the scope of this entry.
* This document does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical selection question in Section 1, and it does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that any particular quantum gravity framework has been confirmed or ruled out.
* Rejecting or falsifying a specific encoding instance of Q033 at the effective layer is not the same as solving the canonical selection problem for quantum gravity.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q033 can be stated as follows.

There exist several broad frameworks that attempt to give a consistent quantum description of spacetime and gravity. Examples include:

* string theory and its extensions,
* loop quantum gravity (LQG) and spin foam models,
* asymptotic safety programs for gravity,
* causal dynamical triangulations and related lattice approaches,
* other discrete, emergent, or holographic proposals.

Each framework can, in principle, be extended in many directions and can be matched to low energy physics in different ways. Many of these frameworks can reproduce classical general relativity in appropriate limits and can be made compatible with standard model physics at some effective level.

The core selection question is:

> Given current and foreseeable observational, experimental, and theoretical constraints, can we identify one, or a sharply delimited subset of, quantum gravity framework(s) as the uniquely preferred description of nature, or are we forced into a long term landscape where several inequivalent frameworks remain viable and cannot be cleanly separated?

At the canonical level, this is a selection and discrimination problem among multiple high level theories. It is not a problem of constructing any one theory from scratch.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Empirically and conceptually, the status is:

* Multiple frameworks can be made compatible with general relativity in the classical limit and with low energy effective field theory in suitable regimes.
* Direct experimental access to Planck scale phenomena is extremely limited, so many selection criteria rely on indirect consistency arguments, cosmology, or structural unification.
* String theory has developed an extensive mathematical and phenomenological structure, including gauge or gravity duality, compactifications, and a large landscape of vacua.
* Loop quantum gravity has developed rigorous quantizations of certain gravitational degrees of freedom, and concrete models for discrete spectra of geometric operators.
* Asymptotic safety and lattice approaches provide nonperturbative paths to ultraviolet complete theories of gravity.
* No single framework has yet produced a decisive, widely accepted, quantitatively verified prediction that excludes all competitors.

The difficulty arises from a combination of:

* limited experimental reach,
* high dimensional theory spaces,
* flexibility in matching to low energy physics,
* and deep conceptual questions about spacetime, unitarity, and holography.

There is no accepted, canonical selection principle that yields a unique winner.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q033 has three roles.

1. It is the prototype **selection tension** problem for high level physical theories. Here, consistency_tension measures how well each candidate fits simultaneously:

   * known data,
   * theoretical consistency conditions,
   * and cross regime coherence across scales.

2. It serves as a bridge node between:

   * Q021 (foundations of quantum field theory and gravity),
   * Q031 and Q032 (effective field theory and thermodynamic behavior),
   * Q040 (black hole information constraints).

3. It provides a template for how to encode, at the effective layer, a multi framework tension problem, where we compare several competing theories against a shared constraint set rather than evaluating a single theory in isolation.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide conceptual or technical foundations that Q033 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q021 (BH_PHYS_QFT_FOUND_L3_021)
  Reason: provides the effective layer encoding of quantum field theory and renormalization that all candidate quantum gravity frameworks must respect.

* Q031 (BH_PHYS_EFT_GRAV_L3_031)
  Reason: defines the effective field theory of gravity and the regime where any candidate must reduce to general relativity plus corrections.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: formalizes thermodynamic and statistical constraints on quantum systems, needed to encode black hole thermodynamics and holographic hints.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: encodes information theoretic constraints from black hole physics that any candidate quantum gravity theory must satisfy.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q033 components or depend on its selection tension structure.

* Q034 (BH_PHYS_QG_PHASES_L3_034)
  Reason: uses Q033 selection tension components to study phase structure and transitions between different quantum gravity regimes.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: reuses the consistency_tension framework to compare how different quantum gravity candidates resolve or fail to resolve information paradoxes.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: leverages Q033 cross regime consistency tools to encode relations between information processing, thermodynamics, and spacetime microstructure.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: reuses multi framework selection templates to interpret AI internal representations as competing effective theories.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but do not directly depend on Q033 components.

* Q021 (BH_PHYS_QFT_FOUND_L3_021)
  Reason: both Q021 and Q033 address consistency_tension of theory spaces, but Q021 focuses on quantum field theory foundations rather than gravity.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: both involve competing microscopic mechanisms that try to explain macroscopic phenomena under strong consistency constraints.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: both deal with complex field dynamics where global constraints must be satisfied by strongly coupled degrees of freedom.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q033 to non physics problems that can reuse its components.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001)
  Reason: both encode selection among models using structured tension functionals on complex field data, such as spectral versus geometric constraints.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: imports Q033 style consistency_tension between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic information flow.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: uses Q033 multi framework selection template for competing interpretability models of neural networks.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the TU effective layer. We describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* finite reference libraries and fairness constraints at the encoding level.

We do not describe any hidden TU generative rules or constructions that produce internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 State space and candidate library

We assume the existence of a hybrid semantic state space

`M_QG`

with the following structure at the effective layer.

1. Finite candidate library

   There is a finite index set

   ```txt
   Library_QG = { c_1, c_2, ..., c_K }
   ```

   where each `c_k` denotes an effective quantum gravity framework label, for example `string_like_family`, `loop_like_family`, `asymptotic_safety`, `lattice_based_family`, `emergent_spacetime_family`.

   The library is fixed before any tension evaluation. Adding or removing entries is treated as a separate versioned update of this problem, not as a parameter choice made after seeing the data.

2. Finite reference envelope library

   There is also a finite set of reference envelopes

   ```txt
   Library_env = { e_1, e_2, ..., e_L }
   ```

   Each `e_l` encodes, at the effective layer, a bundle of constraints such as:

   * classical general relativity tests,
   * cosmological observations,
   * black hole thermodynamics,
   * quantum field theory consistency conditions,
   * and basic unitarity and causality requirements.

   These envelopes are fixed before tension evaluation and are versioned if they are changed.

3. Hybrid state space

   Each state `m` in `M_QG` is of the form

   ```txt
   m = (c, e, X)
   ```

   where:

   * `c` is a candidate label in `Library_QG`,
   * `e` is an envelope label in `Library_env`,
   * `X` is an effective summary of how the chosen candidate behaves under the constraints grouped in `e`.

   We do not specify how `X` is constructed from detailed calculations or data. We only assume `X` contains enough structured information to evaluate the observables defined below.

#### Semantics note

The semantics are hybrid:

* discrete components: candidate labels `c`, envelope labels `e`, and evaluation dimensions,
* continuous components: real valued mismatch scores and tension indicators attached to each `(c, e)` pair.

All aggregation in this entry uses finite sums over the discrete parts together with real valued summaries. No infinite limits enter the effective layer description.

### 3.2 Admissible encoding class and fairness

We introduce an admissible encoding class

```txt
Enc_Q033
```

consisting of all encodings for Q033 that satisfy the following effective layer constraints.

1. Shared observable set

   Each encoding in `Enc_Q033` uses the same finite set of evaluation dimensions

   ```txt
   D_QG = { d_local, d_cosmo, d_bh, d_uv, d_internal }
   ```

   where, for example:

   * `d_local`: local and solar system tests of gravity,
   * `d_cosmo`: cosmological background and structure formation,
   * `d_bh`: black hole thermodynamics and information related constraints,
   * `d_uv`: ultraviolet completion and renormalization behavior,
   * `d_internal`: internal consistency including anomalies, unitarity, and causality.

2. Weight vector constraints

   Each encoding in `Enc_Q033` uses a weight vector

   ```txt
   w = (w_local, w_cosmo, w_bh, w_uv, w_internal)
   ```

   with:

   ```txt
   w_d > 0               for all d in D_QG
   sum over d in D_QG of w_d = 1
   ```

   There is a fixed minimal weight `w_min > 0` such that `w_d >= w_min` for all `d`. This prevents any dimension from being silently ignored while still allowing different emphasis patterns.

3. Fairness rule

   The weight vector `w` and any normalization scales for the observables are chosen:

   * before inspecting the detailed scores of individual candidates,
   * by a procedure that depends only on high level considerations such as experimental precision and perceived importance of regimes.

   In particular:

   * `w` cannot depend on the specific candidate index `c`,
   * `w` cannot be adjusted on a per candidate basis after seeing results,
   * any change to `w` must be applied to the entire candidate library and recorded as a new encoding version inside `Enc_Q033`.

4. Finite aggregation

   All tension functionals defined below are finite sums over the finite sets `Library_QG`, `Library_env`, and `D_QG`. No limiting processes or suprema over infinite families are used in this entry. This prevents hiding divergences behind poorly defined limits at the effective layer.

### 3.3 Observables and mismatch functionals

For each state `m = (c, e, X)` in `M_QG`, each encoding in `Enc_Q033` provides well defined nonnegative mismatch values

```txt
DeltaS_QG(m; d) >= 0  for each d in D_QG.
```

The interpretation is:

* `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` measures how strongly candidate `c`, evaluated under envelope `e`, fails to satisfy the constraints assigned to dimension `d`.

We assume:

* `DeltaS_QG(m; d) = 0` indicates perfect agreement with the reference envelope for that dimension,
* larger values indicate stronger tension or inconsistency.

The quantities `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` are dimensionless effective mismatch indicators. They are not physical entropies or energies. They summarize, on a fixed scale, how far an encoded candidate departs from the constraints grouped in `d`.

### 3.4 Candidate level tension and library tension

For each state `m`, we define the candidate level tension as:

```txt
Tension_QG(m) = sum over d in D_QG of w_d * DeltaS_QG(m; d)
```

where `w` satisfies the fairness rules above.

For a fixed envelope `e`, we obtain for each candidate `c` a tension value

```txt
Tension_QG(c; e)
```

by evaluating `Tension_QG(m)` at a state `m` with that `(c, e)` pair.

For a given encoding and envelope, we can define:

* minimal tension among candidates

  ```txt
  T_min(e) = min over c in Library_QG of Tension_QG(c; e)
  ```

* second best tension

  ```txt
  T_second(e) = second smallest value of Tension_QG(c; e)
  ```

* selection gap

  ```txt
  Gap_select(e) = T_second(e) - T_min(e)
  ```

on the understanding that for `K < 2` candidates the selection gap is not defined.

These quantities are finite because the candidate library is finite. The scalar `Tension_QG` and the gaps are dimensionless tension scores. They are part of the TU tension scale rather than new physical observables.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may fail to admit well defined mismatch values. We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M_QG : DeltaS_QG(m; d) is undefined or not finite for some d in D_QG }
```

We then define the regular domain:

```txt
M_QG_reg = M_QG \ S_sing
```

and impose:

* All tension related statements in this entry are restricted to states in `M_QG_reg`.
* If a proposed experiment or encoding would require evaluating `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` for a state in `S_sing`, this is treated as out of domain for Q033, not as evidence for or against any candidate theory.

This prevents apparent divergences or ill defined cases from being misinterpreted as physical selection signals.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

### 4.1 Core consistency_tension functional

At the effective layer, Q033 is governed by the following principle.

For each encoding in `Enc_Q033` and each envelope `e` in `Library_env`, we can compute `Tension_QG(c; e)` for all candidates `c` in `Library_QG`. The consistency_tension structure is given by:

* the distribution of `Tension_QG(c; e)` across candidates,
* the selection gaps `Gap_select(e)`,
* and how these quantities behave across different envelopes and encoding versions.

We can summarize the selection situation for a given encoding and envelope by the tension profile

```txt
Sigma_QG(e) = { Tension_QG(c; e) for all c in Library_QG }
```

together with `Gap_select(e)` when defined.

`Tension_QG` and `Gap_select` are effective-layer selection indicators. They provide a structured language for reading how clearly, or unclearly, the current data and constraints favor particular candidates.

### 4.2 Low selection tension regime

A low selection tension regime is characterized by:

1. Existence of a robustly best candidate

   There exists a candidate `c_star` such that, for a wide range of envelopes `e` in `Library_env` and admissible encodings in `Enc_Q033`,

   ```txt
   Tension_QG(c_star; e) is close to T_min(e)
   Gap_select(e) is bounded below by some gamma_QG > 0
   ```

   where `gamma_QG` does not shrink to zero under modest changes of weights and normalization within the fairness rules.

2. Cross envelope coherence

   The identity of `c_star` does not change when moving across envelopes that represent qualitatively different regimes, such as local tests, black hole constraints, and cosmology, except possibly in domains where the data are explicitly declared incomplete.

3. Stability under encoding refinements

   When encodings are refined in ways that add resolution but preserve the observable set and fairness rules, the tension values and selection gaps move within controlled bands and do not exhibit large scale reordering of the candidate ranking.

### 4.3 High selection tension (landscape) regime

A high selection tension regime is characterized by one or more of:

1. Persistent near degeneracy

   For many envelopes `e` and admissible encodings, `Gap_select(e)` remains very small so that different candidates can trade places as the best option under small, fairness allowed changes in weights or normalization.

2. Regime dependent winners

   Different envelopes favor different candidates in a way that cannot be reconciled with a single robust `c_star`. For example, one framework may perform best under local tests while another performs best under black hole constraints, with no consistent winner across all.

3. Sensitivity to encoding details

   Small changes within the fairness allowed variations of the encoding can substantially reorder the ranking of candidates, indicating that no candidate has a robust tension advantage.

In such a regime, selection remains ambiguous at the effective layer. The problem functions more like a structural landscape question than a sharp selection.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe three counterfactual worlds, strictly at the effective layer:

* World S: sharp selection world,
* World L: landscape world,
* World M: mixed emergent world.

These are patterns of behavior for the tension indicators. They are not microscopic theories and they are not ontological claims about what the universe is made of.

### 5.1 World S (sharp selection)

World S is defined by the following effective layer pattern.

1. Unique robust candidate

   There exists a candidate `c_star` such that, for all envelopes `e` in `Library_env` and all encodings in `Enc_Q033` that satisfy the fairness rules,

   ```txt
   Tension_QG(c_star; e) <= Tension_QG(c; e) - gamma_QG
   ```

   for all other candidates `c` and some fixed `gamma_QG > 0`.

2. Cross regime agreement

   The same `c_star` minimizes tension in local tests, cosmology, black hole constraints, and ultraviolet behavior, up to small, controlled variability determined by experimental uncertainties and modeling choices.

3. Encodings converge

   As encodings are refined by including more accurate data and better envelope modeling, the selection gaps remain stable or grow. The advantage of `c_star` is confirmed rather than eroded.

In this world, Q033 is effectively resolved toward a single winner at the effective layer.

### 5.2 World L (landscape)

World L is defined by persistent selection ambiguity.

1. Candidate near ties

   For many envelopes `e`, two or more candidates satisfy

   ```txt
   |Tension_QG(c_i; e) - Tension_QG(c_j; e)| <= epsilon_QG
   ```

   for small `epsilon_QG`, and small allowed changes of the encoding easily swap their ranking.

2. Regime fragmentation

   Some envelopes favor one candidate, others favor another, without any candidate maintaining an advantage across all major regimes. There is no stable `c_star` that dominates under all constraints.

3. Refinement does not resolve choices

   As data become more precise and modeling improves, the selection ambiguity does not disappear. In some cases the library tension picture becomes more complex instead of simpler.

In this world, Q033 remains an open landscape problem even at very high effective detail.

### 5.3 World M (mixed emergent)

World M describes a situation where no single candidate library entry is sufficient, but low tension is achieved by emergent combinations.

1. Patchwork low tension

   For different envelopes, different candidates minimize tension, but a patchwork of effective descriptions can be combined to yield low global tension if one allows context dependent use of frameworks.

2. Composite effective description

   There is no single microscopic theory in `Library_QG` with minimal tension everywhere. Instead, combined use of several candidates together with effective coarse graining rules yields the lowest achievable tension.

3. Selection problem shifts

   In this world, Q033 is not resolved by naming one winner. Instead, the selection problem shifts toward understanding how different frameworks should be combined and what higher level principles control the patchwork.

These worlds are conceptual tools for reading the tension patterns. They do not assert any specific microscopic ontology and they do not claim that the actual universe must realize one of them exactly.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q033 encoding,
* discriminate between different tension encodings within `Enc_Q033`,
* and provide evidence about whether we are in a sharp selection or a landscape regime.

They do not prove or disprove any particular candidate quantum gravity theory.

### Experiment 1: Cross regime tension profiling

*Goal*
Test whether the Q033 tension encoding can produce stable, interpretable selection gaps across a realistic set of envelopes.

*Setup*

* Choose a concrete finite subset of `Library_QG` and `Library_env` that reflects

  * local gravity tests,
  * cosmological data,
  * black hole related constraints,
  * ultraviolet completion considerations.

* For each pair `(c, e)`, build an effective state `m = (c, e, X)` in `M_QG_reg` that summarizes the candidate behavior under the envelope constraints.

* Use a fixed encoding in `Enc_Q033` with a specified weight vector `w` satisfying the fairness rules.

*Protocol*

1. For each `m = (c, e, X)`, evaluate `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` for all `d` in `D_QG`.
2. Compute `Tension_QG(c; e)` and derive `T_min(e)`, `T_second(e)`, and `Gap_select(e)` where applicable.
3. Repeat the evaluation under a small set of alternative encodings in `Enc_Q033`, for example by slightly varying `w` within the allowed fairness bounds.
4. Record how the ranking of candidates and selection gaps vary across envelopes and encodings.

*Metrics*

* For each envelope `e`, the mean and variance of `Tension_QG(c; e)` across candidate and encoding choices.
* The minimal and maximal values of `Gap_select(e)` across encodings.
* A qualitative classification into:

  * sharp selection, large and stable gaps,
  * weak preference, small gaps and modest stability,
  * no clear selection, gaps near zero and unstable.

*Falsification conditions*

* If under all admissible encodings the mismatch values or tensions cannot be defined on a substantial portion of `M_QG` without entering `S_sing`, then the current observable design or encoding is considered invalid for Q033 at the effective layer.
* If tiny, fairness allowed changes of weights lead to very large changes in candidate ranking, the encoding is treated as unstable and rejected at the effective layer.

*Domain boundary note*
Any case where the evaluation of `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` or `Tension_QG(m)` would require leaving `M_QG_reg` and entering `S_sing` is treated as out of domain for Q033. Such cases are not interpreted as evidence for or against any candidate theory.

*Semantics implementation note*
The hybrid nature of `M_QG` means candidate indices are discrete and observables are real valued. The experiment uses only finite sums over candidates, envelopes, and dimensions, which is consistent with the hybrid semantics declared in the metadata.

*Boundary note*
Falsifying a specific TU encoding instance within `Enc_Q033` does not solve the canonical selection problem in Section 1.

---

### Experiment 2: Model world discrimination with simplified toy frameworks

*Goal*
Check whether the Q033 encoding can reliably distinguish between toy frameworks that emulate key features of sharp selection and landscape worlds.

*Setup*

* Construct simplified toy models that play the role of candidate frameworks:

  * Family S: toy candidates designed so that one member clearly satisfies all constraints better than others across envelopes.
  * Family L: toy candidates constructed such that several members can be made nearly indistinguishable in performance across constraints.

* For each toy candidate and envelope, construct states `m` in `M_QG_reg` with well defined mismatch values `DeltaS_QG(m; d)`.

*Protocol*

1. Evaluate `Tension_QG(c; e)` and `Gap_select(e)` for all toy candidates and envelopes using a fixed encoding in `Enc_Q033`.
2. Check whether Family S realizations are classified as sharp selection cases, with large and stable gaps, and Family L realizations as landscape cases, with small and unstable gaps.
3. Repeat the procedure for several plausible choices of weights and envelope definitions within the fairness rules.

*Metrics*

* Frequency with which toy sharp selection worlds are correctly identified as sharp.
* Frequency with which toy landscape worlds are correctly identified as landscape.
* Sensitivity of classification to encoding choices that remain inside `Enc_Q033`.

*Falsification conditions*

* If the encoding consistently misclassifies toy worlds, for example labeling sharp selection toys as landscape or the reverse, under reasonable parameter ranges, then the current tension design is rejected for Q033.
* If misclassification can only be corrected by breaking the fairness rules, for example by tuning weights differently for each candidate, the encoding is considered untrustworthy at the effective layer.

*Domain boundary note*
Any toy configuration that forces states into `S_sing` rather than `M_QG_reg` is treated as outside the domain of Q033. Such configurations are used to refine the design of observables and encodings, not as evidence for or against real candidate theories.

*Semantics implementation note*
Toy frameworks are evaluated using the same finite observable set and aggregation rules as real candidates. This keeps the semantics consistent and prevents hidden complexity from entering only at the toy level.

*Boundary note*
Falsifying a TU encoding on toy models does not prove or disprove any real quantum gravity framework and does not by itself resolve Q033.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q033 can be instantiated as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, still at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used in AI models to encourage structured reasoning about quantum gravity selection.

All signals described here are built only from effective summaries such as `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` and `Tension_QG(c; e)`. They do not require access to any TU core generative rule.

1. `signal_qg_tension_profile`

   * Definition: vector valued signal whose components are the normalized `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` values over `d` in `D_QG`.
   * Purpose: expose to the model how each candidate performs along different constraint dimensions when reasoning about quantum gravity.

2. `signal_qg_selection_gap`

   * Definition: scalar signal equal to `Gap_select(e)` for the current envelope, when at least two candidates are available.
   * Purpose: indicate how sharp or ambiguous the selection is in the current regime.

3. `signal_qg_consistency_penalty`

   * Definition: penalty proportional to `Tension_QG(c; e)` for the candidate implicitly favored in the model internal representation.
   * Purpose: discourage reasoning paths that implicitly pick high tension frameworks without acknowledging their weaknesses.

4. `signal_qg_world_mode`

   * Definition: discrete or soft label indicating whether the current scenario is being treated as World S, World L, or World M for the sake of a thought experiment.
   * Purpose: help the model separate reasoning under different global assumptions instead of mixing them incoherently.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q033 structures without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `QG_Candidate_Head`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a physical context, such as a passage about quantum gravity, predict a distribution over candidate labels in `Library_QG` together with an estimated tension profile `(DeltaS_QG(m; d))`.
   * Interface: inputs are embeddings of the context; outputs are candidate probabilities and mismatch estimates per dimension.

2. `QG_Selection_Evaluator`

   * Role: compute `Tension_QG(c; e)` and `Gap_select(e)` at the effective layer for a chosen envelope, using the outputs of the candidate head.
   * Interface: provides scalar scores usable by training or inference time filters.

3. `TU_QG_Observer`

   * Role: generic observer that can be attached to complex reasoning chains, extracting simplified Q033 relevant summaries without changing underlying model weights.
   * Interface: yields logging information such as profiles over `D_QG` and approximate world mode classification, S, L, or M, for diagnostics.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q033 modules.

1. Task design

   * Collect a suite of questions and prompts about quantum gravity frameworks, selection principles, and landscape versus unique theory debates.

2. Baseline condition

   * The AI model answers questions without explicit use of Q033 modules, only using its general knowledge.

3. TU enhanced condition

   * The AI model answers the same questions but is instructed to

     * expose a candidate distribution over `Library_QG`,
     * estimate mismatch components per dimension,
     * consider selection gaps when drawing conclusions.

4. Metrics

   * Consistency of reasoning across related prompts, such as whether the same framework is implicitly favored in logically similar scenarios.
   * Clarity in distinguishing World S versus World L style reasoning when questions explicitly ask for both possibilities.
   * Reduction of informal contradictions about how many theories remain viable and for which reasons.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience Q033 style reasoning in an AI system.

*Baseline step*

* Prompt the AI with

  * a short summary of several quantum gravity frameworks,
  * and a question about whether current evidence strongly favors one of them.

* Observe whether the answer

  * mixes arguments without structure,
  * or jumps between a unique winner story and a landscape story without clear criteria.

*TU encoded step*

* Repeat the question but instruct the AI to

  * list candidates in `Library_QG`,
  * describe the constraints grouped into `D_QG`,
  * report qualitative mismatch levels per dimension,
  * and explicitly state whether the pattern looks more like World S, World L, or World M.

*Comparison metric*

* Evaluate whether the TU encoded answer

  * separates constraint dimensions more clearly,
  * states explicit selection gaps or the lack of such gaps,
  * makes the underlying ambiguity or preference more transparent.

This protocol can be implemented quickly and logged without revealing any internal TU generative mechanism.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective layer structure for candidate and envelope libraries, mismatch observables, and selection tensions is specified.
  * Fairness rules and finite aggregation constraints are explicitly stated in the definition of `Enc_Q033`.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative of sharp selection versus landscape versus mixed emergent worlds is clearly formulated at a conceptual level.
  * Concrete numerical instantiations with realistic data are still largely schematic.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented:

1. A working prototype that

   * instantiates a finite `Library_QG` and `Library_env`,
   * computes approximate `DeltaS_QG(m; d)` using published constraints,
   * and publishes tension profiles and selection gaps for different encoding choices inside `Enc_Q033`.

2. A toy model study that

   * uses simplified candidate and envelope models,
   * demonstrates clear discrimination between toy sharp selection and landscape worlds under the Q033 encoding,
   * and makes all code and data publicly available for independent checks.

Both routes stay within the effective layer because they operate only on observable summaries and do not expose any TU core generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q033 is expected to serve as:

* the canonical prototype for multi framework selection tension problems in physics,
* a staging ground for designing more refined selection principles that may eventually interact with experimental programs,
* and a bridge from high level theoretical debates about quantum gravity to AI and information theory problems that share the same multi framework structure.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

In everyday language, Q033 is about the following situation.

Physicists have several big ideas for how spacetime and gravity might work when quantum effects are fully taken into account. String theory is one of them, loop quantum gravity is another, and there are several more. Each idea has its own strengths, weaknesses, and open questions.

The hard question is not only how to write down one such theory in detail. The hard question is how to decide which, if any, matches our universe best, given that

* experiments cannot directly reach the very tiny scales where these theories differ most,
* many different versions of each theory are possible,
* and it is easy to adjust details to avoid simple contradictions.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not claim to solve this selection problem. Instead, we build a careful bookkeeping system at the effective layer.

* We list a finite set of candidate frameworks.
* We list a finite set of constraint bundles, such as local tests, cosmology, black holes, ultraviolet behavior, and internal consistency.
* For each pair, we imagine a state that summarizes how that candidate behaves under that bundle of constraints.

Then we define mismatch scores that say, in plain numbers, how much trouble each candidate has with each kind of constraint. By combining these scores in a fair way we get, for each candidate and each bundle, a tension value and a measure of how clearly one candidate beats the others.

If one candidate is consistently better across all bundles, with a clear margin that is stable under reasonable changes of weights, we call that a sharp selection world. If several candidates remain close together and the ranking changes easily, we call that a landscape world. If different candidates work best in different situations and we need to combine them, we call that a mixed emergent world.

This framework does not tell us which of these three patterns our universe actually follows. It does not prove any theory right or wrong. What it does is

* make the selection problem precise in terms of observable summaries,
* enforce explicit fairness and avoid hidden parameter tuning,
* and provide reusable tools for other problems where we must choose among several big frameworks that all claim to describe the same reality.

Q033 is therefore the reference template for “string theory versus alternatives” seen as a structured tension problem at the effective layer, not as a popularity contest.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the named problem **Q033**.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved or that any specific quantum gravity framework has been confirmed or ruled out.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here, including state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”, and experiment patterns, live at the Tension Universe effective layer.
* No TU core axiom system, semantic generator, or microscopic evolution rule is specified or relied upon in this file.
* No direct mapping from raw experimental or observational data to TU internal fields is given here. We only assume that such mappings exist and are handled at the project level.

### Encoding and fairness

* All references to encodings, weights, and aggregation rules are subject to the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter**.
* Changing weights or normalization schemes without updating the encoding version and applying the change to the full candidate library is considered out of scope for this document.
* Falsifying a particular encoding instance of Q033 does not falsify the Tension Universe program as a whole and does not solve the canonical selection problem.

### Tension scale

* Tension values and mismatch indicators such as `DeltaS_QG` and `Tension_QG` are dimensionless summary quantities. They are not physical entropies, energies, or probabilities.
* Thresholds for low, near critical, and high tension regimes are set by convention within the **TU Tension Scale Charter** and may evolve as the program matures.
