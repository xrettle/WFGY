## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements on this page live strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal is to specify an effective layer encoding of the global regularity and singularity questions for geometric flows in higher dimensions.
* The page does not claim to prove or disprove any specific global regularity conjecture, singularity classification, or existence result for any geometric flow.
* No new theorem is asserted beyond what is already present in the cited mathematical literature. Canonical open problems remain open.
* The state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual “worlds” described here are engineering constructs inside TU. They are not claims about any unique underlying ontology of mathematics, physics, or reality.
* Labels such as “low tension”, “high tension”, “good encoding”, or “bad encoding” refer only to how well a particular effective encoding fits the chosen admissible class and fairness constraints. They are not mathematical truth values.
* All falsifiability statements in later sections concern the TU encoding itself. Refuting an encoding at the effective layer does not refute any standard conjecture in geometric analysis.

With these boundaries, Q017 should be read as a structured way to encode and stress test how geometric flow regularity versus singularity can be organised in TU, not as an attempted solution of the underlying S level problem.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Geometric flows are evolution equations for geometric data on manifolds. Typical examples include:

* Ricci flow, where a time dependent Riemannian metric `g(t)` evolves according to a curvature driven equation.
* Mean curvature flow, where a family of hypersurfaces or submanifolds moves in the normal direction with speed equal to mean curvature.
* Other flows such as Yamabe flow, harmonic map flow, and related geometric evolution equations.

The global regularity question, in a simplified form, is:

> Given a geometric flow (for example Ricci flow or mean curvature flow) on a smooth manifold in dimension greater than or equal to some critical dimension, and given initial data that satisfies natural curvature or geometric conditions, does the flow remain smooth for all time, or must it develop singularities in finite time?

Concrete conjectural statements typically take one of the following forms.

1. Under appropriate curvature pinching assumptions and topological constraints, certain geometric flows on high dimensional manifolds exist for all time with uniformly controlled curvature.
2. When finite time singularities are known to form, one asks whether all such singularities can be classified and resolved in a controlled way, so that a suitable notion of weak or continued flow exists globally without uncontrolled blowup.

Q017 does not fix a single formal conjecture. It encodes the family of global regularity and singularity classification questions for higher dimensional geometric flows as a single S level tension node.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Several important cases of geometric flow regularity and singularity formation are understood in lower dimensions or under strong symmetry assumptions. Examples include:

* Ricci flow in three dimensions with suitable curvature assumptions, where singularity formation and surgery have been analysed in depth.
* Mean curvature flow for convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, where singularities are controlled and classified in many settings.
* Various partial results on higher dimensional flows under strong pinching or positivity conditions.

In general high dimensional settings:

* There is no complete classification of possible singularity types for many flows.
* It is unknown whether certain natural curvature conditions are sufficient to guarantee global regularity.
* It is unclear to what extent surgery or weak continuation procedures yield canonical global flows in all relevant situations.

The difficulty is both analytic and geometric. Flows can create complicated local structures at small scales while global topology and curvature interact in subtle ways. The problem is widely regarded as very challenging and is connected to deep questions about the structure of manifolds and nonlinear partial differential equations.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q017 is positioned as:

1. A prototype of a dynamical_field problem in geometry, where fields are metrics or embeddings that evolve in time under curvature driven equations.
2. A test case for encoding the tension between local smoothing tendencies of geometric flows and global obstructions or singularity formation in high dimensions, treated as a consistency_tension problem in TU.
3. A bridge between:

   * pure geometric analysis questions about flows and regularity, and
   * applied flow problems in physics, turbulence, and geophysical systems,

   via reusable descriptors of flow regularity and singularity tension.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q017 sits inside the BlackHole graph, using only Q identifiers and one line reasons that refer to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide foundations or tools that Q017 reuses at the effective layer.

* Q010 (BH_MATH_4D_SMOOTH_POINCARE_L3_010)
  Reason: supplies prototypes of smooth structures and topological constraints that interact with geometric flows in near critical dimensions.

* Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016)

* Q020 (BH_MATH_GEOM_HIGH_D_L3_020)
  Reason: encodes curvature constrained manifold classification frameworks in high dimensions that share invariants with the geometric flow descriptors used in Q017.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q017 components or depend on its flow based tension structures.

* Q020 (BH_MATH_GEOM_HIGH_D_L3_020)

  Reason: reuses Q017 flow regularity descriptors to characterise long time behaviour and mixing efficiency in ocean circulation models.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q011 (BH_MATH_NAVIER_STOKES_L3_011)
  Reason: both study evolution equations with potential finite time singularity, framed as tension between local smoothing and global blowup.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_TURBULENCE_FOUNDATIONS_L3_039)
  Reason: both involve multiscale evolution of fields with complex singular structures and consistency_tension between model assumptions and observed behaviour.

* Q020 (BH_MATH_GEOM_HIGH_D_L3_020)
  Reason: shares curvature based invariants and structural descriptors but focuses on static classification instead of flow evolution.

* Q094 (BH_EARTH_OCEAN_MIXING_L3_094)
  Reason: deep ocean circulation can be modelled as flows on curved domains, where Q017 style geometric flow descriptors characterise mixing and singular structures.

* Q100 (BH_SOC_SYSTEMIC_INSTABILITY_L3_100)
  Reason: uses the idea of flows on complex state spaces where singular regions signal structural instability, analogous to geometric singularities in Q017.

* Q105 (BH_SOC_CRASH_PREDICTION_L3_105)
  Reason: reuses the notion that sudden blowup of tension in flows on state spaces indicates systemic failure, by analogy with finite time singularities.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block remains at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any deep TU generative rules or any mapping from raw geometric data to internal TU fields.

### 3.0 Encoding class summary

Q017 works inside a fixed admissible encoding class `E_adm` with these properties.

* A finite library of flow types and curvature conditions is fixed in advance.
* Reference patterns for regularity and for monotone or entropy functionals are fixed based on existing well understood examples.
* A multiscale refinement scheme is fixed before any experiment. Refinement increases resolution but does not change reference patterns.
* Weights and rescaling functions that produce tension scores are chosen once per encoding class. They are not tuned per individual example.

Within `E_adm`, “low tension” and “high tension” are relative to these fixed choices. They measure how well a state fits the reference patterns and fairness constraints. They do not express any deeper metaphysical or mathematical claim beyond this encoding.

### 3.1 State space

We assume an effective state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation.

Each state `m` in `M` represents a coherent configuration of:

* a smooth manifold up to coarse equivalence, with specified dimension and basic topological type,
* a chosen geometric flow from a finite library of flow types,
* a finite time window `[t_start, t_end]` together with coarse information about flow behaviour within this window.

We introduce a finite library of geometric flow types:

```txt
L_flow = { Ricci_flow, Mean_curvature_flow, Yamabe_flow, Harmonic_map_flow }
```

and a finite library of curvature and geometric conditions:

```txt
L_cond = { C1, C2, ..., Ck }
```

Each `Ci` is a predicate on the geometric data encoded in `m`, representing conditions such as:

* bounded sectional curvature,
* nonnegative Ricci curvature,
* pinching inequalities,
* volume or injectivity radius bounds.

The details of how `M`, `L_flow`, and `L_cond` are constructed from raw mathematical objects are not specified. It is only required that for each relevant geometric example there exist states `m` that encode its flow and conditions consistently.

### 3.2 Effective observables

We define the following observables on `M`.

1. Curvature profile observable

```txt
curvature_profile(m; t, R_space)
```

* Input: state `m`, a time stamp `t` in the encoded time window, and a spatial region descriptor `R_space` on the manifold.
* Output: an effective vector of curvature summaries on `R_space` at time `t`, such as sup norms and Lp norms of curvature tensors.
* It is assumed to be finite and well defined for all `m` in a regular subset of `M`.

2. Injectivity profile observable

```txt
injectivity_profile(m; t, R_space)
```

* Input: state `m`, time `t`, and region `R_space`.
* Output: coarse lower bounds on injectivity radius or related noncollapsing measures on `R_space` at time `t`.

3. Flow time extent observable

```txt
flow_time_extent(m)
```

* Input: state `m`.
* Output: an effective summary of the maximal time interval on which the encoded flow is defined within the encoding. For example a finite or infinite time length.

4. Monotone functional observable

```txt
monotone_functional(m; t)
```

* Input: state `m` and time `t`.
* Output: the value of a chosen monotone or entropy like quantity associated with the flow at time `t`, whenever such a functional is defined for the flow type and conditions in `m`.

### 3.3 Regularity mismatch and tension quantities

We introduce a refinement parameter `k` that indexes admissible discretisation and resolution levels. For each `k` in a fixed countable index set `K`, we consider:

* a discrete set of times `T_k` inside the encoded time window,
* a discrete family of spatial regions `R_space_k` that cover the manifold at a controlled scale.

For each state `m` in `M`, and each refinement level `k`, we define a regularity mismatch observable:

```txt
DeltaS_reg(m; k)
```

which is a nonnegative scalar that measures inconsistency between:

* the regularising behaviour expected from the flow type in `L_flow` and conditions in `L_cond`, and
* the observed evolution of curvature_profile and injectivity_profile across times in `T_k` and regions in `R_space_k`.

We require

```txt
DeltaS_reg(m; k) >= 0  for all m, k
```

and declare that `DeltaS_reg(m; k) = 0` when all observed curvature and injectivity profiles at scale `k` match a chosen reference pattern for globally regular flows under the given flow type and conditions.

We also define a deviation of the monotone functional:

```txt
DeltaS_mono(m; k) >= 0
```

which measures discrepancies between the observed behaviour of `monotone_functional(m; t)` at sampling times in `T_k` and the behaviour expected from known monotonicity or entropy properties under the assumed conditions.

We then define a flow tension score at refinement level `k`:

```txt
Tension_flow(m; k) = alpha * DeltaS_reg(m; k) + beta * DeltaS_mono(m; k)
```

with fixed positive weights `alpha` and `beta` that satisfy

```txt
alpha > 0
beta > 0
alpha + beta = 1
```

The weights `(alpha, beta)` are chosen once for the encoding and are not adjusted per instance or after inspecting the data. This is part of the fairness constraint of `E_adm`.

### 3.4 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

To avoid encoding choices that hide inconsistencies or reconstruct desired conclusions, we fix an admissible encoding class `E_adm` with the following properties.

* The finite libraries `L_flow` and `L_cond` are fixed before any experiment.
* For each flow type and condition combination in `L_flow` and `L_cond`, a reference family of regularity profiles and monotone functional behaviours is fixed in advance, based on existing theory and well understood low dimensional cases.
* The refinement scheme `(K, T_k, R_space_k)` is fixed in advance. Refinement only increases resolution and does not change underlying reference patterns.
* The weights `alpha` and `beta` and any rescaling factors used later are fixed for all states and are not retuned based on outcomes for individual cases.

Within `E_adm`, the pair of functions `DeltaS_reg` and `DeltaS_mono` and the resulting `Tension_flow` must be defined in a way that respects these fixed choices. Low tension or high tension assessments should not depend on hidden parameter tuning per example.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restriction

Some states may contain incomplete or inconsistent information about curvature or flow behaviour, which makes it impossible to evaluate regularity mismatch or tension in a meaningful way. We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = { m in M : for some k in K, DeltaS_reg(m; k) or DeltaS_mono(m; k) is undefined or not finite }
```

and the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All Q017 tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg`. When an experiment samples a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain for Q017 at the effective layer. Such out of domain cases do not count as evidence about the underlying global regularity problem. They can however be used to detect failures or gaps in the encoding.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q017 is encoded as a tension problem in TU, without asserting any proof of global regularity or singularity classification.

### 4.1 Core flow tension functional

Given the refinement indexed tension scores `Tension_flow(m; k)`, we define an aggregated flow tension functional

```txt
Tension_flow_global(m) = sup over k in K of G_k(Tension_flow(m; k))
```

where each `G_k` is a fixed nondecreasing function that rescales the tension at level `k` into a common band, for example

```txt
G_k(x) = min(1, c_k * x)
```

with positive scale factors `c_k`. The choice of `G_k` and `c_k` is fixed within the admissible encoding class `E_adm`.

Properties:

* `Tension_flow_global(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`.
* `Tension_flow_global(m)` is small when regularity mismatch and monotone functional deviations are small across all refinement levels.
* `Tension_flow_global(m)` becomes large when, at some refinement scale, the flow exhibits behaviour that is incompatible with the expected regularity patterns under the chosen flow type and conditions.

In this sense “low global tension” and “high global tension” are properties of the encoding and of the chosen observables. They do not by themselves certify or refute any rigorous theorem.

### 4.2 Global regularity as low tension stability

At the effective layer, the family of global regularity conjectures encoded by Q017 can be phrased in tension form.

> For flows in the library `L_flow` on manifolds satisfying conditions in `L_cond` in the dimension ranges of interest, there exist world representing states in `M_reg` such that the flow tension `Tension_flow_global` can be kept in a low band that is stable under refinement.

Formally, there should exist `epsilon_T > 0` and, for each admissible refinement level `k`, states `m_T(k)` in `M_reg` that represent the same underlying world and satisfy

```txt
Tension_flow(m_T(k); k) <= epsilon_T
```

with `epsilon_T` not growing without bound as `k` increases. This expresses that as we examine flows at higher resolution they do not develop hidden singularity patterns that violate the assumed regularity under the given conditions, at least within the encoding class.

### 4.3 Singular behaviour as persistent high tension

If the corresponding global regularity conjectures are false in some setting, then in any encoding within `E_adm` that remains faithful to the actual flows and manifolds, world representing states would eventually exhibit persistent high tension.

There should exist `delta_F > 0` such that one can find refinement levels `k_n` and associated states `m_F(k_n)` in `M_reg` with

```txt
Tension_flow(m_F(k_n); k_n) >= delta_F
```

for all `n`. The value `delta_F` should not be removable by refining the encoding while respecting the fixed libraries `L_flow`, `L_cond` and the refinement scheme. This indicates that singular behaviour is not an artefact of low resolution but a stable feature of the flow under the given conditions.

At the effective layer, Q017 is therefore a node that organises both low tension “regularity dominated” scenarios and high tension “singularity dominated” scenarios within a single framework. It does not assert which regime our world belongs to and it does not claim to know whether global regularity or unavoidable singularities hold in any given setting. The purpose is to make the competing possibilities auditable and comparable inside TU.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the level of observables and tension patterns.

* World T: a world where flows satisfying the conditions remain globally regular in the sense of low flow tension.
* World F: a world where flows satisfying the conditions exhibit unavoidable singularities and high flow tension.

No deep TU generative rules or constructions are given.

### 5.1 World T (global regularity, low flow tension)

In World T:

1. Curvature and injectivity patterns

   For each admissible flow and condition combination, world representing states `m_T(k)` exist such that curvature_profile and injectivity_profile remain within bands that are compatible with long time regularity at all refinement levels.

2. Monotone functional behaviour

   The monotone_functional observable in `m_T(k)` behaves in accordance with known or conjectured monotonicity and entropy properties, with `DeltaS_mono(m_T(k); k)` staying within a small band for all `k`.

3. Flow time extent

   The observable `flow_time_extent(m_T(k))` indicates that flows can be extended indefinitely, or up to the natural maximal time allowed by the context, without uncontrolled blowup in the encoded window.

4. Global tension band

   The global tension satisfies

   ```txt
   Tension_flow_global(m_T) <= epsilon_T
   ```

   for some small `epsilon_T` that does not depend on the refinement level.

### 5.2 World F (finite time singularities, high flow tension)

In World F:

1. Curvature concentration

   There exist flows and states `m_F(k)` representing them where curvature_profile exhibits concentration at certain times and regions that cannot be removed by scaling and that push `DeltaS_reg(m_F(k); k)` above a fixed positive threshold.

2. Injectivity collapse

   The injectivity_profile in some states shows collapse in finite time. This indicates neck formation or pinched regions that are not compatible with the regularity patterns used in the reference library.

3. Monotone functional anomalies

   The behaviour of monotone_functional in `m_F(k)` deviates in a persistent way from the patterns expected under the assumed flow type and conditions. This leads to `DeltaS_mono(m_F(k); k)` staying above a positive threshold for some refinement levels.

4. Global tension gap

   There exists `delta_F > 0` such that, for any attempt to encode these flows within `E_adm` without changing `L_flow`, `L_cond` or the refinement scheme,

   ```txt
   Tension_flow_global(m_F) >= delta_F
   ```

   and this gap cannot be closed by tuning parameters within the allowed encoding class.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not define or access any deep TU generative rules. They only describe how observable curvature, injectivity and monotone functional patterns, together with the flow tension encoding, would differ between a regularity dominated world and a singularity dominated world.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence and usefulness of the Q017 encoding,
* distinguish between different flow tension models within the admissible encoding class,
* expose unstable or uninformative choices of observables or weights.

These experiments cannot prove or disprove global regularity statements. They test only the behaviour of the encoding at the effective layer.

### Experiment 1: Library based flow regularity check

*Goal*
Check whether the Q017 encoding correctly distinguishes known regular flows from known singular flows, using only observables and tension scores.

*Setup*

Construct a finite library of model flows drawn from `L_flow` and `L_cond`.

* Set R: examples where global regularity or controlled behaviour is known, such as certain low dimensional Ricci flows and convex mean curvature flows.
* Set S: examples where finite time singularities are known and classified, such as neckpinch or type I singularities in mean curvature flow and Ricci flow.

For each example, collect or simulate data that is sufficient to define curvature_profile, injectivity_profile and monotone_functional at a set of refinement levels `k` in `K`.

*Protocol*

1. For each example in R and S, construct a state `m_R` or `m_S` in `M_reg` that encodes the relevant flow over a chosen time window.
2. For each chosen refinement level `k`, evaluate

   ```txt
   DeltaS_reg(m; k)
   DeltaS_mono(m; k)
   Tension_flow(m; k)
   ```

   for all `m` in R and S.
3. Compute the global tension `Tension_flow_global(m)` for each example.
4. Compare the distributions of `Tension_flow_global` over R and S.

*Metrics*

* Mean and variance of `Tension_flow_global` for R and S.
* The fraction of regular examples in R whose tension lies below a chosen threshold band.
* The fraction of singular examples in S whose tension lies above a chosen threshold band.
* Stability of these fractions as refinement levels and sampling choices vary within the predetermined scheme.

*Falsification conditions*

* If, across all reasonable choices of reference profiles and weights allowed by `E_adm`, the majority of known regular examples in R exhibit higher `Tension_flow_global` than singular examples in S, the encoding is considered misaligned and rejected.
* If small perturbations of encoding parameters within `E_adm` lead to uncontrolled fluctuations in which examples are low tension or high tension, with no consistent pattern aligned to regular versus singular behaviour, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.

*Semantics implementation note*
All observables and tension scores in this experiment are interpreted within the same continuous field viewpoint fixed in the metadata. No discrete or hybrid semantics are introduced here.

*Boundary note*
Falsifying this encoding at the effective layer does not prove or disprove any canonical global regularity conjecture for geometric flows.

---

### Experiment 2: High dimensional numerical flow simulations

*Goal*
Test whether the Q017 encoding can detect emerging singularity patterns in high dimensional flows beyond well studied low dimensional cases, using numerical simulations.

*Setup*

* Select a set of high dimensional manifolds and initial data for flows in `L_flow` that satisfy conditions in `L_cond`.
* For each configuration, run numerical simulations of the flow over a time window that is large enough to include potential singularity events.
* At each refinement level `k` and at selected times, extract approximate curvature_profile, injectivity_profile and monotone_functional values.

*Protocol*

1. For each simulated flow, construct a state `m_sim(k)` in `M_reg` that encodes the approximate observables at refinement level `k`.
2. Compute `DeltaS_reg(m_sim(k); k)`, `DeltaS_mono(m_sim(k); k)` and `Tension_flow(m_sim(k); k)` for each `k`.
3. Track the evolution of `Tension_flow(m_sim(k); k)` as the flow evolves in time and as refinement level increases.
4. Identify flows where numerical evidence suggests singularity formation or failure of controlled regularity.

*Metrics*

* The correlation between growing `Tension_flow(m_sim(k); k)` and independent numerical indicators of singularity formation, such as rapidly increasing curvature norms.
* The fraction of flows where tension rises above a given threshold before or at the time numerical singularity indicators appear.
* The robustness of these patterns under variations in discretisation schemes and numerical parameters that remain within the same refinement class.

*Falsification conditions*

* If flows that are numerically observed to develop singularities do not produce any persistent increase in `Tension_flow(m_sim(k); k)` at any refinement level, the encoding is considered insensitive and rejected for such settings.
* If flows that are numerically smooth over the time window repeatedly trigger high tension bands that cannot be attributed to numerical artefacts, the encoding is considered poorly calibrated and requires revision.

*Semantics implementation note*
Numerical approximations are treated as noisy but consistent realisations of the same continuous observables defined for analytic flows. The encoding should be robust to such imperfections within the predetermined refinement and admissible encoding class.

*Boundary note*
Falsifying this encoding at the effective layer does not resolve any open global regularity problem for geometric flows.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q017 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, staying at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals derived from the Q017 observables and tension functionals.

1. `signal_flow_regularity_margin`

   Definition: a signal based on `DeltaS_reg(m; k)` and `Tension_flow(m; k)` across one or more refinement levels.
   Purpose: penalise internal representations that encode patterns typical of singular behaviour while predicting or claiming global regularity.

2. `signal_curvature_concentration`

   Definition: a signal extracted from curvature_profile that increases when curvature mass concentrates in small regions and short times.
   Purpose: provide an early warning signal for potential singularities or breakdown of regularity in model reasoning.

3. `signal_flow_scale_consistency`

   Definition: a signal that measures the consistency of flow behaviour across different refinement levels `k`, based on differences in `Tension_flow(m; k)`.
   Purpose: encourage the model to maintain coherent multiscale descriptions of flows rather than contradictory narratives at different resolutions.

4. `signal_world_T_vs_world_F_separation`

   Definition: a signal that rewards internal representations where hypothetical World T and World F scenarios for flows are clearly separated in tension space.
   Purpose: help the model keep assumptions about regularity or singularity regimes explicit and traceable.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q017 structures.

1. `GeometricFlowStateHead`

   Role: map internal representations of geometric flow problems into a compact descriptor that is compatible with the Q017 observables.
   Interface: takes hidden states from a reasoning model and outputs approximate curvature_profile, injectivity_profile and monotone_functional summaries.

2. `FlowRegularityTensionHead`

   Role: compute `DeltaS_reg`, `DeltaS_mono` and `Tension_flow` from the GeometricFlowStateHead outputs.
   Interface: produce scalar tension scores and possibly a vector of decomposed mismatch components.

3. `FlowRegimeClassifier`

   Role: given tension scores and other features, classify scenarios as World T like, regularity dominated, or World F like, singularity dominated, at the effective layer.
   Interface: output probabilities or confidence scores that can be used to guide reasoning or explanation.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q017 modules.

1. Task selection

   Collect a set of problems and examples that involve geometric flows. Examples include:

   * explaining known regularity results in low dimensions,
   * describing singularity formation examples,
   * performing qualitative reasoning about high dimensional flows.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the model operates without any Q017 specific heads or training signals, relying only on general knowledge.
   * TU condition: the model includes GeometricFlowStateHead and FlowRegularityTensionHead, and uses the training signals from 7.1.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy on factual questions about flow behaviour and known theorems.
   * Consistency in distinguishing regular and singular examples in explanations.
   * Stability of reasoning about long time flow behaviour when problem descriptions are perturbed or refined.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This is a minimal external protocol to experience Q017 style encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  Prompt the AI: ask it to explain why geometric flows can sometimes smooth a manifold and sometimes develop singularities, and to give examples.
  Observe whether the explanation is disconnected, mixes up regular and singular cases, or misses key geometric patterns.

* TU encoded setup

  Prompt the same AI instance, but instruct it to use:

  * curvature and injectivity profiles,
  * time extent of flows,
  * explicit tension between expected regularity and observed singularities,

  as organising concepts in the explanation.

  Observe whether the explanation becomes more structured, clearly separates regularity regimes from singularity regimes, and uses consistent flow descriptors.

* Comparison metric

  Use a rubric that scores structure, correct use of flow examples and clarity in describing regularity versus singularity.
  Compare scores between baseline and TU conditions for several prompts.

* What to log

  Log prompts, responses and any internal tension scores or signals computed by Q017 style modules.
  This log allows later audit of how the encoding affects reasoning, without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

This protocol compares two effective layer behaviours of the same model. It does not claim that Q017 gives new mathematical insight about geometric flows. It is a way to test whether the encoding helps explanations behave in a more disciplined way.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q017 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

   Type: field

   Minimal interface:

   * Output: a fixed length vector of summary features representing curvature_profile, injectivity_profile and monotone functional behaviour over a chosen time window.

   Preconditions:

   * The input corresponds to a well defined geometric flow within `L_flow` and conditions within `L_cond`.

2. ComponentName: `FlowRegularity_TensionFunctional`

   Type: functional

   Minimal interface:

   * Inputs: outputs of `GeometricFlow_StateDescriptor` at one or more refinement levels.
   * Output: scalar values `DeltaS_reg`, `DeltaS_mono` and `Tension_flow_global`.

   Preconditions:

   * The refinement scheme and weights `(alpha, beta)` are fixed in advance.

3. ComponentName: `CounterfactualFlowWorld_Template`

   Type: experiment_pattern

   Minimal interface:

   * Inputs: a class of flows and conditions, plus a choice of which behaviours count as regular versus singular in the application.
   * Output: definitions of World T and World F scenarios, including observable patterns and associated tension thresholds.

   Preconditions:

   * The flows and conditions can be mapped to the Q017 observables and tension scores.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q011 (Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness)

   Reused components: `GeometricFlow_StateDescriptor` and `FlowRegularity_TensionFunctional`.
   Why it transfers: incompressible fluid velocity fields can be viewed as evolving geometric objects on domains. Regularity versus blowup tension can be expressed using similar descriptors.
   What changes: the underlying PDE and fields are different, but curvature like and regularity indicators are adapted to the Navier–Stokes setting.

2. Q039 (Fundamental theory of turbulence)

   Reused component: `CounterfactualFlowWorld_Template`.
   Why it transfers: turbulence involves flows with complex multiscale structures that can be framed as World T like, structured yet regular regimes, versus World F like, unstable and singular regimes.
   What changes: the observables correspond to energy spectra and cascade behaviour instead of geometric curvature, while tension interpretation follows a similar pattern.

3. Q094 (Deep ocean mixing and circulation)

   Reused component: `GeometricFlow_StateDescriptor`.
   Why it transfers: large scale ocean flows can be described as evolutions on curved domains. Q017 style descriptors capture regularity, mixing and potential singular structures.
   What changes: observables incorporate stratification, boundaries and rotation effects, while the interface remains a flow descriptor and tension functional.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q017 within the TU verification ladder and records next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  A coherent effective encoding for geometric flow regularity and singularity tension has been specified. Observables, tension functionals and a clear admissible encoding class `E_adm` are defined, with explicit fairness constraints on reference profiles and weights.

* N_level: N1

  The narrative that links state space, observables, tension scores and counterfactual worlds is explicit and internally consistent. At least one concrete experiment pattern with falsification conditions is available.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward higher E levels

To advance toward E2 and beyond, the following measurable steps are required.

1. Implementation of a concrete prototype that:

   * maps explicit geometric flow examples into `GeometricFlow_StateDescriptor`,
   * computes `Tension_flow(m; k)` and `Tension_flow_global(m)` for selected flows,
   * publishes tension profiles for a library of classical regular and singular examples.

2. Explicit fixation of:

   * the finite libraries `L_flow` and `L_cond` for Q017,
   * reference patterns for regularity and monotone functionals,
   * the refinement index set `K` and region families `R_space_k`,

   in a way that can be independently reproduced and audited.

3. Application of the Q017 encoding to at least one cross domain problem such as Q039 or Q094, with publicly documented examples that show how the flow descriptors and tension functionals transfer.

These steps can all be executed at the effective layer, without exposing deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the broader TU program, Q017 is expected to serve as:

* the central node for dynamical_field problems where evolution equations create or avoid singular structures,
* a template for how to encode global regularity versus blowup questions in a way that is audit friendly, falsifiable at the encoding level, and reusable for a wide range of flow systems in mathematics and physics.

As the BlackHole collection evolves, Q017 can be upgraded to higher E and N levels by hardening its finite libraries, refinement implementation and cross domain demonstrations.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block provides a non technical explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer description.

Many geometric problems can be phrased in three steps.

1. Start with a curved space, such as a manifold with a metric.
2. Let this geometry evolve according to a rule, for example letting curvature push the shape around over time.
3. Ask whether the evolution stays smooth forever, or whether it forms sharp features or singularities in finite time.

The global regularity question asks whether such flows behave well in the long run, especially in high dimensions where intuition is weaker and singularities can be complicated.

In the TU view, we do not try to solve these problems directly. Instead we do three things.

1. We describe each possible world in terms of observable quantities.

   * how large curvature becomes,
   * whether distances collapse in small regions,
   * how certain energy or entropy like quantities change over time.

2. We define a tension score.

   * low tension means the flow behaves as expected for a smooth evolution under the chosen conditions, within the chosen encoding,
   * high tension means the flow shows patterns that look like the start of singularities or breakdown of the expected behaviour.

3. We imagine two types of worlds.

   * a regularity dominated world where, as you look more closely and for longer times, flows under certain conditions always keep low tension,
   * a singularity dominated world where some flows show persistent high tension that signals true singular behaviour, not just numerical artefacts.

This does not prove whether flows in our universe are always regular or not. It does not settle any open conjecture. What it provides is:

* a precise way to talk about the evidence that comes from known examples and numerical simulations,
* a way to test whether a proposed encoding of flow behaviour is honest and stable,
* a set of tools that can be reused in other problems, such as turbulence or ocean circulation, where complex flows evolve on curved spaces.

Q017 is the node that collects all of this for geometric flows in higher dimensions. It acts as a reference point for any question that can be phrased as:

> Does this geometric flow stay smooth forever, or must it develop singularities, and how can we express that tension using observable quantities?

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The purpose of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* The page does not prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* The page does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* The page should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in geometric analysis has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects that appear here, including state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores and counterfactual “worlds”, live inside the effective layer of TU.
* They are tools for organising known theory, numerical evidence and hypothetical scenarios. They are not claims about any unique underlying structure of mathematics or physics.
* Low tension and high tension labels are properties of the chosen encoding and admissible class. They are not mathematical truth values and they do not replace rigorous proofs.

### Encoding and fairness

* The admissible encoding class `E_adm` for Q017 fixes in advance the libraries of flows and conditions, the refinement scheme and the rescaling functions that define tension scores.
* Parameters are not tuned per example after outcomes are known. This is intended to keep comparisons between different flows, and between World T like and World F like scenarios, auditable and fair.
* Experiments in Section 6 can refute specific encodings inside `E_adm`. Such refutations do not refute any standard conjecture or theorem in geometric analysis.
