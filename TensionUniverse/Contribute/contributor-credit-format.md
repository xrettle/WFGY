# Contributor Credit Format

This page defines the standard contributor credit block for Tension Universe MVP experiment pages.

The goal is simple:

- acknowledge meaningful work on a specific experiment page
- keep contributor credits consistent across the project
- avoid ownership confusion
- keep all public credit blocks clean and easy to review

## What contributor credit means

A contributor credit block acknowledges meaningful contribution to a specific MVP experiment page.

It does not mean:

- ownership of the Tension Universe project
- ownership of the overall WFGY direction
- authority over unrelated pages
- editorial control over the full experiment field

It is page-level acknowledgement only.

## Where contributor credit appears

If a contribution is accepted, the contributor credit block may appear at the bottom of the relevant experiment page.

Typical location:

- near the end of `TensionUniverse/Experiments/Qxxx_MVP/README.md`
- after the main experiment content
- after context or charter links, if those are present

The exact placement may be adjusted for formatting consistency.

## Allowed link types

For consistency and verification, contributor credit only accepts GitHub links.

Allowed:

- GitHub profile links
- GitHub repository links

Examples:

- `https://github.com/yourname`
- `https://github.com/yourname/your-repo`

Not accepted:

- personal websites
- X or Twitter links
- Discord handles
- Telegram links
- LinkedIn links
- email addresses
- non-GitHub social links

This keeps credit blocks simple, verifiable, and consistent with the project structure.

## Standard credit block

Use the following format:

## Contributor Credit

Name: YourName  
GitHub: https://github.com/yourname  
Reference Repo: https://github.com/yourname/your-repo

## Field rules

### Name

This is the public name attached to the page-level contribution.

It can be:

- a personal name
- a handle
- a project-facing identity

Keep it short and readable.

### GitHub

This should be the contributor's main GitHub profile.

It should point to a valid public GitHub account.

### Reference Repo

This is optional in spirit, but preferred when the contributor wants to show a directly relevant public repo.

It should be a GitHub repository link only.

If no relevant repository is provided, the maintainer may remove this line or leave only the profile line.

## Minimal version

If a shorter form is needed, the following minimal version may be used:

## Contributor Credit

Name: YourName  
GitHub: https://github.com/yourname

This shorter version is acceptable when no specific repository should be attached.

## Anonymous or low-profile credit

If a contributor wants acknowledgement without a repo link, a minimal low-profile version may be used:

## Contributor Credit

Name: Anonymous Contributor  
GitHub: https://github.com/yourname

If a contributor does not want a public GitHub link shown, the project may simply omit the contributor credit block entirely.

Public credit is optional, not mandatory.

## Editorial control

All contributor credit blocks may be adjusted by the maintainer for:

- formatting consistency
- line order
- naming clarity
- project-wide style alignment

This does not remove credit.
It keeps the presentation consistent across the experiment collection.

## Acceptance boundary

A contributor credit block should only be added when the contribution is meaningful enough to be accepted into the experiment page.

Small typo fixes, formatting-only edits, or minor cleanup changes do not automatically require a contributor credit block.

Credit is intended for real content contribution, not for every tiny edit.

## Recommended usage

The cleanest pattern is:

1. contribute or improve a specific MVP experiment page
2. get the page accepted
3. add the standard contributor credit block at the bottom of that page

This keeps attribution tied directly to the experiment page that was actually improved.

## Final note

Contributor credit exists to acknowledge real builders inside the experiment field.

It should stay:

- accurate
- modest
- page-specific
- easy to verify

That is the standard for this project.
