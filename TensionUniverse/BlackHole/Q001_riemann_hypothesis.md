## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Let zeta(s) be the Riemann zeta function, initially defined for complex s with real part greater than 1 by the convergent series

`zeta(s) = sum_{n=1 to infinity} 1 / n^s`

and extended to a meromorphic function on the complex plane with a single simple pole at `s = 1`.

The nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) are the zeros in the critical strip, meaning those zeros with real part strictly between 0 and 1.

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is the statement:

> Every nontrivial zero of zeta(s) has real part exactly `1/2`.

Equivalently, if `zeta(s) = 0` and the real part of s is strictly between 0 and 1, then `Re(s) = 1/2`.

This is a central open problem of analytic number theory and of modern mathematics as a whole.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

RH has remained open since Riemann's 1859 memoir. Partial results include:

* All nontrivial zeros lie in the critical strip (by the standard analytic continuation and functional equation framework).
* Infinitely many zeros lie on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.
* A positive proportion of zeros are known to lie on the critical line.
* Many deep theorems in prime number theory (for example about error terms in the prime number theorem) are equivalent to, or would follow from, RH.

No proof or disproof is known. The problem is widely believed to be extremely difficult and is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q001 plays three roles:

1. It is the root example of a spectral_tension problem, where analytic spectral data and arithmetic structure must cohere.
2. It anchors the family of L-function and number-theoretic spectral problems (Q002, Q003, Q015, Q018, Q019).
3. It provides a clean setting to test the Tension Universe encoding of:

   * spectral fields,
   * arithmetic observables,
   * tension functionals and counterfactual worlds.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q001 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge is listed with a one-line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or general foundations that Q001 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016)
  Reason: Provides foundational perspective on set theory and continuum structure that underlies the analytic_field used in the RH encoding.
* Q018 (BH_MATH_RANDOM_MATRIX_ZEROS_L3_018)
  Reason: Supplies the random matrix perspective used to define spectral_tension baselines for the zero distribution.
* Q019 (BH_MATH_DIOPH_DENSITY_L3_019)
  Reason: Encodes general frameworks for rational point distributions that parallel how prime distributions are linked to zeta zeros.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems are direct reuse targets of Q001 components or depend on Q001's tension structure.

* Q002 (BH_MATH_GRH_L3_002)
  Reason: Reuses the SpectralTensionScore_RH component as a template for L-function families.

  Reason: Uses zeta and L-function spectral tension to constrain ranks of elliptic curves.
* Q015 (BH_MATH_RANK_BOUNDS_L3_015)
  Reason: Depends on spectral_tension ideas to relate global L-function behavior to uniform rank bounds.
* Q018 (BH_MATH_RANDOM_MATRIX_ZEROS_L3_018)
  Reason: Uses Q001's spectral_tension functional as the reference object for comparing actual zero statistics with model ensembles.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component dependence.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Both Q001 and Q036 are governed by hidden spectral structures that must match macroscopic observables under spectral_tension.
* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: Both are governed by complex fields with intricate structure where global laws emerge from local spectral patterns.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q001 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Can reuse tension-style functionals on spectra to relate microscopic energy distributions to macroscopic thermodynamic behavior.
* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: Can reuse spectral_tension tools to study how field spectra encode information in black hole models.
* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses the notion of tension between spectral structure and information-theoretic observables.
* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Uses RH spectral_tension encoding as a model for interpreting internal AI representations as structured spectra.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

`M`

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent "zeta-world configuration" for the Riemann zeta function, consisting of:

  * local spectral data for zeta(s) in a bounded region of the critical strip,
  * local arithmetic data related to primes or prime powers in corresponding ranges,
  * coarse meta-information about the regularity of the spectral data.

We do not specify how these configurations are constructed from raw numerical computations or proofs. We only assume that:

* For any bounded region of interest R in the critical strip, there exist states m in M that encode the spectral and arithmetic summaries restricted to that R.

Minimal structure lock (to justify sup, refinement, and auditability):

* M is a set of states.
* Par is a subset of R^k for some finite k, and Par contains resolution parameters used by the encoding.
* Each observable defined below is a well-defined map on a restricted domain M_reg (defined in Block 3.5).
* For any "sup over a family of regions" used in this file, the family is required to be countable and parameterized by a declared resolution index. This removes any unbounded freedom from uncountable region selection.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective fields and observables on M_reg. To keep ASCII math strict, each observable is written as a map on a single combined input symbol.

1. Local spectral density observable

```txt
rho_zero(m_R) >= 0
```

* Input: m_R denotes a state m paired with a bounded region R in the critical strip.
* Output: an effective scalar quantity summarizing the density of nontrivial zeros in R as encoded in m.
* Interpretation: in RH-compatible worlds, rho_zero should be close to a pre-declared reference profile from an admissible reference class (locked below).

2. Local arithmetic profile observable

```txt
A_prime(m_I)
```

* Input: m_I denotes a state m paired with a positive interval I on the real line.
* Output: an effective vector or tuple summarizing prime distribution features on I, such as prime counting deviations or related summaries.
* Finite-value lock: A_prime(m_I) must be finite on M_reg by definition of M_reg.

3. Spectral mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0
```

* Meaning: deviation of the encoded zero distribution in R from a reference profile.
* Properties:

  * DeltaS_spec(m_R) >= 0
  * DeltaS_spec(m_R) = 0 if the encoded spectral summaries match the chosen reference profile on R within the declared tolerance model.

4. Arithmetic mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0
```

* Meaning: deviation of the encoded arithmetic profile on I from a reference prime profile.
* Properties:

  * DeltaS_arith(m_I) >= 0
  * DeltaS_arith(m_I) = 0 if the encoded arithmetic summaries match the chosen reference profile on I within the declared tolerance model.

5. Combined RH mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_RH(m) = w_spec * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + w_arith * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

Weight lock (anti-cheat, pre-registered, and auditable):

* w_spec + w_arith = 1
* w_spec and w_arith are fixed before any experiment runs.
* w_spec is in [0.2, 0.8] and w_arith is in [0.2, 0.8].
* Any change to weights after seeing evaluation outputs invalidates the experiment as "not admissible" for this encoding class.

Admissible encoding class lock (reference class + fairness constraints):

To prevent "choose ref so tension is always small", we define an admissible encoding class Enc_RH by locking both references and constraints.

* Enc_RH consists of tuples (Ref_spec, Ref_arith, w_spec, w_arith, CouplingRule) such that:

  1. Ref_spec and Ref_arith are chosen from the admissible reference classes defined below.
  2. w_spec and w_arith satisfy the weight lock above.
  3. CouplingRule is fixed and declared before evaluation, mapping (R, I, r) into paired inputs for m_R and m_I.

Admissible reference class for spectral data:

* Ref_spec must be selected from a declared, finite library built only from:

  * closed-form baseline densities and envelopes implied by the standard analytic framework of zeta(s) (for example, Riemann-von Mangoldt type density baselines),
  * and optional secondary statistics baselines drawn from published random matrix inspired reference ensembles.
* Ref_spec is allowed to depend on (R, r) where r is a declared resolution parameter in Par.
* Ref_spec is not allowed to depend on the evaluation dataset values of zero positions in a way that is fitted after inspection.

Admissible reference class for arithmetic data:

* Ref_arith must be selected from a declared, finite library built only from:

  * baseline prime distribution approximations and envelopes consistent with standard analytic number theory references,
  * and published explicit bounds or benchmark envelopes that are defined independently of the evaluation set.
* Ref_arith is allowed to depend on (I, r) where r is a declared resolution parameter in Par.
* Ref_arith is not allowed to be chosen or tuned after seeing the evaluation dataset.

Fairness constraint (no post-hoc adaptation):

* Ref_spec, Ref_arith, and weights must be frozen before any evaluation.
* The freeze action is audited by publishing:

  * the exact library choices,
  * the CouplingRule,
  * and a hash of the full encoding spec text.
* Any "choose after seeing results" behavior is a falsification of the encoding procedure itself, not evidence about RH.

### 3.3 Effective tension tensor components

We assume an effective semantic tension tensor T_ij over M, consistent with the TU core decision:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_RH(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where:

* S_i(m) is a source-like factor representing the strength of the ith semantic source component in m.
* C_j(m) is a receptivity-like factor representing how sensitive the jth downstream component is to RH-related mismatches.
* DeltaS_RH(m) is the combined mismatch defined above under the locked admissible class.
* lambda(m) is a convergence-state factor taking values in a fixed range encoding convergent vs divergent behavior states.
* kappa is a coupling constant setting the overall scale of RH-related spectral tension.

The exact indexing sets for i and j are not needed at the effective layer. It is sufficient that for each m in M_reg, T_ij(m) is well defined and finite.

### 3.4 Invariants and effective constraints

We define the following effective invariants using only countable, scale-locked region families. This prevents "thin region" free-parameter exploits.

Resolution index and admissible region family lock:

* Choose a countable resolution ladder r_k in Par, indexed by k = 1,2,3,...
* For each r_k, define a countable family of admissible regions Regions(r_k).
* Any "sup over regions" is always taken over Regions(r_k) for some declared k, and never over arbitrary uncountable collections.

1. Critical line invariance (scale locked)

Let Regions_line(r_k) be the admissible family of vertical regions at scale r_k that approximate the critical line.

Define a scale-indexed invariant:

`I_line_k(m) = sup_R_in_Regions_line(r_k) DeltaS_spec(m_R)`

Define the multi-scale invariant:

`I_line(m) = sup_k I_line_k(m)`

Audit note:

* All Regions_line(r_k) must be explicitly specified by a deterministic rule (for example, fixed thickness and fixed bounding boxes on the imaginary axis grid at scale r_k).
* The countability and deterministic construction are what make sup meaningful and externally auditable.

2. Spectral statistics invariance (scale locked)

Define, for each r_k, a countable family Regions_stats(r_k) and a fixed statistic extractor stat_zero.

`I_stats_k(m) = sup_R_in_Regions_stats(r_k) abs(stat_zero(m_R) - stat_ref(R, r_k))`

Define:

`I_stats(m) = sup_k I_stats_k(m)`

Here:

* stat_ref(R, r_k) is determined by the frozen Ref_spec choice and does not depend on evaluation set tuning.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may be undefined or not finite if encoded data are incomplete or inconsistent. To handle this, define a singular set S_sing by an explicit domain rule:

```txt
S_sing is a subset of M
m is in S_sing if DeltaS_RH(m) is undefined or not finite
```

We impose:

* All RH-related tension analysis is restricted to M_reg, where M_reg is the set of states m in M that are not in S_sing.
* If an experiment attempts to evaluate DeltaS_RH on a state outside M_reg, the outcome is "out of domain" and must not be interpreted as evidence about RH.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q001 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer, with refinement and admissible-class locks.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective RH tension functional:

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = F(DeltaS_spec(m_R), DeltaS_arith(m_I))
```

where F is a fixed nonnegative function, for example:

```txt
Tension_RH(m) = alpha * DeltaS_spec(m_R) + beta * DeltaS_arith(m_I)
```

with alpha > 0 and beta > 0.

Coefficient lock (anti-cheat):

* alpha + beta = 1
* alpha and beta are fixed before any experiment runs.
* alpha is in [0.2, 0.8] and beta is in [0.2, 0.8].
* alpha and beta are part of the admissible encoding tuple, and are frozen with the same audit requirements as weights.

### 4.2 RH as a low-tension principle (refinement order locked)

At the effective layer, RH is expressed as a low-tension consistency claim under an admissible encoding.

Refinement order lock:

* Choose a resolution ladder r_k in Par as in Block 3.4.
* For each k, let m_k be a state in M_reg representing the world at resolution r_k under the same frozen encoding tuple in Enc_RH.
* The sequence (m_k) is the only object on which "refinement" statements are allowed in this file.

Low-tension formulation:

> In RH-true worlds, for any fixed admissible encoding tuple in Enc_RH, there exist world-representing sequences (m_k) such that Tension_RH(m_k) stays bounded in a narrow band across k.

Formally at the effective layer, for some k0:

`sup_k_ge_k0 Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH`

where epsilon_RH is a declared threshold determined before evaluation and tied to the fixed tolerance model of the chosen reference class and resolution ladder.

### 4.3 RH failure as persistent high tension (encoding class locked)

If RH is false, the "persistent high tension" statement is only meaningful relative to a restricted admissible encoding class. This is why Enc_RH was locked in Block 3.2.

High-tension formulation:

> In RH-false worlds, for any fixed admissible encoding tuple in Enc_RH, any world-representing sequence (m_k) eventually has tension bounded away from zero.

Effective-layer statement using the refinement ladder:

There exists a strictly positive constant delta_RH(Enc_RH) such that, for each fixed encoding tuple in Enc_RH, there exists k0 with:

`inf_k_ge_k0 Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc_RH)`

This prevents the "change ref or weights until delta becomes zero" exploit, because:

* reference choices are restricted to admissible frozen classes,
* weights and coefficients are locked and audited,
* Regions(r_k) is deterministic and countable.

Thus, Q001 is framed as the distinction between low-tension vs persistent high-tension worlds under a pre-registered and externally auditable encoding class.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We outline two counterfactual worlds, described strictly at the effective layer:

* World T: RH is true.
* World F: RH is false.

Each world is described through observable tension patterns under a fixed admissible encoding tuple. No hidden construction rules are provided.

### 5.1 World T (RH true, low spectral tension)

In World T, for any fixed encoding tuple in Enc_RH:

1. Critical line behavior

* For world-representing sequences (m_k) on the declared resolution ladder:

  `I_line(m_k)` remains small and stable across k.

2. Spectral statistics

* `I_stats(m_k)` matches, within the pre-registered tolerance model, the frozen stat_ref baselines derived from the chosen Ref_spec library.

3. Arithmetic profiles

* `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` stays within the pre-registered tolerance model tied to Ref_arith across the declared interval families I that are coupled to Regions(r_k).

4. Global tension

* There exists k0 such that:

  `sup_k_ge_k0 Tension_RH(m_k) <= epsilon_RH`

where epsilon_RH is declared before evaluation.

### 5.2 World F (RH false, high spectral tension)

In World F, for any fixed encoding tuple in Enc_RH:

1. Critical line deviation

* For any world-representing sequence (m_k), the scale-locked invariant cannot stay arbitrarily small:

  there exists k0 such that `I_line(m_k)` is bounded away from 0 for k >= k0.

2. Spectral statistics anomaly

* `I_stats(m_k)` eventually deviates from the frozen stat_ref in a way that does not shrink under increasing k.

3. Arithmetic distortion

* There exist coupled intervals I on the ladder where `DeltaS_arith(m_I)` violates the pre-registered tolerance envelope tied to Ref_arith.

4. Global tension

* There exists k0 such that:

  `inf_k_ge_k0 Tension_RH(m_k) >= delta_RH(Enc_RH)`

where delta_RH(Enc_RH) is a class-level lower bound under the locked admissible class.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not claim to construct TU internal fields from raw data. They only assert that if faithful world-representing sequences exist under the locked encoding class, then the observable tension patterns differ as described.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q001 encoding,
* discriminate between alternative admissible encoding tuples,
* falsify specific TU encodings for Q001.

These experiments do not prove or disprove RH. They can falsify an encoding procedure or falsify a specific encoding tuple.

### Experiment 1: Numerical spectral tension profile (pre-registered encoding)

*Goal:*
Test whether the frozen Tension_RH functional and frozen reference classes produce stable, non-cheatable tension profiles on published numerical datasets.

*Setup:*

* Input data: published tables of nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) up to a stated height range, and associated prime counting summaries over coupled ranges.
* Declare the resolution ladder r_k, Regions(r_k), and the coupling rule that pairs regions R with intervals I.
* Freeze the encoding tuple in Enc_RH:

  * Ref_spec choice from the admissible Ref_spec library,
  * Ref_arith choice from the admissible Ref_arith library,
  * w_spec, w_arith, alpha, beta within locked constraints,
  * and publish a hash of the full encoding spec before evaluation.

*Protocol:*

1. For each k on the declared ladder, form states m_k in M_reg that represent the world at that scale (without describing any TU-internal construction from raw data).
2. Compute DeltaS_spec(m_R) and DeltaS_arith(m_I) using the frozen reference choices.
3. Compute Tension_RH(m_k) for each k.
4. Compute I_line_k(m_k) and I_stats_k(m_k) using the deterministic region families.
5. Report all results with the exact encoding tuple and the hash.

*Metrics:*

* The sequence Tension_RH(m_k) across k.
* The sequences I_line_k(m_k) and I_stats_k(m_k) across k.
* Sensitivity under allowed, pre-declared perturbations (only if a family of encoding tuples was pre-registered).

*Falsification conditions:*

* If, under the frozen admissible encoding tuple, Tension_RH(m_k) is unstable in the sense that it has uncontrolled jumps across adjacent k that cannot be attributed to declared tolerance or declared resolution effects, the encoding tuple is rejected as not robust.
* If post-hoc adjustments to Ref_spec, Ref_arith, or weights are required to obtain "reasonable" tension bands, then the procedure is rejected as not admissible for Q001.
* If the encoding yields materially different conclusions under small parameter changes that were not pre-registered, the encoding is rejected as non-auditable.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All calculations must follow the semantics choice declared in Block 0, and the operator interpretations used by DeltaS_spec and DeltaS_arith must remain unchanged across k.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying TU encoding != solving canonical statement

---

### Experiment 2: Model-world comparison with mock zeta-like functions (class separation)

*Goal:*
Test whether the frozen Q001 encoding can separate RH-like vs non-RH-like spectral families under the same admissible encoding class, without tuning after seeing outcomes.

*Setup:*

* Construct or select zeta-like families:

  * Family T: functions with zeros constrained to a single vertical line by construction.
  * Family F: functions with a declared fraction of zeros off that line by construction.
* For each function, generate synthetic spectral and arithmetic-like summaries to populate states m_k on the same resolution ladder.
* Freeze the encoding tuple in Enc_RH exactly as in Experiment 1.

*Protocol:*

1. For each family element and each k, build a state m_k in M_reg representing that model at scale r_k.
2. Compute DeltaS_spec, DeltaS_arith, and Tension_RH for all m_k using frozen references and weights.
3. Compare the tension distributions between Family T and Family F across k.
4. Repeat only across pre-registered encoding tuples if a family was declared in advance.

*Metrics:*

* Separation between Family T and Family F in Tension_RH at each k.
* Stability of separation across k.
* Agreement between separation and the known construction labels T vs F.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If the encoding fails to separate Family T from Family F across k for the frozen admissible tuple, the encoding is rejected as misaligned for Q001.
* If the encoding systematically assigns lower tension to Family F than Family T under the frozen tuple, the encoding is rejected as directionally incorrect.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All calculations must follow the semantics choice declared in Block 0, and the same deterministic Regions(r_k) and CouplingRule must be used.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying TU encoding != solving canonical statement

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q001 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that encourage RH-aware and tension-aware reasoning under the encoding.

1. `signal_zero_spectrum_stability`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to DeltaS_spec evaluated on the coupled (m_R) inputs across declared regions.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply spectral patterns inconsistent with the frozen reference baselines.

2. `signal_prime_error_profile`

   * Definition: a penalty derived from DeltaS_arith evaluated on coupled (m_I) inputs across declared intervals.
   * Purpose: discourage internal representations that imply arithmetic profiles outside the frozen tolerance envelope.

3. `signal_spectral_tension_score`

   * Definition: the scalar Tension_RH(m) under the frozen admissible tuple.
   * Purpose: provide a single measurable indicator of RH-consistency tension.

4. `signal_counterfactual_consistency`

   * Definition: a consistency penalty when the model mixes World T and World F assumptions in the same explanation under a declared stance prompt.
   * Purpose: enforce clean separation of counterfactual assumptions rather than blended narratives.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q001 structures without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

1. `SpectralTensionHead`

   * Role: produce an estimate of Tension_RH as an auxiliary output from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings -> scalar tension estimate + optional decomposed mismatch vector.

2. `ArithmeticConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: score candidate statements about primes for compatibility with frozen Ref_arith envelopes.
   * Interface: candidate statement representation -> soft score or mask.

3. `TU_SpecField_Observer`

   * Role: extract simplified spectral summaries (rho_zero-like descriptors) from internal representations.
   * Interface: internal embeddings -> low-dimensional spectral summary.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

1. Task selection

   * Use analytic number theory prompts where RH strengthens bounds or sharpens error terms.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: no explicit Q001 tension modules.
   * TU encoded: include SpectralTensionHead and ArithmeticConsistencyFilter driven by the frozen encoding tuple.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy under RH-assumed prompts.
   * Consistency across RH-assumed vs RH-denying prompts.
   * Stability of multi-step reasoning without contradictions.

### 7.4 60-second reproduction protocol

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: explain links between zeta zeros, prime distribution, error terms, and random matrix heuristics.
  * Log: response text and any self-reported uncertainty markers.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same, plus require an explicit tension narrative that references the frozen Tension_RH and distinguishes World T vs World F.
  * Log: response text plus any produced tension scores.

* Comparison metric

  * Rate structural coherence, explicit linkage quality, and counterfactual separation quality.

* What to log

  * Prompts, outputs, encoding tuple hash, and any auxiliary tension traces.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block positions Q001 on the TU verification ladder and declares next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E2

  * A coherent effective encoding of RH via spectral_tension is specified.
  * Experiments exist that can falsify an encoding tuple or procedure.

* N_level: N2

  * The linkage between spectral and arithmetic observables is explicit at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds are specified in an auditable way using a fixed refinement ladder.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E3

To move from E2 to E3, implement at least one:

1. A public, reproducible prototype that computes Tension_RH(m_k), I_line_k(m_k), and I_stats_k(m_k) on a declared r_k ladder, publishing:

   * the full encoding tuple,
   * the deterministic region families,
   * and the pre-registration hash.

2. A public benchmark on mock zeta-like families that demonstrates stable separation of Family T vs Family F under a frozen admissible encoding tuple, with independent replication.

Both steps are compatible with the effective-layer boundary because they operate on observables and audited encoding tuples, not on any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

Q001 is expected to serve as:

* The reference node for spectral_tension problems across mathematics and physics.
* A calibration ground for auditable tension encodings that avoid proof-claims.
* A bridge node connecting pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and AI interpretability via shared spectral-tension structure.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The classical Riemann Hypothesis says:

> In the critical strip, all nontrivial zeros of zeta(s) line up on the line with real part equal to 1/2.

Why it matters: the pattern of these zeros controls how primes fluctuate around their average distribution. If the zeros are well organized, prime fluctuations are constrained.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not claim a proof. We define an effective tension score:

* one part measures how far the observed zero statistics deviate from a frozen reference baseline,
* one part measures how far prime-related summaries deviate from a frozen reference baseline,
* both are combined into a single number Tension_RH.

The key anti-cheat idea is that the reference baselines and weights are frozen before evaluation. You cannot look at results and then pick a new baseline that makes tension small.

Then we compare two world patterns:

* In a RH-true world, there should exist a consistent sequence of descriptions at increasing resolution where Tension_RH stays in a small, stable band.
* In a RH-false world, under the same frozen admissible encoding class, any consistent sequence eventually shows tension bounded away from zero.

This does not decide RH. It does something different and testable: it makes the RH world-vs-non-RH world distinction auditable at the effective layer, without revealing any deep TU internal construction rules.

## Footer: Beta scope, falsifiability, and non-mutation policy

This document is part of the "TensionUniverse / BlackHole S-problem" Beta.

Scope boundary:
- This file does NOT claim a proof or a solution of the canonical statement.
- This file provides an effective-layer encoding: state space, fields, observables, invariants, and discriminating tests.
- Any TU Deep axioms, generators, or constructive rules are intentionally not included.

Falsifiability boundary:
- The tests in Block 6 are designed to falsify the TU encoding, not to settle the underlying open problem.
- "Encoding falsified" and "canonical statement solved" are different claims.

Non-mutation policy:
- Definitions and symbols in this file are frozen for this version.
- Revisions, if needed, must be published as a new versioned file (or a changelog entry) and must not silently alter prior definitions.
