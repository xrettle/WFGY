## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this page is to encode problem Q035 as a finite set of state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual patterns that can be tested and reused.
* It does **not** prove or disprove the canonical metrology problem in Section 1.
* It does **not** introduce any new theorem or any new fundamental limit beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It must **not** be cited as evidence that any ultimate quantum metrology bound has been rigorously established or violated.
* All TU specific objects here are effective summaries. They do not expose any deep TU generative rules or axiom systems.
* Rejecting or refining a particular Q035 encoding means only that this encoding failed TU style consistency and falsifiability checks. It does not by itself refute quantum mechanics or confirm the existence of better than known limits.

Whenever this page refers to “worlds” or “patterns” it refers only to patterns in observable summaries and tension scores at the effective layer, not to ontological claims about the universe.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Quantum metrology studies how precisely one can estimate physical parameters using quantum systems and measurements. Typical tasks include estimating:

* a phase shift in an interferometer,
* a frequency or energy splitting,
* a small field strength,
* a time delay or propagation constant.

In each task, there are constraints on the available resources, such as:

* number of probes `N`,
* total interrogation time `T`,
* average energy or photon number `E`,
* access to entanglement, coherence, or ancillary systems,
* noise model and environment, for example dephasing, loss, or thermal noise.

Classical metrology leads to the so called standard quantum limit (SNL), where the mean squared error scales as

```txt
error ~ 1 / sqrt(R_eff)
```

for an appropriate effective resource measure `R_eff`, for example `R_eff = N`. Under ideal conditions and carefully prepared entangled states, quantum metrology can in principle achieve Heisenberg like scaling

```txt
error ~ 1 / R_eff
```

when all relevant resources are accounted for.

The canonical question addressed by Q035 at the effective layer is:

> Given a well specified parameter estimation task, a resource budget, and a noise model, what are the exact achievable limits on estimation precision, and how can we encode the tension between claimed protocols and those limits in a way that is stable, falsifiable, and transferable?

This includes:

* defining effective resource metrics and error measures,
* encoding known or conjectured lower bounds on error in terms of those resources,
* characterizing when apparent violations, for example “super Heisenberg” scaling, are genuine or artifacts of incomplete resource accounting.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Several major results in quantum estimation theory establish bounds on estimation error using tools such as:

* quantum Fisher information (QFI),
* classical Fisher information (CFI),
* quantum Cramer Rao inequalities,
* geometric distances on the space of quantum states.

For many standard single parameter models with simple noise, the optimal asymptotic scaling is known and can sometimes be achieved by explicit protocols. However, there remain significant challenges:

* multi parameter estimation with incompatible observables,
* complex noise models and decoherence,
* adaptive and sequential strategies,
* full accounting of all physical resources, including control pulses, ancillas, and error correction overhead,
* regimes where entanglement and nonclassical states provide advantages that are subtle to quantify.

The difficulty is not only to derive abstract bounds. It is to encode them in a way that:

* is robust under changed modeling assumptions,
* does not allow hidden resource redefinitions,
* can be used across domains as a reusable template for “limits under constraints”.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q035 plays several roles.

1. It is the primary node for translating “fundamental limits on quantum parameter estimation” into a structured consistency tension between resources, noise, and error statistics.
2. It provides a template for how to encode limit statements in other domains, for example computation, thermodynamics, or AI probing, using similar resource versus performance structures.
3. It acts as a bridge between theoretical quantum estimation results and practical questions such as:

   * when a claimed metrological advantage can be trusted,
   * how to interpret “beating the Heisenberg limit” under full resource accounting,
   * how to compare different experimental designs in a unified tension framework.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block locates Q035 within the BlackHole graph. Each edge is given with a one line reason referring to concrete components or tension types. All references are internal Q identifiers.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or general frameworks that Q035 depends on at the effective layer.

* Q021 (BH_PHYS_QG_L3_021)
  Reason: Supplies a framework for how quantum fields and spacetime resources are defined at high energy scales, which constrains how extreme metrology tasks must count resources.

  Reason: Encodes how quantum behavior degrades to classical limits under noise and coarse graining, a key ingredient in defining standard quantum limits.

* Q031 (BH_PHYS_EFT_GRAV_BREAK_L3_031)
  Reason: Gives bounds on the validity of effective field theories, which restrict the regime where metrological claims about fundamental constants can be made.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q035 components or treat Q035 as a prerequisite.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Uses Q035 resource and limit encoding to bound how precisely microscopic parameters can be inferred from noisy condensed matter experiments.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar structure and tension types but do not depend directly on Q035 components.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Both Q032 and Q035 encode resource versus performance limits, but in thermodynamic work extraction and parameter estimation respectively.

  Reason: Both study how quantum advantages shrink toward classical behavior as noise and scale increase, viewed through different observables.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: In both problems, complex many body fields create a gap between microscopic quantum description and coarse grained observables that must be reconciled.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Shares the same “precision versus cost” structure, borrowing Q035 style resource measures and tension scores.

* Q101 (BH_SOC_MACRO_FORECAST_L3_101)
  Reason: Treats macro level forecasting as a noisy parameter estimation problem, importing Q035 style limits into social and economic observables.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Applies metrological notions of probing internal AI structures with fixed resource budgets, with Q035 providing the core template.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We describe only:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rule or explicit mapping from raw laboratory data to internal TU fields.

The metadata line `Semantics: continuous` refers to the fact that the physical variables of interest such as resources, errors, and information measures vary over continuous ranges. The scenario library and encoding classes introduced below are finite and discrete index sets used only to organise these continuous summaries.

### 3.1 State space

We define an effective state space

```txt
M_35
```

Elements `m` in `M_35` are interpreted as “quantum metrology experiment configurations” at the level needed for tension analysis. For each `m`, the encoding exposes the following effective components:

* A parameter label `theta` to be estimated.

* A resource tuple

  ```txt
  R = (N, T, E)
  ```

  where:

  * `N` is an effective probe number,
  * `T` is an effective interrogation time,
  * `E` is an effective energy or signal strength measure.

* A noise label `noise(m)` taken from a fixed finite noise set

  ```txt
  Noise_set = { noiseless, dephasing, loss, thermal, composite }
  ```

* An experiment strategy label `strategy(m)` that identifies:

  * a probe state class, for example coherent, GHZ like, spin squeezed,
  * a measurement class, for example photon counting, homodyne, collective spin readout,
  * a data processing rule.

We do not specify how any of these components are constructed or implemented. We only assume that for each physically meaningful scenario in the intended scope, there exists at least one `m` in `M_35` that encodes it.

### 3.2 Finite reference library and admissible encoding class

We define a finite reference library

```txt
L_Q35 = { scenario_1, scenario_2, ..., scenario_K }
```

Each `scenario_k` is a labeled combination of:

* a parameter type and target value,
* a resource budget range,
* a noise model from `Noise_set`,
* a strategy template, for example coherent state interferometry, GHZ metrology, spin squeezing plus adaptive readout.

The library `L_Q35` is fixed in advance for Q035 and is not allowed to change after any experiment has been evaluated.

An admissible encoding class `E_Q35` is defined as the set of all maps from `L_Q35` into tuples

```txt
(R_eff, error_stat, qfi_stat, noise_label, strategy_label)
```

such that:

1. `R_eff` is computed from the underlying physical description using a fixed, scenario independent rule, chosen in advance from a small finite catalogue. For example:

   ```txt
   R_eff = N
   R_eff = N * T
   R_eff = N * E
   ```

   The rule used becomes part of the encoding specification and is not adjusted after seeing outcomes.

2. `error_stat` is a scalar or low dimensional vector summarizing estimation error for the parameter `theta` in that scenario. It must be based on standard error measures such as mean squared error, and it must be fixed in advance for each scenario type. It is not tuned post hoc to match a desired limit.

3. `qfi_stat` is a summary of the quantum Fisher information or a related bound for the given scenario.

4. `noise_label` is taken from `Noise_set`.

5. `strategy_label` identifies the strategy class from a fixed finite list.

Fairness constraints for `E_Q35`:

* The rule that determines `R_eff`, `error_stat`, and `qfi_stat` must be fixed before any tension evaluation is performed on that scenario family.
* It is forbidden to change `R_eff` or redefine error measures after observing whether a scenario appears to beat a limit.
* Encodings that depend on outcomes of `error_stat` to choose `R_eff` are not in `E_Q35`.

All effective tension analysis in Q035 is restricted to encodings in `E_Q35`.

### 3.3 Observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables on `M_35` for admissible encodings.

1. Effective resource metric

```txt
R_eff(m) >= 0
```

* A scalar resource measure derived from `R = (N, T, E)` and the noise label via a fixed rule declared in the encoding.

2. Error observable

```txt
error(m) >= 0
```

* A scalar summarizing the estimation error for `theta` under the strategy encoded in `m`.
* Typically a mean squared error or a similar one dimensional measure.

3. Quantum Fisher information summary

```txt
QFI(m) >= 0
```

* A scalar or effective scalar derived from the quantum Fisher information for the probe and noise model encoded in `m`.

4. Classical Fisher information summary

```txt
CFI(m) >= 0
```

* A scalar or effective scalar derived from the classical statistics of measurement outcomes under the strategy encoded in `m`.

5. Scaling exponent estimator

For a scenario `scenario_k` realized at multiple resource levels

```txt
R_eff(m_1), R_eff(m_2), ..., R_eff(m_L)
```

with corresponding errors

```txt
error(m_1), error(m_2), ..., error(m_L)
```

we define a scaling exponent estimate

```txt
alpha(m_1, ..., m_L)
```

obtained by fitting a model of the form

```txt
error ~ c / (R_eff ^ alpha)
```

over a finite set of resource levels. The precise fitting procedure, for example log log regression over a fixed window, is part of the encoding design and is fixed in advance.

### 3.4 Limit references and invariants

We choose a finite family of reference limit functions

```txt
Limit_family = { Limit_SNL, Limit_HL, Limit_noise_1, ..., Limit_noise_J }
```

Each `Limit_j(R_eff)` is a nonnegative function on the nonnegative reals, representing a theoretically justified lower bound on `error` for a given noise class and resource definition.

Examples include:

* `Limit_SNL(R_eff) = c_1 / sqrt(R_eff)` for standard quantum limit behavior.
* `Limit_HL(R_eff) = c_2 / R_eff` for Heisenberg like scaling under ideal conditions.
* `Limit_noise_j(R_eff)` capturing decoherence limited scaling for particular noise models.

The constants and formulas in `Limit_family` are specified once at the level of the encoding family and are not adjusted per scenario after outcomes are known.

For each state `m` in `M_35` with noise label `noise(m)`, we select an appropriate limit function

```txt
Limit_Q35(m; R_eff) in Limit_family
```

according to fixed rules determined by `noise(m)` and `strategy_label`. This selection rule is also declared in advance as part of the encoding.

We then define a main mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_Q35_limit(m) =
  max( 0, error(m) - Limit_Q35(m; R_eff(m)) )
```

which measures by how much the observed or encoded error exceeds the selected limit. If `error(m)` lies below the chosen limit, `DeltaS_Q35_limit(m)` is zero.

Additional invariants:

1. Scaling stability invariant

For a set of states representing a single scenario at multiple resource levels, we define

```txt
I_scaling = | alpha(m_1, ..., m_L) - alpha_ref |
```

where `alpha_ref` is a reference exponent associated with the chosen limit function, for example `alpha_ref = 1/2` for SNL or `alpha_ref = 1` for HL.

2. Resource fairness invariant

We define

```txt
I_resource = |R_eff(m) - R_base(m)|
```

where `R_base(m)` is a baseline resource estimate derived from a simplified physical model that counts probes, time, and energy in a standard way. Large or inconsistent deviations of `I_resource` across similar scenarios signal anomalies in resource accounting.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some configurations lead to ill defined or divergent observables. We define a singular set

```txt
S_sing_35 = {
  m in M_35 :
    QFI(m) is undefined or infinite
    or error(m) is undefined or infinite
    or R_eff(m) is undefined or not finite
    or Limit_Q35(m; R_eff(m)) is undefined or not finite
}
```

The regular domain is

```txt
M_35_reg = M_35 \ S_sing_35
```

Rules:

* All tension functionals and invariants in Q035 are evaluated only on `M_35_reg`.
* States with `R_eff(m) = 0` or with degenerate error definitions are treated as trivial or out of scope and are placed in `S_sing_35` unless the encoding explicitly defines a special case.
* When a protocol description leads to a state in `S_sing_35`, this is treated as “out of domain” for Q035 tension analysis, not as evidence for or against the physical limits themselves. Such cases may motivate refining `L_Q35` or `E_Q35`, but only through explicit versioned updates.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q035 is viewed as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define an effective consistency tension functional

```txt
Tension_Q35(m) =
    w_limit   * DeltaS_Q35_limit(m)
  + w_scaling * I_scaling(m_group)
  + w_resource * I_resource(m)
```

where:

* `w_limit`, `w_scaling`, and `w_resource` are fixed nonnegative weights chosen once for the entire encoding class `E_Q35`.
* `m_group` is a small set of states representing the same scenario at different `R_eff` values, used to compute `I_scaling`. The grouping rule is part of the encoding and is not changed after seeing results.

Properties:

* `Tension_Q35(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_35_reg`.

* `Tension_Q35(m)` is small when:

  * `error(m)` tracks the appropriate limit `Limit_Q35(m; R_eff(m))` within expected modeling and statistical uncertainty,
  * scaling exponents match the theoretical expectations within a small tolerance,
  * resource accounting is consistent with baseline models.

* `Tension_Q35(m)` is large when:

  * error statistics, scaling patterns, or resource usage differ in a way that contradicts known quantum estimation theory under the chosen resource definition,
  * or the data pattern imitates a persistent violation of the reference limits.

Interpretation:

* In the sense of the TU Tension Scale Charter, `Tension_Q35` is a **consistency_tension** scalar. It rates how consistent a configuration is with a chosen family of metrology limits and resource rules.
* It is **not** an energy, stress, or force in spacetime. It has no direct mechanical effect and should not be interpreted as a physical observable outside its defined role.

### 4.2 TU aligned metrology worlds

At the effective layer, a TU aligned metrology world is one in which:

* There exists at least one encoding in `E_Q35` such that, for all physically realizable scenarios in the intended scope, there are states `m_true` in `M_35_reg` satisfying

  ```txt
  Tension_Q35(m_true) <= epsilon_Q35
  ```

  for some small threshold `epsilon_Q35` determined by modeling uncertainties and experimental variability.

* For protocols that are claimed to saturate or approach fundamental limits, such as Heisenberg scaling under specific noise models, the low tension region is stable under:

  * modest refinement of resource definitions within the fixed catalogue,
  * inclusion of realistic noise contributions,
  * increased measurement statistics and refined error analysis.

### 4.3 TU misaligned metrology worlds

A TU misaligned metrology world is one in which, even after adopting fair resource accounting and realistic noise models, one can construct families of states `m_claim` in `M_35_reg` such that:

* The encoded errors appear to beat all applicable `Limit_Q35(m; R_eff(m))` across resource levels, and
* For any encoding in `E_Q35` that is faithful to the physical scenario, the tension functional satisfies

  ```txt
  Tension_Q35(m_claim) >= delta_Q35
  ```

  for some strictly positive `delta_Q35` that does not vanish under refinement in the sense of the chosen encoding family.

In such a world, the pattern of tension readings would be interpreted as evidence that at least one of the following holds.

* Some accepted limit statement used in `Limit_family` needs revision or extension.
* Some modeling assumption used to match experiments to those limits does not correctly describe the behavior of the physical world.

This conclusion still lives at the effective layer. It highlights a discrepancy between observed patterns and the chosen limit catalogue without committing to any particular modification of the underlying physical theory.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now define two counterfactual worlds, both described strictly in terms of observable patterns and admissible encodings. They are pattern labels over tension profiles, not claims about actual universes.

### 5.1 World T: internally consistent limits

In World T:

1. For every scenario class in `L_Q35` and each admissible encoding in `E_Q35`, there exists a regular state `m_T` in `M_35_reg` such that:

   ```txt
   Tension_Q35(m_T) <= epsilon_Q35
   ```

   where `epsilon_Q35` is small compared to the scale of `error(m_T)`.

2. As resource levels increase and encodings are refined along a predetermined sequence `refine(k)`, the tension values remain bounded and stable:

   ```txt
   Tension_Q35(m_T(k)) stays in a small band
   ```

   where `m_T(k)` are refined representations of the same physical scenario.

3. Apparent “super Heisenberg” protocols, when fully encoded with honest `R_eff` and noise models, fall back into the low tension band by revealing hidden resource costs or degraded noise behavior.

4. Quantum estimation theory, as currently formulated in the references listed above, is sufficient to explain the observed patterns in `error`, `QFI`, and scaling exponents within the uncertainty margins captured by the encoding.

### 5.2 World F: persistent violations

In World F:

1. There exists at least one family of scenarios in `L_Q35` and sequences of states `m_F(k)` in `M_35_reg` such that:

   ```txt
   error(m_F(k)) << Limit_Q35(m_F(k); R_eff(m_F(k)))
   ```

   for growing `R_eff(m_F(k))`, where `<<` indicates much smaller than any known bound from the reference limit family, beyond the uncertainties allowed by the encoding.

2. Attempts to incorporate additional resources into `R_eff` or adjust noise models within `E_Q35` do not eliminate this discrepancy. For every encoding in `E_Q35` that respects the formal rules, the tension functional satisfies:

   ```txt
   Tension_Q35(m_F(k)) >= delta_Q35
   ```

   for some `delta_Q35 > 0` independent of `k`.

3. Scaling exponents `alpha(m_F(k))` remain significantly larger than the theoretical `alpha_ref` associated with the applicable limit, even when the sample size, noise characterization, and resource definitions are systematically improved within the encoding rules.

4. The persistent high tension cannot be attributed to finite sample artifacts or obvious modeling errors within the scope of the encoding. Instead it indicates that the combined package of accepted limits and modeling assumptions is not sufficient to account for the observed effective layer pattern.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not construct internal TU fields from raw microscopic models. They only state that, if there exist encodings in `E_Q35` that faithfully reflect the behavior of physical metrology experiments, then the patterns of `error`, `QFI`, resource usage, and tension would differ in the ways described above in World T and World F.

They are pattern labels over tension profiles in the Q035 encoding. They are not ontological commitments about the real universe and they do not select a unique physical theory.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can falsify particular Q035 encodings within `E_Q35`. Falsification here means rejecting a chosen tension encoding, not proving or disproving any ultimate physical limit.

### Experiment 1: Scaling test under controlled dephasing

*Goal:*
Test whether the chosen `Tension_Q35` encoding correctly classifies standard and entanglement enhanced protocols under a fixed dephasing model, and whether tension remains stable under refinement.

*Setup:*

* Choose a set of phase estimation scenarios in `L_Q35`:

  * Scenario A: coherent state interferometry with dephasing noise.
  * Scenario B: GHZ like or spin squeezed probes with dephasing noise.

* For each scenario, fix:

  * a sequence of resource levels `R_eff` by varying `N` and `T` according to a predefined rule,
  * a noise strength parameter for dephasing, held constant across resource levels.

* For each resource level, define an effective state `m_data` encoding:

  * observed or simulated estimation error `error(m_data)`,
  * `QFI(m_data)` and `CFI(m_data)` summaries,
  * the fixed `R_eff(m_data)` and noise label.

*Protocol:*

1. For each scenario and each resource level, compute `DeltaS_Q35_limit(m_data)` using the agreed reference limits `Limit_SNL` and a fixed dephasing specific `Limit_noise_dephasing` from `Limit_family`.
2. For groups of states representing the same scenario at multiple resource levels, compute `alpha(m_group)` and `I_scaling`. The grouping rule and fitting procedure are declared as part of the encoding.
3. Evaluate `I_resource` using a baseline resource estimate `R_base(m_data)` derived from a simplified physical model that treats control overhead consistently across resource levels.
4. Compute `Tension_Q35(m_data)` for all states.
5. Analyze how `Tension_Q35` behaves as resource levels increase and as the refinement index `k` moves along a predetermined refinement sequence, for example finer time resolution or more accurate noise calibration.

*Metrics:*

* Distribution of `Tension_Q35` values for Scenario A versus Scenario B.
* Trend of `Tension_Q35` with increasing `R_eff`.
* Stability of `I_scaling` and `I_resource` across refinement steps.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If Scenario A, which is classically motivated, consistently shows low tension and Scenario B, which is entanglement enhanced in a regime where theory predicts a genuine advantage, shows systematically higher tension even after fair resource accounting, the encoding may be misaligned.
* If small, justified changes in the modeling details, such as small variations in dephasing rate within experimental uncertainty, cause large, discontinuous jumps in `Tension_Q35` classification for similar states, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.
* If no choice of reasonable weights `w_limit`, `w_scaling`, and `w_resource` chosen once for the encoding yields a clear separation between well understood protocols and obviously flawed toy protocols, the chosen form of `Tension_Q35` is considered inadequate.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All quantities are treated as continuous functions of resource and noise parameters consistent with the metadata. Discrete sampling of resource levels is only an approximation to the underlying continuous dependence and does not change the field type.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a specific Q035 encoding in this experiment means only that the chosen encoding does not provide a stable, fair, and discriminative description of the data pattern. It does not prove or disprove any canonical metrology limit or any underlying physical law. It also does not reveal any TU core generative mechanism.

---

### Experiment 2: Multi parameter and adaptive protocol test

*Goal:*
Evaluate whether the Q035 encoding remains coherent and discriminative when applied to multi parameter and adaptive metrology protocols.

*Setup:*

* Select a small set of multi parameter Ramsey spectroscopy or atomic ensemble experiments in `L_Q35`, each involving:

  * simultaneous estimation of a vector `theta = (theta_1, theta_2)`,
  * a chosen adaptive measurement strategy,
  * a specific noise model, for example partial dephasing plus loss.

* For each experiment and resource level, construct a state `m_multi` in `M_35_reg` encoding:

  * marginal and joint error summaries for the parameters,
  * aggregated `QFI(m_multi)` and `CFI(m_multi)` entries,
  * a vector resource measure collapsed to a scalar `R_eff(m_multi)` via a fixed rule from the encoding catalogue.

*Protocol:*

1. Define a finite family of extended reference limit functions

   ```txt
   Limit_family_multi = { Limit_multi_1, ..., Limit_multi_L }
   ```

   based on known multi parameter bounds or conservative extensions of single parameter limits. Select one `Limit_multi` from this family for each multi parameter scenario according to fixed rules that depend only on `noise(m_multi)` and `strategy_label`. The selection is fixed before any outcome is processed.

2. For each `m_multi`, compute a combined error measure `error(m_multi)` by a fixed norm on the error vector, for example Euclidean norm, declared in advance as part of the encoding.

3. Evaluate

   ```txt
   DeltaS_Q35_limit(m_multi) =
     max( 0, error(m_multi) - Limit_multi(R_eff(m_multi)) )
   ```

   with respect to the chosen `Limit_multi`.

4. For sequences of states at different resource levels, estimate a scaling exponent `alpha_multi` using the fixed fitting rule and compute `I_scaling`.

5. Compute `I_resource` by comparing `R_eff(m_multi)` to a baseline `R_base(m_multi)` that accounts for multi parameter overhead.

6. Compute `Tension_Q35(m_multi)` and compare across different strategies and noise settings.

*Metrics:*

* Comparison of `Tension_Q35` for naive non adaptive strategies versus carefully designed adaptive strategies.
* Behavior of `Tension_Q35` as resource levels and number of adaptive rounds increase.
* Sensitivity of tension to changes in the resource definition rule within the small finite catalogue allowed by `E_Q35`.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If the encoding assigns lower tension to clearly suboptimal strategies than to known near optimal strategies across a broad range of resources, the encoding is considered misaligned.
* If tension classifications for very similar multi parameter setups fluctuate drastically under small and justified changes in modeling details that stay within the encoding rules, the encoding fails a stability requirement and is rejected.
* If for any plausible `Limit_multi` from `Limit_family_multi` the encoding cannot distinguish between clearly inconsistent toy models and realistic protocols, the selection of `Limit_multi` or the way errors are aggregated is considered inadequate and must be revised through an explicit version update.

*Semantics implementation note:*
The multi parameter quantities are modeled as continuous fields over parameter space, with discrete sampling in practice representing finite experimental or numerical resolution.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a Q035 encoding by this experiment rejects a particular choice of limit catalogue, resource mapping, and tension functional. It does not by itself settle whether the canonical multi parameter limits are sharp or loose and does not select between competing physical theories.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q035 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems in the WFGY framework, without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used as auxiliary losses or diagnostics.

1. `signal_resource_scaling_consistency`

   * Definition: a nonnegative signal proportional to `I_scaling` for scenarios where multiple resource levels are available.
   * Purpose: penalize internal representations that imply scaling exponents inconsistent with known limits when the context assumes those limits and the encoding declares them in force.

2. `signal_qfi_vs_error_gap`

   * Definition: a signal constructed from the gap between the Cramer Rao type bound implied by `QFI(m)` and the actual error `error(m)`, under the fixed encoding.
   * Purpose: discourage reasoning patterns that rely on unattainable precision for a given `QFI`.

3. `signal_limit_tension_score`

   * Definition: directly equal to `Tension_Q35(m)` for states associated with problem Q035.
   * Purpose: provide a scalar consistency indicator that can be minimized when the system is instructed to respect known metrology limits in a given scenario.

4. `signal_protocol_classification_stability`

   * Definition: a measure of how stable the classification of protocols, for example “within limits” versus “suspicious”, remains under small variations in problem statements or resource descriptions that do not change the underlying scenario.
   * Purpose: encourage robustness in limit based judgments.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q035 structures.

1. `MetrologyLimitChecker`

   * Role: given a natural language or symbolic description of a metrology scenario, produce an approximate `Tension_Q35` score and simple explanations of which components, limit mismatch, scaling, or resource fairness, contribute most.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: embeddings of the problem description, including parameter type, resource claims, noise description, and protocol class.
     * Outputs: a scalar tension value, plus a small vector for `(DeltaS_Q35_limit, I_scaling, I_resource)`.

2. `ResourceAccountingAssistant`

   * Role: suggest consistent choices for `R_eff` and related resource metrics based on physical and operational descriptions.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: description of experimental setup, including probes, time, control operations, ancillas, and measurement repetitions.
     * Outputs: a small set of candidate `R_eff` definitions, each with a justification and a pointer to which encoding rule it instantiates.

3. `ScalingPatternExtractor`

   * Role: given multiple descriptions or simulation summaries at different resource levels, estimate scaling exponents and generate summaries for use by `MetrologyLimitChecker`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: tuples `(R_eff_i, error_i)` for a scenario.
     * Outputs: estimated `alpha` and uncertainty, plus a flag indicating whether the data supports reliable scaling analysis under the encoding.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for AI systems that use Q035 components.

1. Task selection

   * Assemble a benchmark of metrology related texts, including:

     * real experimental papers and proposals,
     * synthetic scenarios where resource accounting is intentionally incomplete,
     * toy examples that violate known bounds under fair encodings.

2. Experimental conditions

   * Baseline: the model operates without Q035 specific modules.
   * Q035 enhanced: the model uses `MetrologyLimitChecker` and `ResourceAccountingAssistant` to evaluate claims before answering.

3. Metrics

   * Accuracy in identifying obviously inconsistent “beyond Heisenberg” claims under the declared encoding.
   * Rate of false positives, where valid protocols are incorrectly flagged as impossible.
   * Consistency of explanations regarding which resources or noise processes explain why a protocol is or is not within limits.

4. Logging

   * For each task, record the raw answer, the tension scores, and a short structured explanation so that symptoms of failure can be analyzed without revealing TU internals.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to allow external users to feel the impact of Q035 encoding.

*Baseline setup:*

* Prompt: ask an AI system to evaluate whether a given quantum metrology proposal is physically plausible, without mentioning WFGY, TU, or tension.
* Observation: note whether the answer discusses resources, noise, and limits in a coherent way or focuses only on headline scaling claims.

*Q035 encoded setup:*

* Prompt: present the same proposal, but instruct the system to:

  * explicitly identify the resource metric `R_eff`,
  * compare claimed errors to `Limit_SNL` and `Limit_HL` from a declared `Limit_family`,
  * produce an informal `Tension_Q35` style verdict, for example “low tension with SNL” or “high tension with HL under this noise model”.

*Observation:*

* Note whether the answer now highlights hidden resource costs, noise assumptions, and scaling details that were absent in the baseline answer.

*Comparison metric:*

* Evaluate which answer better matches expert expectations about feasibility and which one gives more precise reasons grounded in resources, noise, and limits.

*What to log:*

* The prompts, the two answers, and the scalar tension estimates, for later qualitative and quantitative assessment at the effective layer.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q035 and shows how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `MetrologyResourceMetric_R_eff`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: description of probes, time budget, energy or photon number, control operations
     Output: scalar R_eff >= 0
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The description must provide enough information to compute `R_eff` under one of the fixed rules in `E_Q35`.

2. ComponentName: `ScalingExponentEstimator_alpha`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: finite set of pairs (R_eff_i, error_i)
     Output: alpha_est, alpha_uncertainty
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * At least three distinct resource levels with reliable error estimates.
     * The range of `R_eff_i` is sufficient to support a meaningful scaling fit.

3. ComponentName: `MetrologyTensionFunctional_TQ35`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: R_eff, error, noise_label, strategy_label
     Output: Tension_Q35_value >= 0
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * A suitable limit function from `Limit_family` or `Limit_family_multi` must be defined for the given noise and strategy labels.
     * The state lies in `M_35_reg` so that all observables are well defined.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Target: Q032 (quantum thermodynamics limits)

   * Reused components: `MetrologyResourceMetric_R_eff`, `MetrologyTensionFunctional_TQ35`.
   * Why it transfers: thermodynamic limits also relate performance, for example work extraction or cooling, to resources such as energy and coherence. The same structure of a resource metric, a limit function, and a tension score can be reused.
   * What changes: the observables become thermodynamic output quantities instead of parameter estimation error, and `Limit_family` is replaced by thermodynamic bound functions. The tension score still functions as a consistency_tension scalar in the sense of the TU Tension Scale Charter.

2. Target: Q059 (information versus thermodynamics)

   * Reused components: `MetrologyResourceMetric_R_eff`, `ScalingExponentEstimator_alpha`, `MetrologyTensionFunctional_TQ35`.
   * Why it transfers: information extraction tasks have analogous tradeoffs between resources and accuracy, so the scaling and tension patterns can be reused.
   * What changes: `error` is replaced by information loss or misclassification rates, and resource definitions may include memory and communication costs besides physical energy.

3. Target: Q123 (AI interpretability via spectral probes)

   * Reused components: `MetrologyResourceMetric_R_eff`, `ScalingExponentEstimator_alpha`.
   * Why it transfers: probing internal AI representations resembles an estimation task where probes and compute are resources and interpretability quality is the “precision”.
   * What changes: the noise labels and limits refer to model stochasticity and approximation errors rather than physical decoherence, but the overall structure of resource, error, limit, and scaling remains similar.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains where Q035 stands in the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current verification levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective encoding has been specified, including:

    * a finite library `L_Q35`,
    * an admissible encoding class `E_Q35` with fairness constraints,
    * defined observables and main tension functionals,
    * a singular set `S_sing_35` and regular domain `M_35_reg`.

  * Experiments have been outlined with clear falsification conditions for specific encodings, while maintaining the effective layer boundary.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative linking resources, limits, and tension is explicit but still relatively high level.
  * Counterfactual worlds and cross domain transfers have been sketched, but not yet specialised to large numbers of concrete examples.

### 9.2 Next measurable steps toward higher levels

To move from E1 and N1 toward E2 and N2, at least the following steps should be implemented, all within the effective layer.

1. Instantiate a concrete `L_Q35` with a small finite number of explicit scenarios, for example phase estimation with coherent and GHZ states under several noise models, each with a documented mapping from physical descriptions to states in `M_35_reg`.

2. For each scenario, produce numerical tables that map resource levels to errors, QFI values, and tension scores under one chosen encoding in `E_Q35`. These tables should show how `Tension_Q35` behaves as resources increase.

3. Run the discriminating experiments from Block 6 on real or simulated data and publish tension profiles as open data for independent scrutiny, including example cases where tension is low and cases where it is intentionally high.

4. Document at least one concrete failure case where a naive encoding is falsified and a refined encoding brings tension back into a stable low band, with both encodings clearly labelled as versions of the Q035 effective layer model.

These steps work entirely with observable summaries and fixed encoding rules. They do not require exposing any deep TU generative mechanisms.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q035 is expected to:

* Serve as the reference node for all “limit under constraints” problems involving quantum resources.
* Provide a template for building similar tension encodings in computation, thermodynamics, and AI interpretability.
* Help calibrate how much structure can be encoded at the effective layer before one risks leaking deep generative rules, by comparing high and low tension regions across scenarios.
* Act as a testbed for integrating experimental data, theoretical bounds, and AI reasoning under a unified, falsifiable tension framework.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non specialists while remaining consistent with the effective layer description.

In simple terms, quantum metrology is about using quantum systems to measure things as precisely as possible. For example, you might want to measure a tiny phase shift in an interferometer, a very small magnetic field, or a very accurate clock frequency.

To evaluate what is possible, you have to look at three ingredients.

1. The resources you spend, such as number of particles, time, energy, and how much quantum control you use.
2. The noise around you, such as decoherence, loss, thermal effects, and imperfections.
3. The errors you get, meaning how far your estimate is from the true value, on average.

There are known mathematical limits that say, under certain assumptions, you can never beat certain error scales.

* The standard quantum limit says you should expect an error that goes like `1 / sqrt(N)` if you use `N` independent probes.
* Under ideal conditions and with specially designed quantum states, you can sometimes reach an error that goes like `1 / N`, which is called Heisenberg like scaling.

The challenge is that in real life:

* resources are complicated to count,
* noise is hard to model,
* and there is a temptation to declare “super advantages” without checking all costs.

The Tension Universe view in Q035 does not try to prove new theorems about what is fundamentally possible. It does not claim to have final answers about ultimate bounds. Instead, it asks:

* For each metrology setup, can we encode a few key numbers: a fair resource measure, an error summary, and a limit function chosen from a small predeclared catalogue?
* Can we define a tension score that is small when the setup behaves as theory expects within uncertainty, and large when something is inconsistent with those expectations?

If a claimed protocol looks better than all known limits, but the tension score is small once you include all hidden resources and noise in a fair way, then the claim may be compatible with existing theory. If, after careful accounting under a fixed encoding, the tension remains large and cannot be explained away, then either the claim is flawed or the current package of limits and assumptions is incomplete.

Q035 is the node that formalizes this idea. It tells us how to turn metrology claims into:

* a set of observable quantities,
* a family of reference limits,
* and a consistency tension functional that can be tested and reused.

This helps both humans and AI systems reason about quantum metrology in a structured way, while staying strictly at the effective layer and without exposing any deep internal rules of the Tension Universe framework.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The purpose of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the named problem Q035 and its associated tension patterns.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1 or any other open problem in quantum metrology.
* It does not introduce any new theorem, axiom system, or physical law beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved or that any ultimate metrology bound has been rigorously established or refuted.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here, such as state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, cross problem transfer templates, and counterfactual “worlds”, live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* These objects are summaries over observable data and modeling choices. They do not expose TU generative rules, axiom systems, or constructive procedures for any deeper theory.
* Falsifying or revising a Q035 encoding means only that a particular effective layer encoding is misaligned with observed patterns or fairness constraints. It does not by itself validate or invalidate any underlying physical theory.
* Tension scalars in this document are **consistency_tension** measures in the sense of the TU Tension Scale Charter. They are not energies, stresses, or forces, and they have no direct mechanical interpretation.
