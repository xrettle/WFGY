## 0. Effective-layer disclaimer

All content in this file is restricted to the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This document **does not** introduce any new physical law, axiom system, or deep TU generative rule.
* It **does not** claim to prove or disprove any canonical open problem in physics or complexity theory, including:

  * any final form of “ultimate physical limits” for computation,
  * any separation or equivalence between complexity classes such as P, BPP, BQP, QMA, or related variants.
* It only specifies:

  * an effective-layer **encoding** of how device resources, noise, and physical bounds interact for quantum information processing,
  * a family of **tension functionals** and **experiment patterns** that can falsify or refine this encoding.

Whenever this file talks about “limits”, “frontiers”, “worlds”, or “ultimate bounds”, these are:

* statements **about the encoding and its tension patterns**,
* not claims that any final physical limit has been established or resolved.

All references to AI or WFGY usage describe how Q031 can **constrain model behaviour and evaluation** at the effective layer. They do not grant any new physical capability, and they do not bypass actual resource or noise constraints in the real world.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical question behind Q031 can be phrased as:

> What are the ultimate physical limits on reliable quantum information processing, when one fully accounts for the laws of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, relativity, and realistic noise, and how do these limits constrain the size, speed, accuracy, and energy cost of any physically realizable quantum computer?

At an effective level, this includes (but is not limited to):

* maximum rate of reliable logical operations per unit spacetime volume, under constraints on energy, entropy production, and noise,
* thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computation under realistic local noise models and constrained resources,
* asymptotic scaling relationships between:

  * number of logical qubits,
  * number of physical qubits,
  * error rates,
  * circuit depth,
  * control precision,
  * energy and power budgets,
* compatibility of such limits with broader complexity-theoretic expectations about classes such as BQP and QMA, without assuming or asserting any unresolved separation.

Q031 makes two explicit scope decisions.

1. It does **not** attempt to select a single formal conjecture of the form
   “this expression is the one true ultimate bound”.
   Instead, it treats “ultimate limits of quantum information processing” as a **structured family of constraints** that can be encoded as a tension problem.

2. It does **not** propose or endorse any resolution of complexity questions such as:

   * P vs BPP,
   * P vs BQP,
   * BQP vs QMA,
   * or any related separation or collapse.
     These remain background conjectural structure that Q031 must be compatible with, but does not settle.

Within this scope, Q031 specifies how to encode:

* device architectures and tasks into effective-layer state descriptions,
* resource and noise constraints into mismatch observables,
* and ultimate-limit questions into a tension functional and frontier interpretation.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The status of Q031 is “Partial” in the sense of the BlackHole constitution.

Known ingredients include:

* threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation under specified noise models and architectures,
* quantum speed limits that relate the minimum time required for certain evolutions to energy or norm constraints,
* thermodynamic and Landauer-style bounds on energetic and entropic costs of information processing and control.

However, there is **no** universally accepted, closed-form “ultimate bound” that simultaneously:

* incorporates all relevant physical theories,
* handles realistic device architectures and noise,
* and is known to be tight in all regimes of interest.

Operationally:

* research programs continue to propose improved architectures, error correction schemes, and control strategies that move known feasibility frontiers,
* it remains unclear whether there are hard physical barriers that cannot be crossed, or whether further engineering will push existing frontiers significantly.

Within TU, “Partial” here means:

* Q031 provides an **effective-layer encoding** and **experiment templates** for quantum information processing limits,
* but it does **not** claim a completed theory of ultimate limits and does not act as a proof oracle for any canonical limit statement.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q031:

1. Serves as the primary node for **computational_tension** at the quantum device level, where physical resources and abstract information processing tasks are coupled.
2. Connects foundational quantum physics problems (for example Q026, Q032, Q035, Q040) to computational complexity problems (for example Q051, Q052, Q059).
3. Provides reusable components that:

   * map device descriptions into standardized **resource and noise profiles**,
   * define **frontier-style tension scores** for quantum information processing,
   * and support AI models that must reason about the **feasibility** of quantum computing claims.

When Q031 is reused by other problems (such as Q052, Q059, Q121, Q123, Q124), it only constrains their **effective-layer feasibility judgments**. It does not fix the truth values of their canonical statements and does not resolve their underlying open problems.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records Q031’s position in the BlackHole adjacency structure. Edges are annotated with one-line reasons that refer to concrete components or tension types.

Edges in this block indicate **reuse of effective-layer components**. They do not encode any logical implication about the truth or falsity of canonical problem statements.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites, tools, or frameworks that Q031 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q026 · Quantum measurement problem (BH_PHYS_QM_MEAS_L3_026)
  Reason: supplies effective-layer treatment of measurement, decoherence, and classical outcomes, which define what counts as a successful “logical operation”.

* Q032 · Quantum foundations of thermodynamics (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: provides thermodynamic and entropic constraints that limit energy and entropy budgets in quantum information processing.

* Q035 · Exact quantum metrology limits (BH_PHYS_QMETROLOGY_LIMIT_L3_035)
  Reason: gives formal examples of “ultimate limit” statements in a neighboring domain (metrology), informing how Q031 should encode similar limits for computation.

* Q052 · P vs BQP / role of quantum computers (BH_CS_PVSBPP_L3_052)
  Reason: anchors complexity-theoretic background that constrains which computational advantages are physically meaningful and avoids encoding obviously unphysical advantages.

* Q059 · Thermodynamic cost of information processing (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: general Landauer-style bounds from Q059 are reused and specialized to realistic quantum devices in Q031.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These directly reuse Q031 components or depend on its frontier curves at the effective layer.

* Q052 · P vs BQP / role of quantum computers (BH_CS_PVSBPP_L3_052)
  Reason: reuses Q031’s `QInfoFrontierFunctional` when relating abstract complexity classes to physically realizable architectures.

* Q059 · Thermodynamic cost of information processing (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: uses Q031’s resource profile fields to extend thermodynamic cost analyses into quantum hardware scenarios.

* Q121 · AI alignment problem (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)
  Reason: uses Q031’s bounds to constrain capability projections and risk models that assume arbitrarily fast or arbitrarily large quantum computation.

* Q123 · Scalable interpretability (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: reuses Q031’s cost and frontier curves to estimate feasibility of interpretability schemes that depend on heavy quantum computation.

* Q124 · Scalable oversight and evaluation (BH_AI_OVERSIGHT_L3_124)
  Reason: uses Q031’s tension score to evaluate whether proposed oversight pipelines relying on quantum accelerators are physically realistic.

* Q125 · Multi agent AI dynamics (BH_AI_MULTIAGENT_L3_125)
  Reason: uses Q031-style resource and frontier constraints to bound cumulative quantum computation across multiple agents.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types and frontier questions, but no direct component reuse is assumed yet.

* Q035 · Exact quantum metrology limits (BH_PHYS_QMETROLOGY_LIMIT_L3_035)
  Reason: both Q031 and Q035 study “ultimate limits” for quantum tasks; Q035 focuses on estimation, Q031 on general computation.

* Q040 · Black hole information problem (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: both involve trade-offs between information capacity, physical resources, and recoverability under extreme conditions.

* Q051 · P vs NP (BH_CS_PVNP_L3_051)
  Reason: both probe tension between abstract computational difficulty and practical resource constraints, although Q051 is classical and does not depend on Q031 encoding.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

These connect Q031 to problems in other domains that reuse its components.

* Q052 · P vs BQP / role of quantum computers (BH_CS_PVSBPP_L3_052)
  Reason: cross-domain Physics–CS bridge that imports Q031’s physical frontiers into complexity-theoretic discussions.

* Q059 · Thermodynamic cost of information processing (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: uses Q031’s quantum device profiles to ground thermodynamic costs in concrete architectures.

* Q121 · AI alignment problem (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)
  Reason: uses Q031’s physical limits to bound realistic capabilities of aligned and misaligned systems.

* Q124 · Scalable oversight and evaluation (BH_AI_OVERSIGHT_L3_124)
  Reason: reuses Q031 when assessing whether proposed oversight protocols could be run in finite time and energy using quantum hardware.

* Q125 · Multi agent AI dynamics (BH_AI_MULTIAGENT_L3_125)
  Reason: uses Q031-style resource and frontier constraints to keep multi-agent quantum computation within physically plausible bounds.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block lives at the **effective layer**. We describe:

* state space,
* observables and fields,
* mismatch measures and tension ingredients,
* admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do **not** describe any hidden generative rules of TU, nor any explicit mapping from raw laboratory data to deep TU fields. All mappings and functionals here are part of an effective-layer encoding that can be published, examined, and falsified.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a state space:

```txt
M
```

where each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent effective description of a quantum information processing setup at a given resolution.

Each `m` encodes:

* an architecture summary:

  * effective number of physical qubits,
  * layout and connectivity graph,
  * available gate set and control channels,
* a noise and decoherence summary:

  * effective local noise channels with parameters such as error probabilities and correlation lengths,
  * leakage rates and non computational errors,
* a resource budget:

  * available energy,
  * average and peak power,
  * total operation time,
  * spatial footprint or volume,
* task and accuracy requirements:

  * a summary of the intended algorithm or task family,
  * target logical error rates or success probabilities,
  * required throughput or total number of logical operations.

No assumption is made about how `m` is constructed from detailed experimental or design data. The encoding only requires that for any device and task of interest there exists at least one effective description `m` in `M` that captures the relevant summaries.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables on `M`.

1. Resource profile field

```txt
R_comp(m) = (Q_phys, Q_log, T_total, P_avg, A_footprint, D_depth)
```

* `Q_phys`: effective count of physical qubits.
* `Q_log`: effective count of logical qubits.
* `T_total`: total allowed wall-clock time for the computation.
* `P_avg`: average power budget over the computation.
* `A_footprint`: effective area or volume of the device.
* `D_depth`: effective logical circuit depth or number of logical time steps.

Each component is a nonnegative real value. The tuple can be extended with additional entries, as long as they remain finite and well defined.

2. Noise and decoherence field

```txt
E_noise(m) = (p_local, tau_coh, L_corr, p_leak, p_gate)
```

* `p_local`: typical local error probability per physical time step.
* `tau_coh`: characteristic coherence time.
* `L_corr`: characteristic spatial or temporal correlation length of noise.
* `p_leak`: effective probability of leakage out of the computational subspace.
* `p_gate`: effective average gate implementation error.

All entries are nonnegative and finite in the regular domain.

3. Task complexity profile

```txt
C_task(m) = (N_log_ops, D_req, S_ent)
```

* `N_log_ops`: required number of logical operations for the target task.
* `D_req`: required logical depth.
* `S_ent`: a coarse measure of entanglement structure, such as a typical entanglement width or another complexity proxy.

The exact definitions may vary within the admissible encoding class, but they must be consistent, finite, and reproducible.

4. Physical limit proximity field

```txt
B_limit(m) = (b_speed, b_energy, b_entropy)
```

* `b_speed`: dimensionless measure of how close the device is to a relevant quantum speed limit.
* `b_energy`: dimensionless measure of proximity to minimal energy cost per reliable logical operation.
* `b_entropy`: dimensionless measure of proximity to entropy production bounds, including constraints imposed by error correction overhead.

Each component is designed so that:

* values near `0` indicate operation far below the relevant ultimate limit,
* values near `1` indicate proximity to the limit,
* values above `1` indicate operation beyond the limit within the chosen model.

### 3.3 Mismatch and tension ingredients

We define nonnegative mismatch measures that compare what the device offers with what the task requires and what current physical models allow.

1. Resource mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_res(m) >= 0
```

This scalar mismatch increases when:

* `R_comp(m)` is insufficient to support `C_task(m)` under a chosen admissible set of resource–task scaling rules,
* or when resources are deployed in a way that is dominated by a less costly point on the same frontier, within the same encoding.

2. Noise mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_noise(m) >= 0
```

This scalar mismatch increases when:

* `E_noise(m)` is too adverse to maintain required logical error rates for the given `C_task(m)` and `R_comp(m)`,
* according to an admissible fault-tolerance model that respects known threshold theorems and overhead scaling.

3. Limit proximity mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_bound(m) >= 0
```

This scalar mismatch increases when:

* components of `B_limit(m)` approach or exceed unity,
* meaning operation is at or beyond the presumed fundamental limits in speed, energy, or entropy within the current physical model.

All mismatch terms are finite in the regular domain and vanish only in idealized or near-ideal configurations according to the chosen encoding instance. They are functions of effective summaries and do not depend on any hidden deep TU fields.

### 3.4 Hybrid structure and scale parameters

Although the metadata marks the semantics as hybrid, all quantities used in mismatch definitions are treated through:

* finite-dimensional real vectors for continuous aspects, and
* finite libraries of discrete types for categorical aspects, such as:

  * error-correcting code families,
  * gate sets,
  * architecture templates.

We assume the existence of finite libraries:

```txt
L_arch  = { encode_arch_j }
L_noise = { encode_noise_j }
L_task  = { encode_task_j }
```

Each library element maps detailed device or task descriptions into:

* `R_comp(m)` for architectures,
* `E_noise(m)` for noise models,
* `C_task(m)` for task summaries.

For any given encoding instance, one choice from each library is fixed and then used consistently across all datasets.

We also introduce a discrete refinement parameter:

```txt
r in N
```

This refinement parameter controls how finely:

```txt
R_comp_r(m), E_noise_r(m), B_limit_r(m)
```

are estimated. As `r` increases within the defined range:

* the estimates become more detailed or more accurate,
* mismatch measures

  ```txt
  DeltaS_res_r(m)
  DeltaS_noise_r(m)
  DeltaS_bound_r(m)
  ```

  remain well defined, and satisfy monotonicity or boundedness conditions compatible with the idea of approaching ultimate limits.

### 3.5 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

To prevent retrospective tailoring of Q031 to desired conclusions, we define an admissible encoding class `Enc_Q031` with explicit fairness constraints.

1. Finite frontier library

There exists a fixed finite library:

```txt
L_frontier = { F_k : k in K_frontier }
```

of frontier functions and parameterizations used in the definitions of `DeltaS_res_r`, `DeltaS_noise_r`, and `DeltaS_bound_r`. The index set `K_frontier` is finite and chosen before any Q031-related experiments are specified.

2. Fixed weight vector

We define a fixed weight vector:

```txt
w = (w_res, w_noise, w_bound)
```

with:

```txt
w_res   > 0
w_noise > 0
w_bound > 0
w_res + w_noise + w_bound = 1
```

For a given encoding instance in `Enc_Q031`, the weight vector `w` is chosen based on general considerations about the relative importance of resources, noise, and physical limits. Once chosen and published, it is not adjusted in response to specific experimental outcomes.

3. Non adaptive rule

For a given encoding instance in `Enc_Q031`:

* the choice of `encode_arch`, `encode_noise`, `encode_task`, and `F_k` from `L_frontier` must be made **before** any Q031-specific datasets are inspected,
* these choices must depend only on public theory, design goals, and generic considerations,
  not on the measured performance of particular devices under evaluation,
* after publication, these choices are held fixed for all experiments used to assess Q031 tension in that instance.

4. Refinement behaviour

For each admissible encoding, and for each refinement level `r` in a specified range:

* `R_comp_r(m)`, `E_noise_r(m)`, and `B_limit_r(m)` are well defined,
* the associated mismatch functions `DeltaS_res_r(m)`, `DeltaS_noise_r(m)`, `DeltaS_bound_r(m)` obey simple regularity properties, such as:

  * no uncontrolled oscillation in sign,
  * no arbitrary dependence on irrelevant detail as `r` increases.

A candidate encoding that violates these regularity conditions is rejected as part of `Enc_Q031`.

For Q031, any encoding instance that violates these regularity conditions is declared invalid for evaluation and must not be used to assign tension values.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states in `M` may produce undefined or divergent mismatch values, for instance when a device description is inconsistent or incomplete. We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           at least one of DeltaS_res(m),
                        DeltaS_noise(m),
                        DeltaS_bound(m)
           is undefined or not finite }
```

We then restrict attention to the regular subset:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All tension-related statements, definitions, and experiments in this file are to be interpreted as operating on `M_reg`.

When an experimental procedure encounters a state in `S_sing`:

* the result is recorded as “out of domain for Q031”,
* it is **not** interpreted as evidence that the physical device, task, or theory is inconsistent.

The singular set is only a boundary of applicability for this effective-layer encoding, not a verdict on the underlying physics.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q031 is characterized as a tension problem in TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

For each refinement level `r`, we define the effective Q031 tension functional:

```txt
Tension_Qinfo_r(m) =
    w_res   * DeltaS_res_r(m)   +
    w_noise * DeltaS_noise_r(m) +
    w_bound * DeltaS_bound_r(m)
```

where:

* `m` lies in `M_reg`,
* `r` is the refinement level,
* `w_res`, `w_noise`, `w_bound` are the fixed weights from Section 3.5.

We then define an aggregate tension at a chosen reference refinement level `r_star` by:

```txt
Tension_Qinfo(m) = Tension_Qinfo_r_star(m)
```

with `r_star` selected to be high enough to capture relevant trade-offs but still practically estimable.

Properties:

* `Tension_Qinfo(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_reg`,
* `Tension_Qinfo(m)` is small when resources, noise, and physical limits are jointly favourable for the target task under the encoding,
* `Tension_Qinfo(m)` grows when any mismatch term grows, if the others are held fixed.

The functional `Tension_Qinfo` belongs entirely to the effective layer and does not depend on deep TU fields.

### 4.2 Low-tension regime: feasible and physically modest devices

At the effective layer, we say a state `m` representing a device–task pair is in the low-tension regime if:

```txt
Tension_Qinfo(m) <= epsilon_Q031
```

for a fixed threshold `epsilon_Q031` defined as part of the encoding instance at level `r_star`.

Informally, in the low-tension regime:

* resource budgets comfortably cover the task demands under known fault-tolerance and scaling rules,
* noise levels are within reach of available error correction without extreme overhead,
* operation stays safely below current models of speed, energy, and entropy bounds.

Q031 treats low-tension device–task pairs as well within the space of physically plausible quantum information processors for the purposes of this encoding.

### 4.3 High-tension regime: edge-of-limit or unrealistic claims

We say a state `m` is in the high-tension regime if:

```txt
Tension_Qinfo(m) >= delta_Q031
```

for some `delta_Q031` that is strictly larger than `epsilon_Q031`.

In this regime at least one of the mismatch terms is significantly large:

* resource mismatch, or
* noise mismatch, or
* limit proximity mismatch.

High tension indicates that, under the current encoding and physical understanding:

* the device–task configuration is pushing very close to known or conjectured limits,
* or it is implicitly relying on a violation of those limits.

High tension does **not** automatically certify impossibility. It means:

* within this encoding, such a configuration would require extreme engineering or new physics to realize in a robust way.

### 4.4 Frontier curve interpretation and refinement stability

Q031 can be viewed through frontier curves in the space:

```txt
(R_comp, E_noise, C_task, B_limit)
```

An encoding in `Enc_Q031` specifies a family of frontier curves such that:

* low tension corresponds to states on or below these frontiers,
* high tension corresponds to states that lie significantly beyond them.

Refinement stability requirements:

* as the refinement parameter `r` increases within the admissible range, the low-tension region should not collapse or jump erratically,
* changes in tension under refinement should be explainable by standard modelling effects,
  not by arbitrary dependence on encoding details that were unconstrained at the design stage.

Within this viewpoint, “ultimate limits of quantum information processing” become questions about:

* the shape and stability of frontier curves under refinement, and
* the impossibility, under fixed physical laws and admissible encodings, of pushing these frontiers arbitrarily far without triggering persistent high tension.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds strictly at the effective layer:

* World T: a world where currently known physical theories, applied in a standard way, already encode the true ultimate limits for quantum information processing.
* World F: a world where there exist physically realizable devices that systematically and robustly surpass these limits, as they are currently encoded.

This file does not state which world is actual. Both are used as reference frames for interpreting tension patterns.

### 5.1 World T: standard-limit world

In World T:

1. Stability of frontiers

   For world-representing states `m_T` in `M_reg`, as the refinement parameter `r` increases within the admissible range, the tension functional satisfies:

   ```txt
   Tension_Qinfo_r(m_T) <= epsilon_Q031(r)
   ```

   where `epsilon_Q031(r)` is a slowly varying function that does not grow without bound and remains compatible with known lower bounds, thresholds, and trade-offs.

2. Consistency across platforms

   * Different device architectures and hardware platforms, when mapped through admissible encodings, yield frontiers that are consistent up to model and measurement uncertainty.
   * No family of realistic devices exhibits a sustained pattern of significantly lower tension than what the frontier curves allow.

3. Trade-off patterns

   * Attempts to push one resource dimension closer to its limit (for instance speed) lead to compensating increases in tension through other dimensions (for instance energy cost or noise).
   * These trade-offs can be expressed in terms of `DeltaS_res`, `DeltaS_noise`, and `DeltaS_bound`, and they remain within physically plausible ranges.

### 5.2 World F: beyond-limit world

In World F:

1. Systematic frontier violations

   There exist device families and tasks such that their world-representing states `m_F` in `M_reg` satisfy:

   ```txt
   Tension_Qinfo_r(m_F) < epsilon_Q031(r)
   ```

   for refinement levels where, under the standard-limit view, one would predict:

   ```txt
   Tension_Qinfo_r(m_F) >= delta_Q031(r)
   ```

   with `delta_Q031(r)` significantly larger than `epsilon_Q031(r)`.

2. Robustness of violations

   * These unexpectedly low-tension assignments persist under multiple admissible encodings within `Enc_Q031`,
   * and across independent measurement campaigns and modelling choices.
   * They cannot be explained away by reasonable uncertainty in mapping data into `R_comp`, `E_noise`, or `B_limit`.

3. New-physics interpretation

   The most direct interpretation of sustained frontier violations in World F is that:

   * the assumed physical theories, or their application to the device class, are incomplete or inaccurate for those regimes.

   Q031 does not specify the nature of such new physics. It only encodes how their presence would manifest in Q031 tension patterns.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

The role of World T and World F in this file is:

* to clarify what kinds of empirical patterns would push us toward revising Q031 encodings,
* and to distinguish between:

  * evidence that calls for adjusting the encoding within the same physical theory, and
  * evidence that points toward deeper changes in our understanding of physical limits.

This file does **not** endorse World T or World F as the true description of our universe. It also does not treat any pattern of Q031 tension values as proof of a complexity-theoretic separation or collapse. Evidence that favours World F over World T would falsify some assumptions in the Q031 encoding or in its underlying physical model; it would not by itself settle any canonical open problem.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block defines experiment patterns that can falsify or refine specific Q031 encodings at the effective layer.

* None of these experiments can by itself “solve” Q031.
* Each experiment can only accept or reject **encoding instances** in `Enc_Q031`, or shift their parameter choices within the admissible space.

The correct conclusion when falsification conditions are met is:

* “this encoding instance of Q031 is rejected or must be revised”,

not

* “ultimate limits have been proven or disproven”.

### Experiment 1: Fault-tolerance frontier mapping

**Goal**

Probe whether the Q031 encoding of resource and noise mismatch can produce a stable frontier across multiple quantum hardware platforms.

**Setup**

* Collect data from several physical platforms, for example:

  * trapped ions,
  * superconducting qubits,
  * neutral atoms.
* For each platform and protocol, estimate:

  * `R_comp(m_data)`,
  * `E_noise(m_data)`,
  * achieved logical error rates for relevant `C_task(m_data)`.

**Protocol**

1. Fix an admissible encoding instance in `Enc_Q031`:

   * choose `encode_arch`, `encode_noise`, `encode_task`,
   * choose a frontier function `F_k` in `L_frontier`,
   * choose fixed weights `w_res`, `w_noise`, `w_bound`.

2. For each experimental configuration, construct a state `m_data` in `M_reg` encoding the observed summaries.

3. Compute for a chosen refinement level `r = r_star`:

   * `DeltaS_res_r(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_noise_r(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_bound_r(m_data)`,

   and then `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)`.

4. Identify a low-tension band that approximates the inferred frontier. Compare how different platforms populate this band.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` over all configurations and platforms.
* Stability of the inferred frontier band across hardware families.
* Sensitivity of the tension distribution to small changes in encoding parameters within `Enc_Q031`.

**Falsification conditions**

If, for every admissible encoding instance in `Enc_Q031`, one of the following holds:

* tension values for similar operating points on different platforms are inconsistent in ways that cannot be attributed to measurement and modelling uncertainty, or
* small, precommitted changes in encoding parameters within `Enc_Q031` lead to arbitrary reshaping of the frontier band without clear physical justification,

then the current Q031 encoding is considered falsified at the effective layer.

If configurations that are widely regarded as practically infeasible, for example due to prohibitive overhead, systematically receive lower tension than configurations regarded as near-feasible, the encoding is considered misaligned and must be revised or rejected.

Falsifying an encoding in this sense does **not** demonstrate that any physical limit has been broken. It only shows that this particular effective-layer encoding does not track empirical feasibility in a coherent way.

### Experiment 2: Energetic cost of reliable logical operations

**Goal**

Test whether the Q031 encoding of `DeltaS_bound` (via `B_limit`) is compatible with observed energy and entropy costs of reliable logical operations on existing devices.

**Setup**

For several device–task pairs, measure or estimate:

* average power usage and total energy consumed,
* number of logical operations performed,
* achieved logical error rate,
* rough entropy production, where feasible.

Map these observations to `R_comp(m_data)`, `E_noise(m_data)`, and `B_limit(m_data)` using a fixed admissible encoding in `Enc_Q031`.

**Protocol**

1. Fix a specific encoding instance in `Enc_Q031` and a refinement level `r_star`.

2. For each device–task pair, construct a state `m_data` in `M_reg`.

3. Compute:

   * `DeltaS_res_r(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_noise_r(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_bound_r(m_data)`,

   and then `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)`.

4. Compare observed tension values with predicted bands based on theoretical lower bounds for energy and entropy per reliable logical operation.

**Metrics**

* Ratio of observed energy per logical operation to the bound used in `B_limit(m_data)`.
* Distribution of `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` over the dataset.
* Presence or absence of configurations with sustained very low tension close to assumed lower bounds.

**Falsification conditions**

If there exist many configurations where:

* observed energy and entropy use are significantly lower than any plausible bound encoded in `B_limit(m_data)`, by a margin that cannot be explained by modelling error or uncertainty, and
* yet `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` remains high due to an incongruent definition of `DeltaS_bound`,

then the current definition of `DeltaS_bound` is considered falsified at the effective layer.

If, under all reasonable settings within `Enc_Q031`, the encoding labels almost all real devices as extremely high tension despite them being considered practical or near-term feasible by the community, Q031 is considered too conservative and its encoding must be revised.

Again, falsifying `DeltaS_bound` in this way means rejecting a particular effective-layer parametrization. It does not show that any deep physical law has been violated.

### Experiment 3: Quantum speed limits versus achievable throughput

**Goal**

Compare achievable gate speeds and coherent operation times with theoretical quantum speed limits, and test whether Q031’s tension functional can consistently describe their relationship.

**Setup**

* Gather experimental or design data on:

  * maximum gate speeds,
  * coherence times,
  * operation fidelities,
  * for different architectures and tasks.
* Derive estimates of speed limit quantities and map them into components of `B_limit(m_data)`.

**Protocol**

1. Fix an encoding instance in `Enc_Q031` and a refinement level `r_star`.

2. Construct states `m_data` in `M_reg` for each configuration.

3. Evaluate `DeltaS_bound_r(m_data)` with particular focus on `b_speed`.

4. Compute `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` and examine how closely achievable throughputs approach encoded speed limits.

**Metrics**

* Ratio of actual gate time to minimal time suggested by speed limit estimates.
* Distribution of `b_speed` and `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` across configurations.
* Correlation between attempts to increase throughput and increases in other mismatch terms, especially `DeltaS_noise_r(m_data)`.

**Falsification conditions**

If realistic devices appear to operate significantly beyond the encoded speed limits, yet remain low-error and low-energy, and this pattern persists across:

* multiple independent data sources,
* multiple encoding choices within `Enc_Q031`,

then the speed-related components of `B_limit` and `DeltaS_bound` are considered falsified.

If the encoding systematically misranks device configurations, for example by labeling clearly slower architectures as closer to speed limits than faster ones under similar conditions, the speed-related part of Q031 is considered misaligned and must be revised.

As before, such falsification affects the encoding and its parameterization. It does not constitute proof that any deep physical speed limit has been overcome.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block specifies how Q031 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within WFGY at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals derived from Q031 fields and tension scores.

1. `signal_qinfo_tension_scalar`

   * Definition: for contexts where a device–task description is present, compute or estimate `Tension_Qinfo(m)` and provide it as an auxiliary scalar label.
   * Purpose: encourage models to distinguish low-tension, feasible quantum computing claims from high-tension, unrealistic ones.

2. `signal_qinfo_feasibility_label`

   * Definition: a coarse classification derived from `Tension_Qinfo(m)` into classes such as:

     * “below frontier”,
     * “near frontier”,
     * “beyond frontier”.
   * Purpose: help models learn to answer feasibility questions about quantum architectures with realistic caution.

3. `signal_qinfo_tradeoff_awareness`

   * Definition: a signal that penalizes descriptions which implicitly demand simultaneous extreme optimisation of speed, error rate, and energy in ways that would produce large `DeltaS_res`, `DeltaS_noise`, and `DeltaS_bound` under any admissible encoding.
   * Purpose: encourage models to surface trade-offs explicitly, instead of implicitly ignoring them.

4. `signal_qinfo_consistency_under_refinement`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how the model’s feasibility judgments change when the same device–task description is presented at different resolution levels, mimicking changes in the refinement parameter `r`.
   * Purpose: promote stable, refinement-aware reasoning about ultimate limits.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

Q031 suggests the following module patterns for AI systems.

1. `QInfoLimitHead`

   * Role: given a structured or textual description of a quantum computing proposal, estimate `Tension_Qinfo(m)` and its decomposition into mismatch terms.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: embeddings summarizing `R_comp`, `E_noise`, `C_task`, `B_limit`.
     * Outputs: scalar tension estimate and a vector of component scores corresponding to `DeltaS_res`, `DeltaS_noise`, and `DeltaS_bound`.

2. `QDeviceProfileExtractor`

   * Role: map natural language or structured specifications of a quantum device into an internal representation consistent with `QDeviceResourceProfile`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: device description text, configuration parameters, or schematic information.
     * Outputs: internal profile representing `R_comp(m)` and `E_noise(m)`.

3. `FrontierCritic`

   * Role: act as a critic that flags device or algorithm proposals landing in high-tension regimes under Q031.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: candidate design plus its internal profile.
     * Outputs: warning signals and suggested directions to reduce tension, such as:

       * relax performance targets,
       * increase resources,
       * accept higher error rates,
       * or reframe the task.

Q031-based modules constrain how AI systems **reason and speak** about physical feasibility. They do not grant the system any new physical capabilities and do not allow it to circumvent real-world resource or noise constraints.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness to measure the impact of Q031-based modules.

1. Task selection

   Use benchmarks or curated sets of problems where models must:

   * judge feasibility of hypothetical quantum computing proposals,
   * distinguish near-term experimental roadmaps from highly speculative claims,
   * reason about resource scaling and error correction overhead in realistic terms.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * model without Q031-specific heads, trained in a generic way.
   * TU condition:

     * the same model architecture, augmented with Q031-based signals and modules,
     * trained with additional loss terms that depend on `Tension_Qinfo(m)` and its components.

3. Metrics

   * feasibility classification accuracy on held-out scenarios labelled by domain experts,
   * consistency of judgments under different phrasings of the same device–task description,
   * reduction in obviously unphysical or over-optimistic designs that the model endorses,
   * clarity of trade-off explanations in model outputs.

### 7.4 60-second reproduction protocol

This protocol gives external users a quick way to experience the effect of Q031-based reasoning in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt:

    > Given this hypothetical quantum computer design and target algorithm, explain whether it seems feasible in the next few decades.

  * Observation:

    * Does the answer ignore resource and noise details,
    * or does it lack explicit trade-off analysis,
    * or does it casually accept designs that are widely seen as unrealistic?

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt:

    > Using the Q031 quantum information tension frontier, evaluate this hypothetical quantum computer design. Explicitly discuss resources, noise, and physical limits, and give a qualitative tension score.

  * Observation:

    * Does the answer identify which aspects of the design push against known limits,
    * does it articulate concrete trade-offs,
    * does it give a structured feasibility assessment that separates low-tension and high-tension features?

* Comparison metric

  * Human raters score both answers on:

    * explicitness of trade-offs,
    * physical plausibility,
    * consistency with known thresholds and trends,
    * and clarity about what remains unknown or conjectural.

* What to log

  * Prompts and responses for both setups,
  * any internal Q031 tension scores or component estimates used by the model,
  * enough metadata to allow external audit of how Q031 impacted the answer, without revealing any deep TU fields.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block states Q031’s current verification and narrative levels and outlines next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  * An effective-layer encoding for Q031 is specified, with:

    * state space `M`,
    * fields `R_comp`, `E_noise`, `C_task`, `B_limit`,
    * mismatch measures `DeltaS_res`, `DeltaS_noise`, `DeltaS_bound`,
    * a tension functional `Tension_Qinfo(m)`,
    * an admissible encoding class `Enc_Q031`,
    * a singular set `S_sing` and regular domain `M_reg`.
  * Finite libraries and frontier functions are defined conceptually and can be instantiated with concrete choices, but have not yet been tied to a fully implemented, publicly audited dataset and codebase.

* **N_level: N2**

  * The narrative linking device physics, resource trade-offs, noise, and physical limits is explicit and internally coherent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds World T and World F have been outlined in terms of tension patterns.
  * The distinction between falsifying encodings and settling canonical problems is clearly stated.

E_level and N_level are verification and narrative levels in TU’s effective-layer hierarchy. They do not imply any result at the level of fundamental axioms or deep TU fields.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2 and beyond

To upgrade Q031 from E1 to E2, the following steps are proposed:

1. Implement a concrete library of encoding functions and frontier candidates:

   * specific forms for `F_k` in `L_frontier`,
   * explicit mappings for `encode_arch`, `encode_noise`, `encode_task`,
   * concrete choices of weights `w_res`, `w_noise`, `w_bound`,
   * and explicit thresholds `epsilon_Q031` and `delta_Q031`.

2. Execute at least one experiment pattern from Section 6 on real or simulated data:

   * compute `Tension_Qinfo(m_data)` for a nontrivial set of device–task pairs,
   * publish the corresponding tension profiles and frontier bands,
   * make the code and data available for external audit.

3. Document how different admissible encodings within `Enc_Q031` shift or stabilise the inferred limits:

   * which patterns are robust under encoding variation,
   * which features are sensitive to particular modelling decisions.

Further upgrades (E3 and higher) would require:

* significant empirical coverage across multiple platforms,
* robust cross-checking by independent teams,
* demonstration that Q031’s encoding provides useful predictive structure for future devices and tasks.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

Long term, Q031 is intended to:

* serve as the reference node for **physical limits to computation** within TU,
* provide a common language for relating:

  * hardware roadmaps,
  * complexity-theoretic conjectures,
  * AI capability and safety forecasts,
* act as a bridge between:

  * quantum device engineering,
  * thermodynamics and metrology,
  * and safety-oriented questions about large-scale AI systems.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non technical explanation aligned with the effective-layer description.

Imagine designing a quantum computer that should solve very hard problems. You always face three big questions.

1. Do you have enough physical resources?

   * enough qubits,
   * enough time,
   * enough control hardware and space.

2. Can you keep the system quiet and controlled enough?

   * low enough noise,
   * long enough coherence,
   * error correction that can actually keep up with the errors.

3. Are you staying within the basic rules of physics?

   * you do not ask for arbitrarily high speed at fixed energy,
   * you do not ask for almost zero energy cost with perfect reliability,
   * you do not ignore thermodynamic constraints on entropy and heat.

Q031 asks:

> If we look at all these aspects together, what are the limits on what any quantum computer can do, under known physics?

In the Tension Universe viewpoint, we do not try to prove a single formula that says “this is the final limit”. Instead, Q031:

* describes a space of “device–worlds”,
* assigns to each one a **tension score** that:

  * is small when the design looks feasible and physically modest,
  * is large when the design looks extreme or would need new physics to work.

The boundary between low-tension and high-tension designs is the **frontier** of quantum information processing in this encoding.

* In one kind of world, this frontier mostly matches what we already expect from quantum theory and thermodynamics.
* In another kind of world, experiments might show that devices can run faster, cheaper, or more reliably than we thought possible. That would tell us that our frontier, or our use of physics, is incomplete.

Q031 does not claim to know which world we live in. It provides:

* a way to describe devices and tasks in a common language,
* a way to score how close they come to current physical limits,
* and a way to design experiments that test whether this scoring system makes sense.

Nothing in this file should be cited as a proof of any ultimate limit. It is a framework for organising what we know, for making assumptions explicit, and for testing how far different devices can reasonably go without confusing effective-layer tension with solved physics.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** effective-layer S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in physics or complexity theory has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer of TU.
* No deep TU fields, axiom systems, or generative rules are specified in this file.
* Any mapping from raw experimental or design data into the effective-layer quantities is part of the encoding and can be audited and falsified.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding choices described here (libraries, weights, frontier functions, refinement schemes) are intended to be **precommitted** and **non adaptive** with respect to specific datasets used for evaluation.
* Falsification of an encoding instance means:

  * “this particular encoding of Q031 is rejected or must be revised”,
  * not “ultimate limits in the real world have been proven or disproven”.
* Different admissible encodings within `Enc_Q031` may give different tension values, but they must satisfy the fairness and stability constraints stated in this file and in the global encoding charter.

### Tension scale and interpretation

* Tension values such as `Tension_Qinfo(m)` are **dimensionless indicators** of how strongly a scenario strains the encoding, not direct physical observables.
* Low tension indicates that a scenario is comfortably inside the plausible region for a given encoding.
* High tension indicates that a scenario is at or beyond the edge of what the encoding can reconcile with current physical models.
* Crossing a tension threshold does not automatically certify physical impossibility. It marks a region where new evidence or new physics would be required to sustain the claim.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
