When to use this folder:
metrics look unstable between runs
coverage looks high but answers still drift
delta s changes across paraphrases or seeds
lambda flips divergent after small edits
benchmarks regress without any code change
long run eval shows gradual decline in quality
alerts missing when metrics cross thresholds
local eval passes but ci fails inconsistently
variance across seeds is higher than expected
no clear target for delta s thresholds
no agreement on acceptable coverage levels
no guardrail on drift across eval windows

Key metrics and targets:
delta s question retrieved <= 0.45
coverage to target section >= 0.70
lambda observe convergent across 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds
variance ratio across seeds <= 0.15
no downward drift beyond 3 eval windows
e_resonance flat or within tolerance on long evals
alerts configured for delta s >= 0.60
alerts configured when lambda diverges or drift slope > 0.02

Evaluation scenarios:
benchmarks regress with no code change
metrics fluctuate but there are no alerts
coverage high on paper but not semantic
delta s thresholds chosen without evidence
lambda flips on harmless prompt edits
variance high between seeds or runs
no eval_contract yaml or versioned config
no trace of which eval suite was used
cannot replay a failing eval case from logs
no drift window or history across runs

Signals to check:
delta s per item across windows and seeds
coverage against gold snippet or section
lambda observe state across paraphrases
variance ratio across seeds and models
drift slope across eval windows
e_resonance across long context runs
alert counts vs threshold crossings
missing or incomplete metrics in logs

This folder provides **guardrails for evaluation and observability** in RAG and agent pipelines.  
It shows how to catch silent drift, regressions, and unstable metrics before they break your system.

---

## What this folder is
- A starter kit to make evals predictable and repeatable.
- Guardrails for metrics, variance, and drift detection.
- Copy-paste probes and configs you can add to your pipeline.
- Acceptance targets you can actually measure and enforce.

---

## When to use
- Metrics look **unstable** between runs.  
- Coverage seems high but answers still drift.  
- ΔS changes across paraphrases or seeds.  
- λ flips divergent after harmless edits.  
- Benchmarks regress without any code change.  
- Long-run evals show a slow decline.

---

## Acceptance targets
- **ΔS(question, retrieved) ≤ 0.45**  
- **Coverage ≥ 0.70** to target section  
- **λ remains convergent** across 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds  
- **Variance ratio ≤ 0.15** across seeds  
- **No downward drift** beyond 3 eval windows  
- **E_resonance stays flat** on long evals

## Copy-paste eval contract

```yaml
eval_contract:
  seeds: 3
  paraphrases: 3
  targets:
    deltaS: <=0.45
    coverage: >=0.70
    lambda: convergent
    variance: <=0.15
    drift: <=0.02
alerts:
  - deltaS >=0.60
  - lambda divergent
  - drift slope >0.02

## FAQ

**Q: What if my metrics vary a lot each run?**
A: Check [variance\_and\_drift.md](./variance_and_drift.md). Add more seeds and enforce variance ≤0.15.

**Q: My eval passes locally but fails in CI — why?**
A: See [metrics\_and\_logging.md](./metrics_and_logging.md). Local runs often miss logging detail. CI must enforce the same eval contract.

**Q: What if coverage is high but the answer is still wrong?**
A: Open [coverage\_tracking.md](./coverage_tracking.md). You might be measuring snippet recall, not semantic coverage. Switch to ΔS-based coverage.

**Q: ΔS is always drifting, even on simple questions.**
A: Look at [deltaS\_thresholds.md](./deltaS_thresholds.md). Adjust thresholds and clamp variance with λ probes.

**Q: How do I stop regressions before release?**
A: Use [regression\_gate.md](./regression_gate.md). It defines pass/fail rules so bad models never ship.
