## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We specify only:

  * the effective state space `M_dev` and its regular subset,
  * finite libraries of modules and an admissible encoding class,
  * observable maps, invariants, and tension functionals,
  * counterfactual worlds and experiment templates expressed in terms of these observables.
* We do not define or select any bottom layer TU axiom system, generative rule, or unique constructive mechanism.
* We do not provide any mapping from raw biological data (sequences, molecular states, developmental trajectories) to hypothetical bottom layer TU objects.
* The canonical genotype to phenotype problem remains an open scientific question in biology and related fields. This document only describes how a family of TU style encodings can organise and test related observations at the effective layer.
* Falsifying or supporting a particular encoding instance `E*` for Q078 does not prove or refute any canonical theorem. It only constrains which TU style effective descriptions of the genotype to phenotype map are compatible with specific datasets and experiment designs.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q078 is to understand, at a scientific and engineering level, how genetic information, regulatory systems, and environments jointly determine organismal phenotypes.

In classical terms:

* The genotype is the heritable specification, for example genomic sequence and its structural organization.
* The phenotype is the realized structure and function of an organism at one or more scales, including morphology, physiology, and behavior.
* The genotype to phenotype map is the collection of regularities that link variation in genotype and environment to variation in phenotype through development.

Key questions include:

* How structured and low dimensional this map becomes once expressed in appropriate variables.
* How robustness and modularity emerge from underlying biochemical and developmental dynamics.
* To what extent the map can be compressed into reusable principles, rather than being effectively idiosyncratic for each organism and context.

Q078 does not attempt to solve these biological questions inside TU. Instead it encodes them at the effective layer in terms of observable maps, robustness, and consistency tension between genetic information and realized phenotype.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

From the external scientific viewpoint:

* There is no universally accepted, complete theory of the genotype to phenotype map, even for well studied model organisms.
* There are strong partial theories, such as:

  * gene regulatory networks and developmental pathways,
  * quantitative genetics and statistical models of trait architecture,
  * evo devo accounts of modularity, robustness, and innovation,
  * systems biology descriptions of multiscale regulation.

However:

* The mapping is high dimensional, context dependent, and strongly shaped by development and environment.
* Many observed traits are influenced by large numbers of loci and interactions.
* For complex traits, predictive power from genotype alone is often limited or fragile.

This makes Q078 an S rank problem in the BlackHole collection. It is not a single conjecture like Q001, but a structural question about whether the genotype to phenotype map admits a low tension, reusable effective description.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q078 plays three roles:

1. It is the primary biological node where genetic information, development, and environment are tied together into a single effective map.
2. It anchors a cluster of downstream problems about aging, microbiomes, origin of eukaryotes, and biosphere level adaptability that all depend on how structured or brittle this map is.
3. It provides a biological template for TU style consistency_tension between low level codes and emergent configurations that can be reused in neuroscience and AI interpretability.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records Q078 as a node in the BlackHole graph. Each edge has a single line reason and points to planned components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites or tools for Q078 at the effective layer.

* Q071 `BH_BIO_ORIGIN_L3_071`
  Reason: supplies origin of self replicating informational systems that make genotype spaces meaningful for the `DevMap_field`.

* Q072 `BH_BIO_GENETIC_CODE_L3_072`
  Reason: fixes the basic symbolic mapping from codons to amino acids that underlies all later genotype to phenotype encodings.

* Q074 `BH_BIO_CELL_DIFFER_L3_074`
  Reason: provides mechanisms of cell fate and differentiation that act as local modules inside the global genotype to phenotype map.

* Q076 `BH_BIO_IMMUNE_CODE_L3_076`
  Reason: contributes examples of highly plastic but rule governed mappings in somatic diversification and immune repertoires.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These reuse components of Q078 or depend on its tension structure.

* Q075 `BH_BIO_AGING_L3_075`
  Reason: reuses `DevMap_field` and `DevMap_tension_functional` to study how genotype to phenotype mappings deform along aging trajectories.

* Q077 `BH_BIO_MICROBIOME_L3_077`

* Q079 `BH_BIO_ORIGIN_EUKARYOTES_L3_079`
  Reason: builds on `DevMap_field` to understand how compartment structure and endosymbiosis reshape genotype to phenotype mappings.

* Q080 `BH_BIO_BIOSPHERE_LIMITS_L3_080`
  Reason: uses `DevMap_tension_functional` as part of its adaptability descriptors that relate genomic diversity to phenotypic range and biosphere level limits.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types without direct component dependence.

* Q063 `BH_CHEM_PROTEIN_FOLDING_L3_063`
  Reason: both address maps from sequence space to structured functional states under map complexity and energy landscape tension.

* Q083 `BH_NEURO_CODE_L3_083`
  Reason: both encode high dimensional maps from low level codes to emergent functional configurations under consistency_tension.

* Q081 `BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081`
  Reason: both discuss mappings from physical substrates to emergent properties, while Q078 stays at a mechanistic biological layer.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect to other disciplines that reuse Q078 style components.

* Q059 `BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059`
  Reason: relates `DevMap_tension_functional` to information to state tension observables that link coding cost and physical transformations.

* Q031 `BH_PHYS_QINFO_L3_031`
  Reason: shares channel capacity versus robustness style observables for mappings from input information to constrained output states.

* Q123 `BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123`
  Reason: borrows `DevMap_modularity_profile` to interpret internal neural network representations as learned genotype to phenotype like mappings.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We describe only:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

No rules are given for how to construct TU internal fields from raw biological data.

We summarize the encoding for Q078 as a tuple:

```txt
E_dev = (D, F, W, L)
```

where:

* `D` is a family of data maps that send raw biological inputs to effective states in `M_dev` and to library indices.
* `F` is a set of effective observables and fields, including coherence, robustness, modularity, mismatch, and tension functionals.
* `W` is a parameter set that contains finite libraries, refinement indices, perturbation schemes, thresholds, band libraries, and constants.
* `L` is a list of biological system classes and datasets for which the encoding is declared valid.

A concrete encoding instance is written as:

```txt
E*_dev = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
```

Once an instance `E*_dev` is chosen for a given evaluation or experiment, all components of `D*`, `F*`, `W*`, and `L*` are treated as fixed and auditable.

### 3.1 State space

We introduce an effective developmental state space:

```txt
M_dev
```

Each state `m` in `M_dev` represents a coherent genotype to phenotype configuration at one chosen scale. We assume that each `m` can be written as an effective tuple:

```txt
m = (G_eff(m), R_eff(m), E_eff(m), P_eff(m))
```

where:

* `G_eff(m)` is an effective genomic descriptor, for example modules of genes and regulatory elements.
* `R_eff(m)` is an effective regulatory landscape descriptor, for example network motifs and signaling modules.
* `E_eff(m)` is an effective environment descriptor at developmental scales.
* `P_eff(m)` is an effective phenotypic descriptor at the same scale, including traits, morphologies, and functional profiles.

We assume:

* Each component lives in a finite dimensional parameter space that can be treated as a subset of some Euclidean space.
* Components can include both discrete module indices and continuous parameters, consistent with hybrid semantics.
* For the class of states considered, all four components are well defined and finite.

We do not describe how these effective descriptors are computed from sequences, experiments, or simulations.

### 3.2 Finite libraries and admissible encoding class

To avoid free tuning and to keep encodings auditable, we specify the following finite libraries:

1. A library of genotype modules:

```txt
Lib_G = {g_1, g_2, ..., g_NG}
```

2. A library of phenotypic traits or modules:

```txt
Lib_P = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_NP}
```

3. Libraries of environmental and regulatory modules:

```txt
Lib_E = {e_1, ..., e_NE}
Lib_R = {r_1, ..., r_NR}
```

We also fix a finite or countable index set of resolution levels:

```txt
R_res
```

An admissible developmental encoding is any mapping in the class:

```txt
E_dev_maps = { Gamma_r : (G_eff, R_eff, E_eff) -> P_eff  | r in R_res }
```

with the following constraints:

* For each resolution index `r` in `R_res`, `Gamma_r` uses only modules from `Lib_G`, `Lib_R`, `Lib_E` and outputs traits from `Lib_P`.
* The functional form of `Gamma_r` is fixed before any experiment or dataset is selected.
* `Gamma_r` cannot depend on the specific empirical states `m` on which we later evaluate tension.
* Refinement means moving from a coarser index `r` to a finer one in `R_res`, not arbitrarily changing the library or the functional family.

These libraries and the set `R_res` are part of the parameter set `W` for Q078.

The data maps `D` in `E_dev` send raw genotype, regulatory, environment, and phenotype data into the corresponding effective descriptors and into these libraries. The list `L` specifies which organisms and datasets are declared to be in scope for a given `E*_dev`.

### 3.3 Effective observables

On `M_dev` we define the following observables, always as effective layer maps.

1. Developmental coherence observable

```txt
DevMap_coherence(m; r) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, resolution index `r`.
* Output: a scalar summarizing how predictably `Gamma_r` maps `G_eff(m), R_eff(m), E_eff(m)` to `P_eff(m)`.
* Interpretation: higher values indicate better match between encoded mapping and observed phenotype.

2. Developmental robustness observable

```txt
DevMap_robustness(m; r) >= 0
```

We fix in advance a finite set of standardized perturbations:

```txt
Perturb_set(r) = {delta_1, ..., delta_K(r)}
```

Each `delta_k` describes a small change in `G_eff` or `E_eff` allowed at resolution `r`. These perturbations and their allowed ranges are part of `W`. Then:

* `DevMap_robustness(m; r)` is defined using only `Perturb_set(r)` and measures how stable `P_eff(m)` remains under these perturbations when propagated through `Gamma_r`.

3. Modularity observable

```txt
DevMap_modularity(m; r) >= 0
```

* Summarizes how well phenotype modules in `P_eff(m)` can be explained as combinations of genotype and regulatory modules from `Lib_G` and `Lib_R` under `Gamma_r`.
* Values are constrained to a fixed interval, for example `[0, 1]`, where higher values indicate stronger modular structure.

4. Developmental mismatch observable

We fix a reference class of structured genotype to phenotype maps:

```txt
Ref_dev = { Gamma_r^ref | r in R_res }
```

This reference class is chosen once, using standard developmental models and known examples, and does not depend on later data. It is part of the parameter set `W`. For each `m` and `r` we define:

```txt
DeltaS_dev(m; r) >= 0
```

as a scalar measuring how far the observed mapping encoded in `m` deviates from the reference class predictions at resolution `r`.

We require:

* `DeltaS_dev(m; r) = 0` if the encoded mapping matches a reference mapping within pre specified tolerance at that resolution.
* `DeltaS_dev` is computed using only `Gamma_r`, `Gamma_r^ref`, and the library elements, not by tuning after seeing results.

### 3.4 Tension tensor component and regular subset

We define a developmental tension tensor component at the effective layer:

```txt
T_dev(m; r) = S_dev(m; r) * C_dev(m; r) * DeltaS_dev(m; r) * lambda_dev(m; r) * kappa_dev
```

where:

* `S_dev(m; r)` is a source like factor summarizing how many genotype and regulatory modules are actively engaged.
* `C_dev(m; r)` is a receptivity factor summarizing how sensitive downstream phenotypic modules are to mismatch.
* `DeltaS_dev(m; r)` is the developmental mismatch defined above.
* `lambda_dev(m; r)` indicates the local convergence state of developmental reasoning about this map, constrained to a fixed interval.
* `kappa_dev` is a constant setting the overall scale for this problem.

All of these functions and constants are part of the observable set `F` and parameter set `W` in `E_dev`.

Some states may lead to undefined or non finite observables, for example if `Gamma_r` is not applicable at a chosen resolution. We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing_dev = { m in M_dev :
               for some r, DeltaS_dev(m; r) or DevMap_coherence(m; r)
               is not finite or not defined }
```

We then restrict analysis to the regular subset:

```txt
M_dev_reg = M_dev \ S_sing_dev
```

All later invariants, tension functionals, world descriptions, and experiments are defined and interpreted only on `M_dev_reg`. States that fall in `S_sing_dev` are treated as out of domain for Q078.

### 3.5 Invariants and reference bands

We define two invariants using the resolution index set `R_res`.

1. Multi scale coherence invariant

```txt
I_coh(m) = max over r in R_res of DevMap_coherence(m; r)
```

Since `R_res` is finite or countable and fixed, this is a well defined maximum or supremum over a constrained set.

2. Multi scale mismatch invariant

```txt
I_mismatch(m) = max over r in R_res of DeltaS_dev(m; r)
```

In low tension worlds we expect that for world representing states:

* `I_coh(m)` stays high across `R_res`.
* `I_mismatch(m)` can be kept within a bounded range that does not grow without bound as resolution increases.

To organise tension scales we introduce a finite or countable library of reference tension bands:

```txt
L_ref_dev = { B_1, ..., B_K }
```

Each band is an interval:

```txt
B_j = [T_min_j, T_max_j]
```

with `0 <= T_min_j <= T_max_j`, and all `B_j` are subsets of the non negative real line. These bands are part of the parameter set `W`. When we speak of low tension bands or acceptable tension ranges for Q078, we refer to bands drawn from `L_ref_dev`.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q078 is framed as a tension problem inside TU.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define a developmental tension functional on `M_dev_reg`:

```txt
Tension_dev(m) = F(DevMap_coherence(m; r), DevMap_robustness(m; r),
                   DevMap_modularity(m; r), DeltaS_dev(m; r), r in R_res)
```

For practical use we take a linear example:

```txt
Tension_dev(m) = a_coh * (C_max - I_coh(m))
               + a_rob * R_penalty(m)
               + a_mod * (M_max - avg_r DevMap_modularity(m; r))
               + a_mis * I_mismatch(m)
```

where:

* `a_coh, a_rob, a_mod, a_mis` are fixed positive weights chosen once before experiments.
* `C_max` and `M_max` are fixed upper reference values for coherence and modularity.
* `R_penalty(m)` is a non negative function of `DevMap_robustness(m; r)` values.
* `avg_r` is an average over `R_res` using a fixed weight scheme.

This functional satisfies:

* `Tension_dev(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_dev_reg`.
* If the map is highly coherent, robust, modular, and close to reference, then `Tension_dev(m)` is small.
* If any of these properties fail badly across scales, `Tension_dev(m)` grows.

The functional form and all constants are part of the observable set `F` and parameter set `W` and must be fixed as part of an encoding instance `E*_dev` before applying the scheme to real datasets.

### 4.2 Low tension developmental worlds

At the effective layer, a world is low tension for Q078 if the following holds:

* There exists at least one encoding instance

  ```txt
  E*_dev = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
  ```

  with a chosen band library `L_ref_dev` in `W*` and at least one band

  ```txt
  B_low = [T_min_low, T_max_low] in L_ref_dev
  ```

  such that for world representing states `m_world` in `M_dev_reg` we have:

  ```txt
  Tension_dev(m_world) <= T_max_low
  ```

  for most relevant states and contexts, and such that `T_max_low` does not grow without bound when resolution is increased within `R_res`.

Intuitively:

* Small structured changes in genotype and environment lead to predictable phenotypic changes.
* Modularity and robustness indicators are stable and interpretable across scales.
* A small set of developmental rules compresses most observed genotype to phenotype variation at the chosen scales, and this compression is reflected by low `Tension_dev` values that remain inside reference bands from `L_ref_dev`.

### 4.3 High tension developmental worlds

A world is high tension for Q078 if, for any encoding instance `E*_dev` that respects the libraries and fairness constraints and for any admissible low tension band

```txt
B in L_ref_dev
```

we have:

* For world representing states `m_world` in `M_dev_reg` there exists a positive lower bound `delta_dev` such that:

  ```txt
  Tension_dev(m_world) >= delta_dev > sup B
  ```

  on a non negligible fraction of states, and this lower bound cannot be reduced arbitrarily by refining resolution within `R_res` or by modestly adjusting encoding parameters inside the pre declared ranges of `W*`.

Intuitively:

* Genotype to phenotype relationships remain effectively brittle or opaque across scales.
* Robust modular developmental rules do not emerge under any fair encoding in `E_dev`.
* The map cannot be compressed without losing essential structure or predictive power, which shows up as persistently high `Tension_dev` outside any admissible low tension band in `L_ref_dev`.

Q078 then asks whether the biological universe we observe looks more like a low tension or high tension developmental world under this effective description.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds, both strictly at the effective layer and only in terms of observables and tension patterns.

### 5.1 World T: structured genotype to phenotype map

World T assumptions:

1. Existence of a good encoding

There exists an encoding instance `E*_dev` and a choice of low tension band `B_low` in `L_ref_dev` such that for world representing states `m_T`:

```txt
Tension_dev(m_T) is small and stable across r in R_res
and lies mostly inside B_low
```

2. Predictable perturbations

For standardized perturbations in `Perturb_set(r)`:

* Changes in `G_eff` and `E_eff` propagate to `P_eff` through `Gamma_r` in a way that can be compressed into a small set of rules, reflected in high `DevMap_coherence(m_T; r)` and acceptable `DevMap_robustness(m_T; r)`.

3. Stable modularity

`DevMap_modularity(m_T; r)` remains in a high band across `R_res`:

* genotype modules in `Lib_G` and regulatory modules in `Lib_R` map to phenotypic modules in `Lib_P` in a relatively stable way across related organisms and environments.

4. Cross species compression

The same encoding can be reused to explain variation across related species with only moderate increases in `DeltaS_dev`, providing a cross species low tension map that keeps `Tension_dev` inside bands drawn from `L_ref_dev`.

### 5.2 World F: essentially unstructured map

World F assumptions:

1. No low tension encoding

For any encoding instance `E*_dev` and any low tension band `B` in `L_ref_dev`:

* there exists a positive lower bound `delta_dev` such that `Tension_dev(m_F) >= delta_dev > sup B` for world representing states `m_F`, regardless of which resolution indices are used.

2. Fragile or chaotic perturbations

Standardized perturbations lead to:

* large, irregular, or context specific changes in `P_eff(m_F)`,
* low `DevMap_coherence(m_F; r)` and problematic `DevMap_robustness(m_F; r)` across scales.

3. Broken modularity

`DevMap_modularity(m_F; r)` oscillates or remains low:

* phenotypic modules cannot be consistently connected to genotype and regulatory modules,
* attempts to construct modular accounts yield high `DeltaS_dev` even with generous tolerance.

4. Poor cross species compression

No single encoding in `E_dev_maps` can compress genotype to phenotype variation across related species without `DeltaS_dev` blowing up or `Tension_dev` moving into clearly high tension bands beyond any `B` in `L_ref_dev`.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These descriptions do not claim that TU constructs or simulates full developmental dynamics. They only state how observables and tension patterns would differ if the biological universe behaved like World T or World F at the effective layer.

They also do not fix any bottom layer TU model. They only constrain which effective encodings and band choices in `L_ref_dev` would be compatible with observed genotype to phenotype data.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments that can test and potentially falsify specific Q078 encodings. They do not solve the biological problem, but they can rule out or support particular tension encodings.

All experiments are understood to operate on states in `M_dev_reg`. Any state that falls into `S_sing_dev` is treated as out of domain and is excluded from tension based conclusions.

### Experiment 1: Multi scale perturbation and prediction

**Goal**
Test whether a fixed admissible encoding instance and tension functional can predict phenotypic outcomes of standardized genotype and environment perturbations better than baselines.

**Setup**

* Choose a model organism with mapped developmental genetics and accessible perturbation tools.
* Fix an encoding instance

  ```txt
  E*_dev = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
  ```

  including:

  * a concrete family `Gamma_r` in `E_dev_maps`,
  * a set `R_res`,
  * the band library `L_ref_dev` and a candidate low tension band `B_low`,
  * all parameters in `Tension_dev`, including `a_*`, `C_max`, `M_max`.
* Predefine `Perturb_set(r)` for each `r` based on realistic experimental manipulations. These sets are part of `W*`.

**Protocol**

1. For each perturbation in `Perturb_set(r)` at each chosen resolution, construct a state `m_data` in `M_dev_reg` that encodes `G_eff`, `R_eff`, `E_eff` before and after perturbation, plus observed `P_eff`.
2. Use `Gamma_r` to produce predicted `P_eff` summaries from the pre perturbation side.
3. Compute for each case:

   * prediction error statistics between predicted and observed `P_eff`,
   * `DevMap_coherence(m_data; r)`,
   * `DevMap_robustness(m_data; r)`,
   * `DeltaS_dev(m_data; r)` and `Tension_dev(m_data)`.
4. Aggregate results over all perturbations and resolutions.

**Metrics**

* Fraction of perturbations where prediction error is below a fixed threshold.
* Distribution of `DevMap_coherence` and `DevMap_robustness` values.
* Distribution of `Tension_dev` values across the experiment set and relative to the chosen low tension band `B_low`.

**Falsification conditions**

Let:

* `theta_err` be an acceptable prediction error bound.
* `phi_ok` be a minimum acceptable fraction of perturbations that should be predicted within `theta_err`.
* `T_max` be a maximum acceptable median tension value for an encoding to be considered low tension in this setting.

All three quantities `theta_err`, `phi_ok`, and `T_max` are elements of the parameter set `W*` and must be fixed before seeing the evaluation data.

For the fixed encoding instance `E*_dev`:

* If the fraction of perturbations with error below `theta_err` falls below `phi_ok`, and at the same time the median `Tension_dev` across the experiment set exceeds `T_max` and lies outside the chosen band `B_low` in `L_ref_dev`, then `E*_dev` is rejected for Q078 in this data regime.
* If small adjustments of `Gamma_r` within `E_dev_maps` that stay inside the predefined functional family and parameter ranges in `W*` lead to arbitrarily different tension profiles while keeping libraries fixed, the encoding instance is deemed unstable and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
All quantities are implemented using hybrid representations of discrete genotype like variables and continuous phenotype and environment variables, in accordance with the metadata summary.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding instance `E*_dev` does not solve the canonical scientific statement. This experiment can reject specific effective encodings and parameter choices, but it does not prove or disprove any deep biological theory of genotype to phenotype mappings.

---

### Experiment 2: Cross species compression test

**Goal**
Assess whether a single admissible encoding instance can compress genotype to phenotype relationships across a set of related species.

**Setup**

* Select several related species with genomic, developmental, and phenotypic datasets.
* Fix a single encoding instance

  ```txt
  E*_dev = (D*, F*, W*, L*)
  ```

  including:

  * a family `Gamma_r` in `E_dev_maps`,
  * `R_res`,
  * parameter values for `Tension_dev`,
  * a band library `L_ref_dev` and candidate low tension bands for the species set.
* Choose a common set of modules from `Lib_G`, `Lib_R`, `Lib_E`, `Lib_P` that applies to all chosen species. These choices are part of `W*`.

**Protocol**

1. For each species and resolution index `r`, construct states `m_species` in `M_dev_reg` representing typical genotype, regulatory, and environmental conditions and observed phenotypes.
2. Use `Gamma_r` to fit or approximate the mapping from genotype and environment modules to phenotypic modules, subject to the fixed libraries.
3. Compute for each species:

   * a compression ratio `C_ratio` comparing the description length of the mapping to the description length of a naive lookup table over observed conditions,
   * `DeltaS_dev(m_species; r)` and `Tension_dev(m_species)`.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `C_ratio` across species.
* Distribution of `Tension_dev` values across species and resolutions and their relation to bands in `L_ref_dev`.
* Relation between compression ratio and tension: whether better compression systematically corresponds to lower tension.

**Falsification conditions**

Let:

* `C_min` be a minimum acceptable compression ratio indicating a successful structured encoding.
* `T_band` be a band of tension values considered low for this context, drawn from `L_ref_dev`.

Both `C_min` and `T_band` are elements of `W*` and must be fixed before cross species evaluation.

For the fixed encoding instance `E*_dev`:

* If no encoding in `E_dev_maps` that respects the fixed libraries and parameter ranges in `W*` achieves `C_ratio >= C_min` for more than a small fraction of species while also keeping `Tension_dev` mostly within `T_band`, this style of encoding is rejected for Q078 at the effective layer.
* If encodings that perform well in one species systematically fail in closely related species, with `Tension_dev` jumping into clearly high tension bands beyond any reasonable `T_band` in `L_ref_dev`, the claim that the map is cross species low tension is rejected for that encoding instance.

**Semantics implementation note**
All species specific variables are represented using the same hybrid effective representation scheme as in Experiment 1, so differences in results are not artifacts of inconsistent encodings.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding instance in this test does not solve the canonical biological statement. Success or failure only informs whether a particular effective encoding class is adequate for cross species genotype to phenotype maps.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block specifies how Q078 is used as an engineering module for AI systems under WFGY, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define four training signals. All constants used below, including `C_max`, `M_max`, and weight factors, are taken from the parameter set `W*` of an encoding instance and are fixed before training.

1. `signal_dev_coherence`

   * Definition: a positive penalty proportional to `(C_max - DevMap_coherence(m; r))` aggregated over relevant `r`.
   * Purpose: encourage internal states in which genotype and environment descriptions imply phenotypes coherently under the chosen encoding.

2. `signal_dev_robustness`

   * Definition: a positive penalty when small changes in effective genotype or environment representations lead to large changes in predicted phenotypic representations.
   * Purpose: steer models toward encodings where phenotype predictions are robust under standardized perturbations drawn from `Perturb_set(r)`.

3. `signal_dev_modularity`

   * Definition: a reward term proportional to `DevMap_modularity(m; r)`, favoring explanations built from stable modules.
   * Purpose: promote modular internal structure that can be transferred across tasks and species.

4. `signal_dev_tension`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `Tension_dev(m)`.
   * Purpose: summary signal for how well the model maintains a structured genotype to phenotype map in contexts where such structure is assumed.

All signals are computed from internal representations mapped into the effective layer variables, without exposing any TU bottom layer construction rules.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We specify three architectural patterns.

1. `DevMapHead`

   * Role: auxiliary head that outputs effective summaries of genotype, environment, and phenotype along with tension estimates.
   * Interface:

     * Input: internal embeddings from a base model given genomic and environmental context.
     * Outputs:

       * estimated `G_eff`, `E_eff`, and `P_eff`,
       * `DevMap_coherence`, `DevMap_robustness`, `DevMap_modularity`,
       * `Tension_dev`.

2. `GenotypePhenoConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: filter module that evaluates candidate explanations or predictions about genotype to phenotype links.
   * Interface:

     * Input: internal or textual representation of a proposed genotype to phenotype relationship.
     * Output: a score or mask indicating whether the relationship implies high or low tension under the current encoding.

3. `DevMapTransferBridge`

   * Role: bridge module for transferring insight from one species or dataset to another by reusing `E_dev_maps` and associated observables.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: source and target context representations.
     * Output: suggested shared modules and an estimate of transfer tension, used to decide how aggressively to transfer patterns.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline an evaluation harness for models augmented with Q078 style modules.

1. Task families

   * Phenotype prediction from genetic and environmental inputs.
   * Explanation of known genotype to phenotype associations.
   * Generalization of developmental rules across related species.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline: model without Q078 modules or signals.
   * TU augmented: same base model with DevMapHead, filters, and Q078 signals active during training or fine tuning.

3. Metrics

   * Predictive accuracy on held out perturbations and species.
   * Stability of predictions under small input perturbations.
   * Consistency of explanations across related contexts.
   * Reduction in `Tension_dev` for world like inputs when Q078 modules are active.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

To let external users experience Q078 directly:

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask the model to describe how genetic changes and environmental conditions shape phenotypes in a chosen model organism.
  * Observation: record whether explanations are fragmented, overconfident, or inconsistent about robustness and modularity.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Prompt: same biological question, but with an instruction that the explanation should be organized around:

    * robust mappings from genotype modules to phenotype modules,
    * explicit discussion of modularity and robustness across perturbations,
    * an implicit low tension developmental map.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation highlights modules, perturbations, and robustness in a more structured way.

* Comparison metric:

  * Use a rubric that scores:

    * clarity of mapping from genotype and environment to phenotype,
    * explicit handling of robustness and modularity,
    * internal consistency across multiple paragraphs.

* What to log:

  * Prompts, raw outputs, and any DevMapHead tension values.
  * These logs allow external audit without revealing TU bottom layer details.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the main reusable components from Q078 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `DevMap_field`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: effective descriptors `G_eff`, `R_eff`, `E_eff` built from the agreed libraries.
     * Output: `P_eff` summary and local `DeltaS_dev` at chosen resolutions.
   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must be encoded using `Lib_G`, `Lib_R`, `Lib_E`.
     * The chosen encoding `Gamma_r` must belong to `E_dev_maps`.

2. ComponentName: `DevMap_tension_functional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Input: state `m` in `M_dev_reg`.
     * Output: scalar `Tension_dev(m)` and, optionally, a small vector of contributions, including coherence, robustness, modularity, and mismatch terms.
   * Preconditions:

     * All necessary observables for `m` are finite.
     * Resolution set `R_res` and parameter values are fixed and known as part of `W*`.

3. ComponentName: `DevMap_modularity_profile`

   * Type: observable

     * Input: state `m`, resolution index `r`.
     * Output: a non negative scalar summarizing modularity plus optional discrete tags for module groupings.
   * Preconditions:

     * `Lib_G`, `Lib_R`, `Lib_P` have been instantiated and mapped into the problem at hand.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q075 `BH_BIO_AGING_L3_075`

   * Reused components: `DevMap_field`, `DevMap_tension_functional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Aging can be viewed as gradual changes in `R_eff` and `E_eff` that deform the same underlying genotype to phenotype map.
   * What changes:

     * State space extended to include time and damage variables.
     * Additional observables track how `Tension_dev` shifts along individual lifespan trajectories.

2. Q077 `BH_BIO_MICROBIOME_L3_077`

   * Reused components: `DevMap_tension_functional`, `DevMap_modularity_profile`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Host genotype, environment, and microbiome composition jointly shape host phenotype. This can be treated as an extended mapping with similar consistency_tension.
   * What changes:

     * `E_eff` extended to include microbiome descriptors.
     * New modules in `Lib_E` and `Lib_P` representing host microbe interactions.

3. Q123 `BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123`

   * Reused components: `DevMap_field`, `DevMap_modularity_profile`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Interpreting neural networks can reuse genotype to phenotype style mappings, with network parameters as genotype and internal features as phenotype like objects.
   * What changes:

     * `G_eff` becomes an effective descriptor of network weights or architecture.
     * `P_eff` becomes a descriptor of internal feature maps and output behavior.
     * Libraries are redefined for AI contexts, but the consistency_tension structure is preserved.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block situates Q078 in the TU verification ladder and sets concrete next steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * An effective encoding has been specified:

    * state space `M_dev` and its regular subset `M_dev_reg`,
    * finite libraries and admissible encoding class `E_dev_maps`,
    * observables and tension functional `Tension_dev`,
    * singular set `S_sing_dev` and domain restrictions,
    * band library `L_ref_dev`.
  * Discriminating experiment families are defined with falsification conditions that reference specific encoding instances `E*_dev`.

* N_level: N2

  * A coherent narrative links genotype, regulatory systems, environment, and phenotype through consistency_tension.
  * Counterfactual worlds T and F are described using observable patterns and tension bands.
  * Q078 is connected to upstream origin and downstream biosphere questions.

### 9.2 Next measurable steps toward higher levels

To move toward E2 and N3, the following steps are proposed:

1. Implement a prototype tool that:

   * takes simplified genotype, environment, and phenotype data for a model organism,
   * instantiates an encoding instance `E*_dev` with documented `E_dev_maps`, `M_dev`, and `Tension_dev`,
   * outputs tension profiles for perturbation and cross species like experiments.

2. Publish at least one open benchmark dataset with:

   * standardized `Perturb_set(r)` for an organism,
   * corresponding effective `M_dev` states,
   * example computations of `DevMap_coherence`, `DevMap_robustness`, and `Tension_dev`.

3. Develop at least one AI model that uses Q078 style signals and modules, and compare its behavior against baselines on developmental genetics style tasks.

Each step must remain within the effective layer and avoid exposing TU bottom layer construction rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

Long term, Q078 is expected to serve as:

* The central biological node for consistency_tension between information bearing substrates and multicellular phenotypes.
* A template for mapping from code spaces to emergent configurations in other domains, including neural coding and AI interpretability.
* A test bed for whether TU encodings can handle systems where the map is high dimensional, context dependent, and historically contingent, without defaulting to trivial or unfalsifiable descriptions.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block is for non specialists, while staying aligned with the effective layer description.

In ordinary language:

* The genotype is like a set of instructions written in the genome.
* The phenotype is what the organism actually becomes and does: its body plan, organs, behaviors, and so on.
* Between these two sits development, which reads and interprets the instructions in specific environments.

The hard question is:

* Is there a reasonably simple, reusable set of rules that explains how changes in the instructions and in the environment lead to changes in the phenotype. Or is the relationship basically so complicated and context dependent that every case is special.

In the Tension Universe view for Q078:

* We do not try to simulate every molecule.
* Instead we imagine a space of effective states. Each state summarizes:

  * which genetic and regulatory modules are present,
  * which environmental conditions matter,
  * which phenotypic traits show up.

For each such state we measure:

* how well a fixed set of developmental rules predicts the observed traits,
* how robust those traits are when we make small changes in genes or environment,
* how modular the system looks, meaning whether it is built from reusable building blocks.

We combine these measurements into a single number called `Tension_dev`.

Roughly:

* If development is structured and understandable, `Tension_dev` can be kept small across different situations and species and inside reference bands from `L_ref_dev`.
* If development is opaque and brittle under every fair way of describing it, `Tension_dev` stays large and refuses to fit into any such band.

This framework does not tell us the detailed rules of development. It also does not say what evolution will do in the future. What it does give is:

* a way to talk about the genotype to phenotype map as a structured object,
* a way to design experiments that test whether a proposed description is reasonable or not,
* reusable tools that can be applied to other mappings from low level codes to high level behavior, in brains or in artificial systems.

Q078 is therefore the main biological test case for these ideas inside the Tension Universe. If we cannot find a low tension encoding here, that is important. If we can, that becomes a powerful template for many other problems.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of Q078 in the Tension Universe framework.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical scientific statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open scientific problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here, including state spaces `M_dev`, observables, invariants, tension scores, and counterfactual worlds, live at the effective layer.
* No TU bottom layer axiom system, generative rule, or constructive mechanism is specified or assumed to be unique.
* No mapping is provided from raw experimental data to any hypothetical bottom layer TU fields.
* All encodings are understood as testable summaries over observable configurations only.

### Encodings and fairness

* The encoding class `E_dev = (D, F, W, L)` and its instances `E*_dev` are defined with finite libraries, fixed parameter bands, and explicit domain restrictions.
* For any concrete experiment or benchmark, the choice of `E*_dev`, including thresholds and tension bands from `L_ref_dev`, must be fixed before inspecting evaluation data.
* Parameter changes after seeing outcomes are outside the allowed fairness rules and invalidate any low tension claim for that encoding instance.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
