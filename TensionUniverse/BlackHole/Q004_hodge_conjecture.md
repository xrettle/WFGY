## 0.1 Semantics and projection

* Projection dominance `I` means Q004 is encoded primarily at the information and structural level rather than at raw metric or physical scales.
* Field type `analytic_field` means the effective objects are analytic or cohomological fields whose summaries are treated as continuous data, combined with discrete invariants.
* Semantics `hybrid` means that:

  * cohomology groups, Hodge decompositions, and dimensions are treated as continuous or algebraic data,
  * algebraic cycles, test class labels, and profile selections are treated as discrete or combinatorial data.

All reasoning in this file is restricted to this hybrid effective interpretation.

## 0.2 Q004 effective layer constitution

Q004 inherits and specializes the common Tension Universe effective layer constitution, as constrained by:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

For this problem, we lock the following principles.

1. **Effective layer only**

   * This file does not define or expose any deep TU axioms, generators, or constructive rules.
   * There is no mapping here from raw experimental or symbolic data into internal TU fields.
   * All objects (state spaces, observables, invariants, tensions, worlds) live at the effective layer and are described only by their interfaces and observable behavior.

2. **Admissible encoding classes and finite libraries**

   * Every Q004 encoding belongs to an admissible encoding class `Enc_HC`, defined using finite libraries:

     * `Lib_variety_profiles`
     * `Lib_dimension_sources_Hodge`
     * `Lib_dimension_sources_cycle`
     * `Lib_weight_pairs`
     * `Lib_indicator_modes`
     * `Lib_aggregation_schemes`
   * Any concrete encoding is specified by picking one element from each library and a refinement schedule, and freezing those choices before evaluation.

3. **Countable refinement and determinism**

   * Refinement is indexed by a discrete parameter `r` in a countable set, with `r` increasing meaning strictly more detailed summaries.
   * Any supremum, infimum, or aggregation across `(X, k)` or refinement levels is taken over:

     * a finite set, or
     * an explicitly defined countable set, constructed by a deterministic rule declared in the spec.
   * No construction in this file depends on uncountable choices or on ad hoc, data dependent region selection.

4. **Singular sets and out of domain**

   * States for which required observables are undefined, numerically unstable, or undecidable under the declared tolerance model are collected into an explicit singular set `S_sing_HC`.
   * All tension statements in this file are restricted to the regular domain `M_reg_HC`, defined as `M_HC \ S_sing_HC`.
   * Evaluations attempted on `S_sing_HC` are recorded as “out of domain” and are not interpreted as evidence about the Hodge Conjecture.

5. **Tension scale and dimensionless normalization**

   * All mismatch quantities `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals for Q004 are defined as dimensionless numbers in `[0, 1]` or in a bounded interval.
   * Raw quantities such as dimension differences are normalized by explicit denominators so that:

     * there is no hidden dependence on arbitrary unit choices,
     * thresholds can be interpreted relative to a common Tension Universe scale as specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
   * Any rescaling of the tension scale must be implemented via an explicit charter update, not by editing this file.

6. **Fairness and anti cheat**

   * Choices of:

     * variety profiles,
     * dimension sources,
     * indicator modes and thresholds,
     * weight pairs,
     * aggregation schemes,
     * refinement schedules,
       are frozen and published before running experiments or evaluations on a given dataset.
   * These choices may depend on general mathematical considerations and public benchmark selections, but never on the unknown truth value of HC or on detailed results for the same batch of data.

7. **Falsifiability boundary**

   * Experiments in Block 6 test Q004 encodings and pipelines, not the truth of the Hodge Conjecture.
   * “Encoding falsified” and “conjecture solved” are strictly different claims and must not be conflated.

8. **Non mutation and versioning**

   * Within this file version, definitions of state spaces, observables, mismatch quantities, and tension functionals are frozen.
   * Any substantial change requires a new versioned file or an explicit changelog entry, and must not silently alter prior definitions.

The footer at the end of this file restates these rules in a problem independent, charter aligned form.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Let `X` be a smooth projective complex algebraic variety and let `H^{2k}(X, Q)` be its degree `2k` rational cohomology.

The Hodge decomposition gives a splitting of `H^{2k}(X, C)` into pieces `H^{p,q}(X)` with `p + q = 2k` and complex conjugation exchanging `H^{p,q}` and `H^{q,p}`. A class in `H^{2k}(X, Q)` is called a Hodge class of degree `2k` if its image in `H^{2k}(X, C)` lies in `H^{k,k}(X)` after tensoring with `C`.

There is also a subspace of `H^{2k}(X, Q)` generated by the cohomology classes of algebraic cycles of codimension `k` on `X`. These are classes represented by finite rational linear combinations of closed subvarieties of codimension `k`.

The Hodge Conjecture (HC) asserts:

> Every Hodge class in `H^{2k}(X, Q)` is a rational linear combination of cohomology classes of algebraic cycles of codimension `k`.

Equivalently, for each `k`, the `Q` vector space of Hodge classes in `H^{2k}(X, Q)` should be equal to the `Q` vector space spanned by the classes of codimension `k` algebraic cycles.

This is required to hold for all smooth projective complex varieties `X` and for all integers `k`.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The Hodge Conjecture is one of the central open problems in modern algebraic geometry and is listed as a Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problem. It is known in some special cases, for example:

* For divisors (`k = 1`), the conjecture reduces to the Lefschetz `(1,1)` theorem, which is known to be true.
* For certain classes of varieties, such as complex abelian varieties of low dimension, various partial results are known.
* In general, however, the question of whether every Hodge class is algebraic remains wide open.

The conjecture is deeply connected to:

* the theory of pure Hodge structures,
* the study of algebraic cycles and the Chow groups of varieties,
* the theory of motives and standard conjectures in algebraic geometry.

No proof or disproof is known in full generality. The conjecture is widely believed to be very difficult and is expected to require new tools beyond current techniques.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q004 plays several roles:

1. It is the canonical example of a **consistency_tension** problem between two descriptions of the same cohomological structure:

   * analytic Hodge decomposition into `H^{p,q}` pieces,
   * algebraic cycle classes in cohomology.
2. It extends the pattern of Q003 (BSD) from curves and elliptic curves to higher dimensional varieties, where cohomology is richer and cycles are more complicated.
3. It provides a geometric and cohomological counterpart to Q001 (Riemann Hypothesis), since both express the idea that:

   * a certain analytic structure and a certain arithmetic or geometric structure should match,
   * failure of this match would show up as a persistent tension between two subspaces or two types of data.
4. It supplies a template for tension encodings on:

   * hybrid spaces that combine continuous data (harmonic forms, metrics) and discrete data (integral classes, intersection numbers),
   * problems where “being algebraic” is a structural property rather than a simple formula.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q004 sits in the BlackHole graph of Q001–Q125. Each edge lists a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or frameworks that Q004 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016)
  Reason: Provides foundational perspective on sets, real and complex numbers, and cohomology theories used to define the analytic_field and consistency_tension encodings.

* Q013 (BH_MATH_LANG_L3_013)
  Reason: Supplies the general framework of motives where Hodge structures, algebraic cycles, and Galois or automorphic data are different realizations of a common object.

* Q003 (BH_MATH_BSD_L3_003)
  Reason: Encodes a prototype link between cohomological invariants and arithmetic invariants for elliptic curves that Q004 generalizes to higher dimensions.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q004 components or depend on its tension structure.

* Q005 (BH_MATH_ABC_L3_005)
  Reason: Uses high level structure of curves and their Jacobians where Hodge type constraints influence possible Diophantine patterns at the effective layer.

* Q013 (BH_MATH_LANG_L3_013)
  Reason: Reuses Hodge consistency functionals to check whether geometric realizations of motives behave as expected under automorphic and Galois correspondences.

* Q018 (BH_MATH_RANDOM_MATRIX_ZEROS_L3_018)
  Reason: Uses cohomology field descriptors and tension functional patterns to relate spectral statistics of L functions to geometry where Hodge data appear.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001, Riemann Hypothesis)
  Reason: Both Q001 and Q004 express consistency_tension between analytic information (zeta or Hodge decomposition) and arithmetic or geometric structures.

* Q003 (BH_MATH_BSD_L3_003)
  Reason: Shares the pattern “cohomology invariants coincide with algebraic or arithmetic invariants”, though in Q003 this is for elliptic curves.

* Q006 (BH_MATH_GOLDBACH_L3_006)
  Reason: Is a parallel archetypal number theoretic S problem whose deep structure is conjecturally linked to geometric and Hodge theoretic patterns via motives.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q004 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Uses geometric and topological invariants of configuration spaces where decompositions analogous to Hodge decomposition encode consistency between local differential data and global phases.

* Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039)
  Reason: Imports the idea of decomposing complex state spaces into structured subspaces and measuring consistency_tension between “geometric” and “observable” components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses the pattern of splitting information spaces into “cycle generated” versus “ambient” parts and measuring the tension between them.

All edges reference Q identifiers only and can be assembled into an adjacency list for the full BlackHole graph.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* mismatch quantities and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or how internal TU fields are constructed from raw data.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a state space

```txt
M_HC
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer.

Each state `m` in `M_HC` describes a “Hodge configuration” for a finite collection of pairs `(X, k)`, where:

* `X` is a smooth projective complex variety from an admissible profile library,
* `k` is a nonnegative integer degree index.

The state carries finite summaries of:

* the rational cohomology groups `H^{2k}(X, Q)` seen through:

  * Hodge numbers,
  * basic intersection data needed to distinguish candidates,
* the Hodge decomposition structure on `H^{2k}(X, C)`,
* the subspace of `H^{2k}(X, Q)` generated by algebraic cycles of codimension `k`,
* a finite library of test cohomology class summaries for each `(X, k)`,
* metadata that records:

  * which variety profile in `Lib_variety_profiles` is used for each `(X, k)`,
  * which dimension source is used for Hodge data and for cycle data,
  * which indicator mode and threshold are used,
  * which weight pair and aggregation scheme are active,
  * the refinement level `r`.

We do not specify how such states are constructed from raw geometric or cohomological data. We only assume:

* for each admissible `(X, k)` there exist states `m` that encode the required finite summaries,
* these summaries are coherent and finite on a regular subset of `M_HC`,
* refinement is indexed by a discrete parameter `r` in a countable set, where larger `r` corresponds to more detailed and more accurate summaries for the same `(X, k)`.

### 3.2 Dimension sources and class test libraries

We define finite libraries that control how dimensions and test classes enter the encoding.

1. **Hodge dimension sources**

   ```txt
   Lib_dimension_sources_Hodge =
     { HodgeDim_literature, HodgeDim_symbolic, HodgeDim_numeric }
   ```

   Each element describes a reproducible source of Hodge dimension data, for example:

   * literature values from standard references,
   * symbolic computations in a fixed computer algebra system,
   * certified numeric approximations with error bounds.

2. **Algebraic cycle span dimension sources**

   ```txt
   Lib_dimension_sources_cycle =
     { CycleDim_literature, CycleDim_symbolic, CycleDim_enumerative }
   ```

   Each element describes how algebraic cycle span dimensions are obtained, for example:

   * from published classifications,
   * from symbolic manipulation of known cycle generators,
   * from enumerative algorithms with correctness guarantees.

For each state `m` and each `(X, k)` encoded in `m`, the metadata includes:

```txt
HodgeDim_source(m; X, k) in Lib_dimension_sources_Hodge
CycleDim_source(m; X, k) in Lib_dimension_sources_cycle
```

3. **Class test libraries**

For each admissible `(X, k)` there is a finite, deterministically constructed set

```txt
Lib_class_tests(X, k) = { v_1, v_2, ..., v_R }
```

where:

* each `v_j` is a label for a test cohomology class or a test pattern,
* the construction rule for `Lib_class_tests(X, k)` is fixed globally at the charter level, for example:

  * sort candidate classes by a canonical index,
  * apply a fixed pseudorandom hash to select the first `R` that satisfy basic consistency checks,
* the selection does not depend on the unknown truth of HC and does not depend on detailed tension results for this `(X, k)`.

The deterministic construction rule is part of the Q004 encoding and is shared across all states that include `(X, k)`.

### 3.3 Effective fields and observables

On `M_HC` we define the following effective observables.

1. **Hodge subspace dimension**

```txt
Hodge_space_dim(m; X, k) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, variety label `X`, degree index `k`.
* Output: a nonnegative integer giving the dimension of the encoded Hodge `(k, k)` subspace inside `H^{2k}(X, Q) tensor C` as represented in `m`, obtained from `HodgeDim_source(m; X, k)`.

2. **Algebraic cycle span dimension**

```txt
Alg_cycle_span_dim(m; X, k) >= 0
```

* Input: state `m`, variety label `X`, degree index `k`.
* Output: a nonnegative integer giving the dimension of the subspace of `H^{2k}(X, Q)` generated by encoded algebraic cycle classes of codimension `k`, obtained from `CycleDim_source(m; X, k)`.

3. **Hodge like class score and indicator**

For each test class label `v` in `Lib_class_tests(X, k)` we define a soft score:

```txt
Hodge_class_score(m; X, k, v) in [0, 1]
```

interpreted as the degree to which `v` behaves as a Hodge `(k, k)` class in the encoded Hodge structure, according to the chosen dimension and tolerance model.

We also fix a global Hodge threshold `tau_HC_Hodge` with:

```txt
0 < tau_HC_Hodge < 1
```

and define a ternary indicator:

```txt
Hodge_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) in {0, 1, unknown}
```

by:

* `1` if `Hodge_class_score(m; X, k, v) >= tau_HC_Hodge` and the evaluation is numerically and logically stable,
* `0` if `Hodge_class_score(m; X, k, v) < tau_HC_Hodge` and the evaluation is stable,
* `unknown` if the evaluation is unstable or inconclusive under the declared tolerance model.

4. **Algebraic like class score and indicator**

Similarly, we define:

```txt
Alg_class_score(m; X, k, v) in [0, 1]
Alg_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) in {0, 1, unknown}
```

where:

* `Alg_class_score` measures the degree to which `v` lies in the encoded span of algebraic cycle classes of codimension `k`,
* `Alg_class_indicator` applies a global threshold `tau_HC_alg` in `(0, 1)` and the same stability rules to assign `0`, `1`, or `unknown`.

The pair of thresholds `(tau_HC_Hodge, tau_HC_alg)` is part of the indicator mode, defined next.

### 3.4 Indicator modes

We define a finite library of indicator modes:

```txt
Lib_indicator_modes =
  {
    Hard01_with_unknown,
    Soft_scores_plus_thresholds
  }
```

with the following semantics.

* `Hard01_with_unknown`
  The indicators `Hodge_class_indicator` and `Alg_class_indicator` are treated as primary objects:

  * scores are derived only as supporting information,
  * `unknown` entries are pushed into the singular set definition,
  * only classes with indicators in `{0, 1}` are used in mismatch calculations.

* `Soft_scores_plus_thresholds`
  Both scores and indicators are used:

  * the primary mismatch is computed from scores,
  * indicators still carry ternary information for logging and diagnostics,
  * tolerance models rely explicitly on score distributions.

For each state `m`, the metadata contains:

```txt
Indicator_mode(m) in Lib_indicator_modes
```

and the semantics of mismatch quantities refer to that choice.

### 3.5 Hodge mismatch quantities (dimensionless)

We define dimensionless mismatch quantities that lie in `[0, 1]`.

1. **Normalized subspace mismatch at `(X, k)`**

We first define the raw dimension gap:

```txt
Gap_dim(m; X, k) =
  max( Hodge_space_dim(m; X, k) - Alg_cycle_span_dim(m; X, k), 0 )
```

We then normalize by the size of the Hodge subspace:

```txt
DeltaS_space(m; X, k) =
  Gap_dim(m; X, k) / max( Hodge_space_dim(m; X, k), 1 )
```

This yields:

```txt
DeltaS_space(m; X, k) in [0, 1]
```

and removes any dependence on the absolute units of dimension.

2. **Class level mismatch at `(X, k)`**

Let:

```txt
Lib_eff(X, k, m) =
  { v in Lib_class_tests(X, k) :
    Hodge_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) in {0, 1} and
    Alg_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) in {0, 1}
  }
```

That is, we discard all `v` for which at least one indicator is `unknown`. If `Lib_eff(X, k, m)` is empty, the state is treated as singular for this `(X, k)` as described in 3.7.

Define:

```txt
Num_Hodge(m; X, k) =
  number of v in Lib_eff(X, k, m)
  with Hodge_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) = 1

Num_mismatch(m; X, k) =
  number of v in Lib_eff(X, k, m)
  with Hodge_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) = 1
   and Alg_class_indicator(m; X, k, v) = 0
```

Then define:

```txt
DeltaS_class(m; X, k) =
  Num_mismatch(m; X, k)
  / max( Num_Hodge(m; X, k), 1 )
```

which lies in `[0, 1]` and measures the fraction of encoded Hodge like classes in the effective test set that fail to appear as algebraic like classes.

This construction:

* respects the indicator mode and tolerance model,
* pushes unstable or undecidable cases into the singular set instead of forcing misclassification.

### 3.6 Combined Hodge tension functional

We define a finite library of weight pairs:

```txt
Lib_weight_pairs =
  { (alpha_1, beta_1), ..., (alpha_L, beta_L) }
```

such that for each `j`:

```txt
alpha_j > 0, beta_j > 0, alpha_j + beta_j = 1
```

For each state `m`, one pair `(alpha, beta)` is chosen from `Lib_weight_pairs` and recorded in the metadata.

For each admissible `(X, k)` and state `m` in the regular domain (see 3.7), the local Hodge tension is:

```txt
Tension_HC(m; X, k) =
  alpha * DeltaS_space(m; X, k) +
  beta  * DeltaS_class(m; X, k)
```

which satisfies:

```txt
Tension_HC(m; X, k) in [0, 1]
```

and is interpreted relative to the global Tension Universe scale defined by the TU Tension Scale Charter.

For a state `m` that covers several `(X, k)` pairs we define a profile aware aggregate:

```txt
Tension_HC_total(m) =
  Agg_scheme(m)(
    { Tension_HC(m; X, k) for all admissible (X, k) in m }
  )
```

where `Agg_scheme(m)` is selected from a finite library of aggregation schemes.

### 3.7 Aggregation schemes and profile weighting

We define a finite library of aggregation schemes:

```txt
Lib_aggregation_schemes =
  {
    Flat_mean,
    Profile_stratified_mean
  }
```

with the following semantics.

1. **Flat_mean**

   ```txt
   Tension_HC_total(m) =
     average over all admissible (X, k) in m of Tension_HC(m; X, k)
   ```

   All pairs `(X, k)` encoded in the state are weighted equally.

2. **Profile_stratified_mean**

   * First group `(X, k)` pairs in `m` by their variety profile in `Lib_variety_profiles`.

   * For each profile `P` with nonempty group `G_P(m)` define:

     ```txt
     Tension_profile(m; P) =
       average over (X, k) in G_P(m) of Tension_HC(m; X, k)
     ```

   * Then define:

     ```txt
     Tension_HC_total(m) =
       average over profiles P with G_P(m) nonempty of Tension_profile(m; P)
     ```

This stratified averaging prevents easy profiles from overwhelming difficult ones and also prevents a small set of extremely hard objects from dominating the aggregate.

For each state `m`, the metadata records:

```txt
Agg_scheme(m) in Lib_aggregation_schemes
```

The choice is frozen for a given experiment or benchmark before tension values are computed.

### 3.8 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

An **encoding tuple** for Q004 is a record:

```txt
Enc_HC_tuple =
  (
    Profile_subset,
    HodgeDim_source_choice,
    CycleDim_source_choice,
    Indicator_mode_choice,
    Weight_pair_choice,
    Aggregation_scheme_choice,
    Refinement_schedule
  )
```

where:

* `Profile_subset` is a finite subset of `Lib_variety_profiles`,
* `HodgeDim_source_choice` is a member of `Lib_dimension_sources_Hodge`,
* `CycleDim_source_choice` is a member of `Lib_dimension_sources_cycle`,
* `Indicator_mode_choice` is a member of `Lib_indicator_modes`,
* `Weight_pair_choice` is a member of `Lib_weight_pairs`,
* `Aggregation_scheme_choice` is a member of `Lib_aggregation_schemes`,
* `Refinement_schedule` is a countable increasing sequence of refinement levels `r`.

Fairness constraints:

* For any batch of experiments or evaluations, one must:

  * choose an `Enc_HC_tuple`,
  * publish its full description or a stable hash,
  * then run all computations under that fixed tuple.
* The tuple cannot be adapted in response to detailed tension results for the same batch.
* Different tuples may be explored across independent experiments, but each experiment must be auditable from its published tuple.

The admissible encoding class `Enc_HC` consists of all encoding tuples that respect:

* the observable definitions above,
* the finite libraries and fairness constraints,
* the singular set and domain restrictions described next.

### 3.9 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may fail to carry coherent or stable data for Q004 observables. We collect such states in a singular set:

```txt
S_sing_HC =
  {
    m in M_HC :
      for some admissible (X, k) in m,
      at least one of the following holds:

      Hodge_space_dim(m; X, k) undefined or negative
      Alg_cycle_span_dim(m; X, k) undefined or negative
      HodgeDim_source(m; X, k) not in Lib_dimension_sources_Hodge
      CycleDim_source(m; X, k) not in Lib_dimension_sources_cycle
      Lib_class_tests(X, k) missing or not constructed by the declared rule
      Lib_eff(X, k, m) empty
      Hodge_class_score or Alg_class_score unstable under the declared tolerance
  }
```

We restrict all Q004 tension analysis to the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg_HC = M_HC \ S_sing_HC
```

If a protocol attempts to evaluate `Tension_HC(m; X, k)` or `Tension_HC_total(m)` for `m` in `S_sing_HC`, the result is treated as “out of domain” rather than as evidence about the truth or falsity of the Hodge Conjecture.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q004 is characterized as a tension problem within the Tension Universe framework, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Classical statement in tension friendly form

Classically, for each smooth projective variety `X` and index `k`:

* There is a rational cohomology group `H^{2k}(X, Q)`.
* Inside it there is the Hodge subspace of degree `(k, k)`.
* Inside `H^{2k}(X, Q)` there is a subspace generated by algebraic cycles of codimension `k`.

The Hodge Conjecture states that these two subspaces coincide after tensoring with `Q` and that every Hodge class is algebraic.

In the tension viewpoint, this becomes a statement that:

* a cohomological space admits two descriptions:

  * one coming from analytic Hodge theory,
  * one coming from algebraic cycles,
* and the conjecture claims that these descriptions are perfectly consistent in the sense that there is no persistent, scale stable gap between them.

### 4.2 Hodge consistency as low tension

At the effective layer we encode Hodge consistency as the requirement that for each admissible `(X, k)` and each world representing state `m` in `M_reg_HC`, the Hodge tension functional satisfies:

```txt
Tension_HC(m; X, k) <= epsilon_HC(X, k)
```

for some small threshold `epsilon_HC(X, k)` in `[0, 1]` that depends on:

* the profile of `(X, k)`,
* the refinement level `r`,
* and the known analytic and geometric uncertainties,

but does not grow unbounded as refinement increases or as more detailed data are incorporated.

In this view, the Hodge Conjecture becomes a low tension principle:

> For every admissible variety and degree, there exist encodings of the real world within `Enc_HC` where the Hodge tension remains in a stable low band across refinements.

### 4.3 Hodge failure as persistent high tension

Conversely, if the Hodge Conjecture is false, then for at least one admissible `(X, k)` and for any encoding in `Enc_HC` that remains faithful to the actual cohomological and cycle structure, the tension is expected to exhibit a positive lower bound.

Formally, there should exist a positive constant `delta_HC(X, k)` in `(0, 1]` such that for all sufficiently refined states `m` representing that world:

```txt
Tension_HC(m; X, k) >= delta_HC(X, k)
```

where `delta_HC(X, k)` cannot be removed by adjusting parameters within the admissible encoding class, without violating fairness or contradicting known mathematics.

At the effective layer, Q004 is therefore represented as the choice between:

* a world where analytic and algebraic faces of cohomology can be jointly encoded with low and stable tension,
* and a world where any faithful encoding must exhibit a persistent high tension band for at least one `(X, k)`.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline two counterfactual worlds, described entirely at the level of observables and tension functionals.

* World T: Hodge Conjecture true (low and stable Hodge tension).
* World F: Hodge Conjecture false (persistent high Hodge tension for some `(X, k)`).

These scenarios do not construct internal TU fields from raw data. They only state patterns that observables and tension scores would follow in each case.

### 5.1 World T (Hodge Conjecture true, low tension world)

In World T we assume that the Hodge Conjecture is true for all admissible varieties and degrees.

Effective layer behavior:

1. **Subspace agreement**

   For each admissible `(X, k)` and for each world representing state `m_T` at sufficiently high refinement:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_space(m_T; X, k) is zero or very small
   ```

   compared to a noise band determined by known uncertainties and by the TU Tension Scale Charter.

2. **Class level matching**

   For each `(X, k)` and for `Lib_class_tests(X, k)` in a world state `m_T` we have:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_class(m_T; X, k) tends to zero
   ```

   as refinement increases. Encoded Hodge like test classes admit matching algebraic like classes in the limit, within the tolerance model.

3. **Stable tension under refinement**

   For a fixed choice of `(alpha, beta)` from `Lib_weight_pairs` and a fixed `Enc_HC_tuple`, the sequence:

   ```txt
   Tension_HC(m_T(r); X, k)
   ```

   as `r` increases, forms a bounded and slowly varying sequence that stays inside a low tension band.

4. **Aggregate behavior**

   For states `m_T` that encode several `(X, k)` pairs, the aggregate tension `Tension_HC_total(m_T)` remains low and changes smoothly under refinement, without sudden spikes that cannot be attributed to known approximation errors or data updates.

### 5.2 World F (Hodge Conjecture false, high tension world)

In World F we assume that the Hodge Conjecture is false for at least one admissible `(X, k)`.

Effective layer behavior:

1. **Subspace gap persists**

   There exists at least one admissible `(X, k)` such that for all world representing `m_F` at sufficiently high refinement:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_space(m_F; X, k) >= c_space(X, k) > 0
   ```

   where `c_space(X, k)` is a positive constant that does not vanish as approximation improves.

2. **Class level mismatch persists**

   For the same `(X, k)` there is a positive lower bound:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_class(m_F; X, k) >= c_class(X, k) > 0
   ```

   that does not shrink under admissible refinements within the chosen `Enc_HC_tuple`.

3. **Tension band separation**

   For that `(X, k)` and any admissible encoding consistent with the observed structure, the tension satisfies:

   ```txt
   Tension_HC(m_F; X, k) >= delta_HC(X, k) > 0
   ```

   for all sufficiently large refinement levels, where `delta_HC(X, k)` is independent of small changes within the finite encoding libraries.

4. **Aggregate behavior**

   In aggregate states `m_F` that contain the problematic `(X, k)` as well as other pairs, the total tension `Tension_HC_total(m_F)` exhibits a positive gap relative to the low tension band that cannot be removed without:

   * violating fairness constraints,
   * ignoring parts of the data.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds are not proofs or disproofs. They are statements about how:

* subspace and class level mismatches,
* and the resulting tension functionals,

would behave in hypothetical worlds where the conjecture is true or false. The purpose is to make the conjecture visible as a structured pattern of low or high tension, not to provide a constructive resolution.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence and robustness of Q004 encodings,
* distinguish between different Hodge tension models,
* provide evidence about whether particular choices of observables and weights are useful.

These experiments do not prove or disprove the Hodge Conjecture. They can only falsify or refine particular TU encodings of Q004.

### Experiment 1: Encoding stability on benchmark varieties (E2 harness)

**Goal**
Test whether a fixed `Enc_HC_tuple` produces stable, low Hodge tension across a benchmark library of varieties where Hodge structures and algebraic cycles are well studied, and define a reproducible harness that others can rerun.

**Setup**

* Choose a finite benchmark set `Lib_bench` of pairs `(X_i, k_i)` drawn from `Lib_variety_profiles`. A natural first choice, if one wants to minimize external prerequisites, is the divisor case:

  * `k = 1`,
  * varieties for which the Lefschetz `(1,1)` theorem applies and both Hodge and algebraic cycle data are well documented.
* Before looking at any detailed tension values, fix an `Enc_HC_tuple`:

  * a subset of `Lib_variety_profiles` that includes all profiles used in `Lib_bench`,
  * a specific `HodgeDim_source_choice` and `CycleDim_source_choice`,
  * one indicator mode from `Lib_indicator_modes` (for example `Hard01_with_unknown`),
  * one weight pair `(alpha, beta)` from `Lib_weight_pairs`,
  * one aggregation scheme (for example `Profile_stratified_mean`),
  * a discrete sequence of refinement levels `r_1 < r_2 < ... < r_R`.
* Publish:

  * the full tuple, or
  * a content hash together with a machine readable parameter file that describes all choices.

**Protocol**

1. For each benchmark pair `(X_i, k_i)` and each refinement level `r_j`, construct a state `m_i(r_j)` in `M_reg_HC` that encodes:

   * approximate Hodge space dimensions derived from the chosen `HodgeDim_source_choice`,
   * approximate algebraic cycle span dimensions derived from `CycleDim_source_choice`,
   * a fixed test library `Lib_class_tests(X_i, k_i)` constructed by the declared rule,
   * stable soft scores and indicators for all `v` in `Lib_class_tests(X_i, k_i)` under the chosen indicator mode.
2. For each `m_i(r_j)` compute:

   * `DeltaS_space(m_i(r_j); X_i, k_i)`,
   * `DeltaS_class(m_i(r_j); X_i, k_i)`,
   * `Tension_HC(m_i(r_j); X_i, k_i)` using the fixed `(alpha, beta)`.
3. For each `m_i(r_j)` compute the aggregate `Tension_HC_total(m_i(r_j))` using `Agg_scheme(m_i(r_j))`.
4. Record the sequences:

   * `Tension_HC(m_i(r_j); X_i, k_i)` as a function of `r_j`,
   * `Tension_HC_total(m_i(r_j))` as a function of `r_j`,
     together with all metadata and the encoding tuple hash.

**Metrics**

* For each `(X_i, k_i)`:

  * behavior of `Tension_HC(m_i(r_j); X_i, k_i)` as a function of `r_j`,
  * whether the sequence appears bounded and stabilizing inside a low tension band.
* Across `Lib_bench`:

  * distribution of local tensions at each refinement level,
  * distribution of aggregate tensions at each refinement level,
  * fraction of benchmark objects where tensions stay below a pre agreed `epsilon_HC(X_i, k_i)`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for most objects in `Lib_bench`, the tension sequences:

  * oscillate wildly without converging to a low band, or
  * exhibit growth that cannot be explained by known approximation errors,
    then the current choice of observables or the functional form of `Tension_HC` is considered falsified at the encoding level.
* If small variations within the same finite libraries (for example minor changes in `Lib_class_tests` construction) produce arbitrarily large swings in tension for the same benchmark objects, the encoding is considered ill posed and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
This experiment uses the hybrid interpretation of Section 0.1: cohomological data are treated as continuous vector space structures, while cycle spans and class indicators are treated as discrete summaries. All computations observe the chosen indicator mode and the TU Tension Scale Charter.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a Q004 encoding in this harness does not solve the Hodge Conjecture. It only shows that a particular encoding or parameter choice is not a good effective layer representation.

---

### Experiment 2: AI assisted classification of Hodge like vs algebraic like classes

**Goal**
Assess whether Q004 encodings supply useful signals for an AI system to distinguish between classes that are likely algebraic and classes that are likely non algebraic in model or synthetic data.

**Setup**

* Construct or select synthetic model worlds where:

  * for each model variety `X_model` and degree `k_model` there is a known ground truth about which classes are algebraic,
  * Hodge type structures and cycle spans can be simulated consistently with a chosen `Enc_HC_tuple`.
* Prepare two versions of an AI model:

  * Baseline model without Q004 tension signals.
  * TU augmented model that receives `DeltaS_space`, `DeltaS_class`, and `Tension_HC` based signals during training or evaluation.

**Protocol**

1. For each synthetic `(X_model, k_model)` and each class `v` in a test set:

   * generate a state `m_model` encoding the relevant summaries,
   * compute `DeltaS_space(m_model; X_model, k_model)`,
   * compute `DeltaS_class(m_model; X_model, k_model)`,
   * compute `Tension_HC(m_model; X_model, k_model)`.
2. Provide the baseline model with:

   * textual descriptions of `X_model`, `k_model`, and class `v`,
   * labels indicating whether `v` is algebraic in the synthetic ground truth.
3. Provide the TU augmented model with:

   * the same inputs as the baseline,
   * plus one or more of the tension related signals.
4. Train or evaluate both models on the same classification task:

   * predict whether `v` is algebraic or not.

**Metrics**

* Classification accuracy on held out synthetic data.
* Calibration measures such as:

  * alignment between confidence scores and actual correctness.
* Robustness under variation of synthetic families.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the TU augmented model does not improve classification accuracy or calibration compared to the baseline across a variety of synthetic families, then:

  * the Q004 encoding is considered ineffective for this type of task and may need to be revised.
* If the TU augmented model systematically assigns lower tension to classes that the synthetic ground truth marks as non algebraic, while giving higher tension to classes that are algebraic, the encoding is misaligned and must be rejected or redesigned.

**Boundary note**
Success or failure of this AI classification task tests only the usefulness of the Q004 encoding as a signal, not the truth of the Hodge Conjecture.

---

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q004 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We outline several training signals that can be derived from Q004 observables.

1. `signal_hodge_space_gap`

   * Definition: a normalized version of `DeltaS_space(m; X, k)` for the current context.
   * Use: encourages internal representations where the encoded Hodge subspace and algebraic cycle span subspace have dimensions that match when the context assumes Hodge type behavior.

2. `signal_hodge_class_mismatch`

   * Definition: equal to `DeltaS_class(m; X, k)` for a suitable test library of classes, possibly aggregated over `(X, k)` using the active aggregation scheme.
   * Use: penalizes internal states that treat many Hodge like classes as non algebraic when the context presumes the Hodge Conjecture.

3. `signal_hc_tension_total`

   * Definition: equal to a rescaled version of `Tension_HC_total(m)` for the current multi pair state, mapped into a fixed range, for example `[0, 1]`.
   * Use: provides a coarse summary of overall Hodge tension in the current reasoning state that can be minimized in certain tasks.

4. `signal_counterfactual_split_HC`

   * Definition: a measure of how well the model separates reasoning under Hodge true vs Hodge false assumptions, based on differences in tension signals across carefully paired prompts.
   * Use: encourages the model to keep track of which world assumption it is using and to avoid mixing them.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We propose several module patterns that reuse Q004 components.

1. `HodgeTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a geometric or cohomological context, output an estimated `Tension_HC_total(m)` and decomposed components such as `DeltaS_space` and `DeltaS_class`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings for the context, plus identifiers for `(X, k)` when available.
     * Outputs: scalar tension score and a small vector of mismatch components.

2. `CohomologyFieldDescriptor`

   * Role: extract compact summaries of Hodge numbers, algebraic cycle spans, and possible class test sets from the internal state of the model.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embedding describing a variety and a degree index.
     * Outputs: a structured representation that can feed into the HodgeTensionHead.

3. `HC_ConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: check candidate claims about algebraic cycles and Hodge classes for consistency with low tension configurations.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal representations of claims such as “this class is algebraic” or “these cycles span the Hodge subspace”.
     * Outputs: soft scores or masks that indicate whether the claims are consistent with the Hodge tension encoding for the context.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

To assess the impact of Q004 modules in an AI system, we can define an evaluation harness.

1. **Task selection**

   * Choose benchmarks involving:

     * explanations of Hodge theory and algebraic cycles at intermediate to advanced level,
     * reasoning problems where the distinction between Hodge and algebraic classes is important,
     * contextual questions linking geometry to arithmetic via cohomology.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline condition: AI model without Q004 modules or signals.
   * TU condition: same model family with `HodgeTensionHead`, `CohomologyFieldDescriptor`, and `HC_ConsistencyFilter` active, and with training signals as in 7.1.

3. **Metrics**

   * Accuracy on structured questions about Hodge theory and algebraic cycles.
   * Internal consistency across multi step explanations:

     * number of contradictions detected by checking whether the claims remain in a low tension band.
   * Stability under counterfactual prompts that explicitly toggle “assume Hodge Conjecture” vs “assume Hodge Conjecture fails”.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol that external users can run to experience the effect of Q004 encoding.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt the AI with:

    * “Explain the Hodge Conjecture and how it relates algebraic cycles and Hodge classes. Describe what would count as evidence for or against it.”
  * Record the explanation and note:

    * how clearly algebraic cycles and Hodge classes are distinguished,
    * whether the explanation identifies structural tests or only gives informal motivation.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt the same AI system with:

    * “Using the idea of a tension between algebraic cycles and Hodge cohomology classes, explain the Hodge Conjecture. Describe how one could measure this tension and what patterns a ‘Hodge true’ world would show compared to a ‘Hodge false’ world.”
  * Record the explanation and:

    * any auxiliary tension scores provided by Q004 modules.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Use a simple rubric rating:

    * structure and organization of the explanation,
    * explicit statement of what would be observed in the two counterfactual worlds,
    * clarity about what is known and what is unknown.

* **What to log**

  * Prompts and responses for both setups,
  * any internal tension scores or decomposed mismatch components,
  * any flags from `HC_ConsistencyFilter` indicating contradictions.

This protocol stays at the effective layer and does not reveal any hidden TU generative rules.

---

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q004 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `HodgeTensionFunctional_HC`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `cohomology_summary`, `cycle_summary`
     * Output: `tension_value` in `[0, 1]` representing a combined measure of normalized subspace and class level mismatch.
   * Preconditions:

     * The summaries refer to the same variety and degree index and are compatible in the sense that a Hodge decomposition and cycle span are both encoded.

2. ComponentName: `CohomologyCycleDescriptor`

   * Type: field
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: description of a geometric or cohomological context (for example variety type and degree).
     * Output: finite vector of features encoding Hodge numbers, algebraic cycle span dimensions, and basic intersection data.
   * Preconditions:

     * The input context lies in the admissible variety profile library.

3. ComponentName: `HC_Counterfactual_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: model class of geometric or cohomological objects.
     * Output: a pair of experiment descriptions corresponding to:

       * a “Hodge true” world where one attempts to enforce low Hodge tension,
       * a “Hodge false” world where tension is allowed and monitored.
   * Preconditions:

     * The model class supports coherent encoding of cohomology and cycle summaries.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q003 (BH_MATH_BSD_L3_003)

   * Reused components: `CohomologyCycleDescriptor`, `HC_Counterfactual_Template`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * BSD involves cohomology of elliptic curves and the relationship between analytic L functions and algebraic ranks, which can be seen as a low dimensional instance of Hodge like consistency.
   * What changes:

     * The cohomology summaries focus on rank and torsion structures rather than general Hodge numbers,
     * the cycle summaries focus on rational points and divisors.

2. Q013 (BH_MATH_LANG_L3_013)

   * Reused component: `HodgeTensionFunctional_HC`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Langlands type correspondences relate motives and automorphic representations. The Hodge tension functional measures how well geometric realizations of motives line up with their expected cohomological profiles.
   * What changes:

     * The input summaries are expanded to include representation theoretic data in addition to geometric and cohomological data.

3. Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)

   * Reused component: `HC_Counterfactual_Template`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Information theoretic systems can be decomposed into structured “cycle generated” parts and ambient noise. The Hodge style world T vs world F comparison translates into low vs high tension between these parts.
   * What changes:

     * The underlying “cohomology” becomes an information space, and “cycles” become structured recurrent patterns rather than algebraic subvarieties.

These transfers keep all reasoning at the effective layer and reuse only field and functional interfaces, not any hidden TU construction rules.

---

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains where Q004 sits on the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E2**

  * A coherent, encoding level falsifiable specification for the Hodge Conjecture has been provided:

    * state space `M_HC` and regular domain `M_reg_HC`,
    * observable families for Hodge dimensions, cycle dimensions, and class scores,
    * normalized mismatch quantities `DeltaS_space` and `DeltaS_class`,
    * combined tension functional `Tension_HC` in `[0, 1]`,
    * finite libraries for dimension sources, indicator modes, weight pairs, aggregation schemes,
    * an explicit E2 harness (Experiment 1) that can be implemented as a reproducible pipeline.

* **N_level: N1**

  * A narrative has been given that:

    * explains HC as consistency_tension between analytic Hodge and algebraic cycle descriptions,
    * introduces world T and world F scenarios,
    * outlines experiments that test encodings rather than the conjecture itself.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward higher E levels

To move Q004 further up the E ladder, at least one of the following should be implemented and published:

1. A concrete prototype pipeline that:

   * takes as input numerical or symbolic data for a small benchmark library of varieties and degrees,
   * instantiates a specific `Enc_HC_tuple`,
   * constructs approximate states `m` in `M_reg_HC`,
   * computes and publishes `DeltaS_space`, `DeltaS_class`, `Tension_HC(m; X, k)`, and `Tension_HC_total(m)` values for each object.

2. A full implementation of Experiment 1 with:

   * a clearly documented benchmark set `Lib_bench`,
   * fixed encoding choices from the finite libraries,
   * published tension trajectories for each `(X_i, k_i)` and each refinement level,
   * analysis of stability and bounds,
   * a published spec hash and parameter file that allow independent reruns.

Both steps operate entirely on observable summaries and respect the fairness constraints. They do not expose any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Longer term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q004 is expected to serve as:

* the main geometric example of consistency_tension between:

  * analytic structures (Hodge decomposition),
  * algebraic structures (cycle classes),
* a template for encoding other standard conjectures involving cohomology and cycles, such as:

  * Grothendieck standard conjectures,
  * variants of Bloch–Beilinson conjectures in a tension setting,
* a bridge between:

  * purely mathematical problems in algebraic geometry,
  * physical and information theoretic problems with similar “cycle vs ambient” structure.

As other problems reach higher E and N levels, their interactions with Q004 will refine the libraries and fairness constraints, while keeping the effective layer boundary intact.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non technical explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer description.

The Hodge Conjecture is about a very rich kind of shape called a smooth projective complex variety. For each such shape, there are two ways to describe certain hidden “directions” inside it.

1. One description comes from analysis. You look at special differential forms on the shape, decompose them into pieces of type `(p, q)`, and pick out the pieces of type `(k, k)`. These pieces form what is called the Hodge `(k, k)` part of the cohomology.

2. The other description comes from geometry. You take subvarieties of codimension `k` inside the shape, treat them as “higher dimensional surfaces”, and look at the cohomology classes they create. Taking rational linear combinations of these classes gives the algebraic cycle subspace.

The Hodge Conjecture says that these two ways of finding cohomology classes in degree `2k` should be equivalent. Every class that looks like a Hodge `(k, k)` class should actually come from algebraic cycles.

In the Tension Universe view we do not try to build those structures from scratch or to prove the conjecture. Instead we:

* imagine a space of states where each state summarizes, in a finite way:

  * the Hodge `(k, k)` part,
  * the part generated by algebraic cycles,
* define numbers that measure:

  * how far the normalized dimensions of these two parts differ,
  * how many “Hodge like” test classes fail to appear as algebraic classes in a stable way.

We combine these numbers into a single Hodge tension score that always lies between `0` and `1`. Then we ask:

* In a world where the Hodge Conjecture is true, can we keep this tension score small and stable for all relevant shapes as our descriptions become more precise?
* In a world where the Hodge Conjecture is false, are there shapes for which the tension score is forced to stay noticeably positive no matter how we refine our descriptions, under the same frozen encoding rules?

This framework does not decide which world we live in. It does:

* turn the conjecture into a precise statement about low or high tension between two kinds of structure,
* provide observable quantities and experimental protocols for testing whether particular encodings of that tension are reasonable,
* produce reusable tools that can also be applied to other problems where analytic data and algebraic or geometric data are supposed to match.

Q004 is therefore the geometric counterpart of spectral and arithmetic problems like the Riemann Hypothesis. It shows how the Tension Universe handles very hard open questions by talking about:

* what patterns a low tension world would show,
* what patterns a high tension world would show,

while remaining strictly at the effective layer and leaving deep generative rules outside the scope of this document.

---

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M_HC`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer.
* No step in this file gives a constructive mapping from raw experimental or simulation data into internal Tension Universe fields.
* No step exposes any deep TU generative rule or any first principle axiom system.

### Encoding and fairness

* Admissible encoding classes, reference profiles and weight families used in this page are constrained by shared Tension Universe charters:

  * [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* For every encoding class referenced here:

  * its definition, parameter ranges and reference families are fixed at the charter level before any problem specific tuning,
  * these choices may depend on general physical or mathematical considerations and on public benchmark selections, but not on the unknown truth value of this specific problem,
  * no encoding is allowed to hide the canonical answer as an uninterpreted field, label or parameter,
  * encoding tuples used in experiments must be frozen and auditable, and any change after seeing detailed results invalidates the corresponding run.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All mismatch terms `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals in this file are treated as dimensionless or normalized quantities, defined up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* For Q004 this includes explicit normalization of:

  * subspace gaps by Hodge dimensions,
  * class level mismatches by the number of effective Hodge like test classes.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_HC`, `delta_HC`, and experiment cutoffs are always interpreted relative to that fixed scale.
* Changing the tension scale requires an explicit update of the TU Tension Scale Charter, not an edit of individual problem files.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* Experiments described in this document are tests of Tension Universe encodings and pipelines, not tests of the underlying canonical problem itself.
* The rule “falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement” applies globally, even where it is not restated.
* When required observables cannot be reliably estimated in practice, the outcome of the corresponding experiment is recorded as “inconclusive”, not as confirmation.
* Encoding level failures discovered by experiments lead to revision or retirement of encodings under the charters, not to reinterpretation of established mathematical results.

### Non mutation and versioning

* Definitions and symbols in this file are frozen for this version.
* Revisions, if needed, must be published as a new versioned file or as a clearly documented changelog entry.
* Historical versions remain valid descriptions of the encodings used in earlier experiments and should not be silently overwritten.

### Program note

* This page is an experimental specification within the ongoing WFGY / Tension Universe research program.
* All structures and parameter choices are provisional and may be revised in future versions, subject to the constraints above.
* The intention is to make extremely hard open problems accessible at the effective layer through:

  * explicit state spaces and observables,
  * normalized tension scores,
  * reproducible, falsifiable experimental harnesses,
    while keeping deep generative rules and any candidate first principles outside the scope of public S problem files.
