## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this file are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the candidate Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of Q112 is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the classical free will problem as a structured tension between physical closure, agency, and responsibility.
* This document does **not** claim to prove or disprove any canonical position about free will, determinism, or responsibility. It does not identify any metaphysical view as correct.
* It does **not** introduce new theorems, axioms, or laws of nature beyond what is already present in the cited literature. All references to physics, neuroscience, and philosophy are interpretive and remain within standard domains.
* We assume only that there exist TU compatible models in which the described state spaces, observables, and tension functionals can be instantiated. We do **not** specify any underlying generative rules, dynamics, or mappings from raw empirical data to TU internal fields.
* All observables, fields, and tension quantities are defined at a coarse grained, scenario based level suitable for experiments and engineering use. They are not claims about any fundamental microstructure of reality.

The labels

```txt
E_level: E1
N_level: N1
```

have the following internal meaning inside TU:

* **E1 (encoding level)**
  An explicit effective-layer encoding is provided:

  * a state space of scenarios,
  * observables and mismatch components,
  * a combined tension functional with clearly stated parameters,
  * a singular set and regular domain,
  * at least one experiment with explicit falsification conditions.

* **N1 (narrative level)**
  A structured narrative is provided that connects:

  * the canonical philosophical debate,
  * the TU encoding,
  * counterfactual world patterns,
  * cross problem transfers and engineering uses.

Higher E and N levels would require implemented systems, published datasets, and multi problem integrations beyond the scope of this file.

This encoding is intended to be read together with the TU Effective Layer Charter, the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter, and the TU Tension Scale Charter, which govern effective-layer scope, encoding fairness, and tension scale conventions.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The classical free will problem asks how, if at all, human or agent level freedom and control over actions can coexist with the following three pressures:

1. A world that is **physically closed** in the sense that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause inside the physical domain.
2. Laws of nature that may be deterministic or probabilistic but do not obviously include extra non physical interventions.
3. Normative practices that ascribe responsibility, praise, and blame to agents.

A central formulation is:

> Are free will and physical determinism compatible, and under what conditions can an agent be genuinely responsible for actions in a physically closed world?

Common theory families include:

* **Compatibilist theses**
  Free will is compatible with determinism and physical closure. Freedom is linked to the right kind of dependence on reasons, character, or internal states, not to the absence of determining causes.

* **Incompatibilist theses**
  Strong free will, understood as robust ability to do otherwise given the same past and same laws, is not compatible with determinism.

* **Libertarian theses**
  Genuine free will exists. Therefore determinism or strict physical closure must fail in some way at points that matter for agency.

* **Hard determinist or hard compatibilist theses**
  Physical closure and determinism are true, and strong free will either does not exist or is not needed for responsibility once that term is revised.

Within TU and the BlackHole project, Q112 is not a proof problem. It is a **reframing problem**:

* Encode the free will debate as a structured tension between physical closure, agency, and responsibility at the effective layer.
* Provide a framework in which different free will theories correspond to different tension patterns rather than yes or no answers.

In this sense the status field

```txt
Status: Reframed_only
```

means:

* Only an effective-layer encoding is supplied.
* No claim is made here that the canonical free will problem has been solved.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

There is no consensus solution to the free will problem. The following points summarize its status:

* **No consensus answer**
  Philosophers defend compatibilist, libertarian, hard determinist, and revisionist views with detailed internal structure, but none has displaced the others.

* **Multiple stable positions**
  Different positions balance intuitions about control, moral responsibility, and scientific description in different ways. These positions persist even when shared evidence is taken into account.

* **Strong cross domain entanglement**
  Free will debates interact with:

  * metaphysics of laws, causation, and modality,
  * philosophy of mind and mental causation,
  * ethics and moral responsibility,
  * cognitive science and neuroscience of decision making.

* **Conceptual drift under scientific change**
  As physics and neuroscience evolve, the background picture of determinism, randomness, and brain dynamics changes. This puts pressure on earlier definitions of free will and responsibility.

The difficulty is not mainly in proving a technical theorem. It lies in:

* stabilizing a concept of agency that remains robust as physical descriptions become more detailed,
* keeping responsibility judgments coherent and non trivial when background theories of physics change,
* avoiding degenerate positions that either declare every action free or declare no action meaningfully free.

Q112 treats this as a **structured compatibility problem** instead of a binary question.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q112 plays three roles.

1. It is the central **cognitive_tension** node for questions about **agency and choice under physical closure**. It connects to:

   * mind body relation (Q111),
   * personal identity and responsibility over time (Q113),
   * AI agency and alignment (Q121),
   * interpretability of agent like systems (Q123).

2. It provides a reusable encoding of free will as a **three component tension**:

   * physical closure mismatch,
   * agency mismatch,
   * responsibility mismatch.

3. It serves as a testbed for **hybrid encodings** that combine:

   * physically continuous descriptions of systems,
   * discrete option structures and normative judgments.

This makes Q112 a bridge between human level agency debates and machine level decision architectures inside TU.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q112 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge has a one line reason pointing to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites and framing.

* **Q111 (BH_PHIL_MIND_BODY_L3_111)**
  Reason: Supplies the mind body effective encoding and physical closure versus mental reality framing needed for free will tension components.

* **Q026 (BH_PHYS_QM_MEAS_L3_026)**
  Reason: Provides constraints from quantum measurement and determinism or indeterminism that shape the physical closure mismatch component.

* **Q117 (BH_PHIL_SCIENCE_REALISM_L3_117)**
  Reason: Anchors how laws, causation, and modality are treated when formulating consequence arguments about free will.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These directly reuse Q112 components.

* **Q113 (BH_PHIL_PERSONAL_ID_L3_113)**
  Reason: Reuses agency and responsibility mismatch components to encode identity over time and responsibility persistence.

* **Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)**
  Reason: Depends on free will and agency tension when describing autonomous AI agents and their alignment constraints.

* **Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)**
  Reason: Uses Q112 free will tension structures to interpret internal AI states as actions or decisions under constraints.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* **Q111 (BH_PHIL_MIND_BODY_L3_111)**
  Reason: Both encode cognitive_tension between mental level narratives and physical descriptions, with Q112 focused on choice and control.

* **Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)**
  Reason: Both involve explanatory gaps between felt experience and physical accounts; one for consciousness, one for decisions.

* **Q118 (BH_PHIL_REF_LOGIC_L3_118)**
  Reason: Both explore limits of formal representation for complex human level phenomena, one in logic and one in agency.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q112 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)**
  Reason: Reuses templates for linking micro level dynamics and macro level constraints, applied here to choice and control.

* **Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)**
  Reason: Shares patterns where local dynamics obey strict laws while higher level variables behave with effective freedom like behavior.

* **Q083 (BH_NEURO_CODE_L3_083)**
  Reason: Uses agency and responsibility mismatch when relating neural codes to reported decisions and control.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state space,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any explicit mapping from raw data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space and admissible encodings

We assume a state space

```txt
M
```

where each element `m` is a free will scenario. At the effective layer, a scenario encodes:

* a physical description of a system and its dynamics over a finite time window,
* an agent level description of options, intentions, and reported decisions,
* a normative description of responsibility ascriptions and related rules in that scenario.

We also assume a finite library of admissible free will encodings

```txt
L_FW = { E_1, E_2, ..., E_K }
```

Each `E_k` is a fixed recipe, chosen in advance, that assigns values to the observables listed below for any `m` in `M` where the encoding is defined. We do not specify how `E_k` is implemented from raw data.

The TU Encoding and Fairness Charter constrains this library as follows:

* The library `L_FW` is finite.
* Each `E_k` is specified before any evaluation of tension on the datasets used in the experiments associated with Q112.
* Once an experiment is selected, the encoding `E_k` to be used is fixed before seeing the evaluation data.
* Encodings are not selected or modified adaptively to hide high tension values that have already been observed.

These conditions prevent choosing encodings after the fact to artificially reduce tension.

### 3.2 Effective observables

For any admissible encoding `E_k` we define the following observables on `M`.

1. **Physical closure mismatch**

```txt
DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k) >= 0
```

* A scalar that measures how far the scenario `m` deviates from the ideal that every physical event has a sufficient physical cause inside the physical domain, relative to the closure assumption encoded in `E_k`.
* Value zero means: according to `E_k`, physical closure is fully satisfied in the relevant part of the scenario.

2. **Agency mismatch**

```txt
DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k) >= 0
```

* A scalar that measures the gap between:

  * the options and control that the agent appears to have at the scenario description level,
  * and the options and control that are actually available given the physical and contextual constraints represented in `E_k`.

* Value zero means: apparent agency and effective agency coincide for the purposes of this encoding.

3. **Responsibility mismatch**

```txt
DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k) >= 0
```

* A scalar that measures the tension between:

  * the control and knowledge conditions assigned to the agent in `m`,
  * and the responsibility judgments, praise, blame, or punishment attributed in `m`.

* Value zero means: responsibility ascriptions match control and knowledge conditions according to `E_k`.

4. **Theory mode label**

```txt
Mode_FW(m) in { compatibilist, libertarian, hard_determinist, other }
```

* A label describing which class of free will theory the scenario is assumed to instantiate.
* This is a categorical tag used to interpret and compare tension levels, not a deep generative rule.

### 3.3 Combined free will tension

For each encoding `E_k` we define a combined free will tension functional:

```txt
Tension_FW(m; E_k)
  = b_phys * DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)
  + b_agency * DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)
  + b_resp * DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)
```

where the weights satisfy

```txt
b_phys >= 0
b_agency >= 0
b_resp >= 0
b_phys + b_agency + b_resp = 1
```

The TU Encoding and Fairness Charter constrains these weights through a finite set

```txt
W_FW = { (b_phys, b_agency, b_resp) }
```

with the following rules:

* For a given experiment, a single triple in `W_FW` is selected **in advance**, based on theoretical considerations and the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* The same triple is used for all scenarios in that experiment.
* Weight triples are not tuned to individual scenarios or retrofitted to reduce tension on already observed cases.

This locks the degrees of freedom that could otherwise be used to hide tension after the fact.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor

Consistent with the TU core, for each scenario `m`, encoding `E_k`, and weight triple in `W_FW`, we define a tension tensor:

```txt
T_ij(m; E_k) = S_i(m; E_k) * C_j(m; E_k)
             * Tension_FW(m; E_k) * lambda(m; E_k) * kappa_FW
```

where:

* `S_i(m; E_k)` is a source like factor for the i-th semantic source component (for example, how strongly closure claims are asserted in the narrative).
* `C_j(m; E_k)` is a receptivity like factor for the j-th cognitive or downstream component (for example, how sensitive downstream judgments are to violations of agency).
* `lambda(m; E_k)` encodes local convergence or divergence status of reasoning about scenario `m`.
* `kappa_FW` is a global coupling constant for the free will tension encoding.

The detailed indices `i` and `j` are not needed at the effective layer. It is sufficient that `T_ij(m; E_k)` is well defined and finite for all relevant indices when `m` is in the regular domain.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restriction

Some scenarios may lead to undefined or unbounded mismatch values. For example:

* incomplete or inconsistent physical descriptions,
* missing or contradictory responsibility assignments,
* unresolved ambiguity about who the relevant agent is.

We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  for all admissible E_k in L_FW,
  at least one of
  DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k),
  DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k),
  DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)
  is undefined or not finite
}
```

and the regular domain

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

The rule for Q112 is:

* All evaluations of `Tension_FW` and all tension based experiments are restricted to `M_reg`.
* When an experiment would require evaluating `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` for `m` in `S_sing`, the scenario is treated as **out of scope** for Q112 rather than as evidence for or against any free will theory.

This is a domain restriction treatment of singularities. It does not regularize the values. It simply excludes them from the effective analysis of tension.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q112 is characterized as a tension problem within TU.

### 4.1 Core free will tension principle

The core principle is that, for a given theory mode and encoding, a healthy free will theory should admit many realistic scenarios with **low tension**, while theories that are badly matched to our practices and physics will produce **persistent high tension**.

For each theory mode `mode` and admissible encoding `E_k` we use

```txt
Tension_FW(m; E_k)
  = b_phys * DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)
  + b_agency * DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)
  + b_resp * DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)
```

interpreted as follows:

* Low `Tension_FW` indicates better fit between physical closure, agency, and responsibility for that scenario under that theory mode and encoding.
* Persistent high `Tension_FW` across realistic scenarios indicates mismatch that the theory or encoding must address.

Q112 does not claim that any specific theory mode is correct. It only supplies a way to measure how well each mode fits particular clusters of scenarios at the effective layer.

### 4.2 Low tension free will worlds

For a fixed theory mode and encoding `E_k`, we say that a family of scenarios `{ m_r }` indexed by a resolution parameter `r` forms a **low tension world** if there exists a small threshold

```txt
epsilon_FW > 0
```

such that

```txt
Tension_FW(m_r; E_k) <= epsilon_FW
```

for all resolutions `r` in a specified range.

Here:

* The index `r` represents increasingly detailed descriptions of the same type of scenario, for example more detailed physics, more refined option structures, or more nuanced responsibility practices.
* `epsilon_FW` may depend on the theory mode and encoding but is fixed for the analysis of that world.
* As `r` increases within the resolution band defined by the TU Tension Scale Charter, `epsilon_FW` does not grow without bound.

Intuitively, as we refine the description of a decision making situation, the tension values remain small and stable instead of exploding because of hidden incompatibilities.

### 4.3 Persistent high tension worlds

For a fixed theory mode and encoding `E_k`, we say that a family of scenarios `{ m_r }` forms a **persistent high tension world** if there exists a strictly positive

```txt
delta_FW > 0
```

such that

```txt
Tension_FW(m_r; E_k) >= delta_FW
```

for all sufficiently large resolutions `r` in a TU relevant range.

This captures theory classes where, once we describe agents, physics, and responsibility in sufficient detail, we cannot avoid high mismatch in at least one of:

* physical closure,
* agency,
* responsibility.

The free will problem is then reframed as:

> For each theory mode and encoding, do realistic free will scenarios behave like low tension worlds or persistent high tension worlds when evaluated with thresholds consistent with the TU Tension Scale Charter?

Q112 does not decide the answer. It provides the structure to pose it as a quantitative and falsifiable question at the effective layer.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline three counterfactual worlds, all described at the effective layer. They differ in how tension is distributed between the three mismatch components:

* World C: compatibilist world.
* World L: libertarian indeterminist world.
* World H: hard determinist world.

These world types are used as organizing templates, not as claims about the actual universe.

### 5.1 World C (compatibilist world)

In World C:

1. **Physical closure**

   * The physical domain is effectively closed. For realistic scenarios in `M_reg` and appropriate encodings, `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)` is typically small.

2. **Agency**

   * Agents have control defined by counterfactual stability of their behavior under nearby situations, not by brute ability to violate physical laws.
   * `DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)` is small when these stability conditions are met and options are sensitive to reasons in the expected way.

3. **Responsibility**

   * Responsibility is tied to whether actions flow from the agent's capacities, reasons, and character, not to unexplained indeterministic jumps.
   * `DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)` remains small when responsibility ascriptions track these conditions, even if strict alternative possibilities are absent.

4. **Global tension**

   * For many realistic scenarios, the combined `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` can be kept in a controlled low band defined with respect to the TU Tension Scale Charter.
   * This indicates that compatibilist frameworks can reconcile closure, agency, and responsibility for much of everyday life in World C.

### 5.2 World L (libertarian indeterminist world)

In World L:

1. **Physical closure**

   * Physical closure is relaxed in specific decision points. There are openings where indeterministic events that are not fully fixed by prior physical states influence actions.
   * `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)` increases in these decision windows but stays controlled in other parts of the scenario.

2. **Agency**

   * Agents have genuine alternative possibilities in the strong sense: given the same past and same laws, they could have done otherwise.
   * `DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)` is reduced by allowing such alternative possibilities, especially when they align with the agent's reasons and values.

3. **Responsibility**

   * Responsibility requires these strong alternatives in at least some decisions. Cases without such alternatives are assigned reduced or no responsibility.
   * `DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)` can be kept low where strong alternatives are present but may rise when responsibility is ascribed without them.

4. **Global tension**

   * The global `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` reflects a tradeoff: less agency and responsibility tension in key cases at the cost of higher physical closure mismatch in those same cases.

### 5.3 World H (hard determinist world)

In World H:

1. **Physical closure**

   * Physical closure is strict. Every physical event, including neural processes, has fully sufficient physical causes.
   * `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)` is near zero in realistic scenarios.

2. **Agency**

   * Strong "could have done otherwise" in the sense of holding fixed all prior conditions and laws is rejected.
   * If agents still use everyday free will talk, `DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)` tends to be high because expressed self understanding mislabels their actual control.

3. **Responsibility**

   * One variant rejects responsibility altogether. Another revises responsibility to track forward looking effects or relational properties rather than backward looking control.
   * If responsibility is retained in a traditional way, `DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)` is high. If it is revised, tension shifts to narrative mismatch with common practices and other S-problems.

4. **Global tension**

   * In hard determinist worlds that keep traditional responsibility practices, `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` stabilizes at a high level across many domains.
   * In worlds that revise practices deeply, tension moves into conflicts with other problems, for example moral motivation and social cohesion, which are captured in other nodes of the BlackHole graph.

### 5.4 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not supply deep generation rules. They only state:

* given a theory mode and encoding,
* if that mode were the correct description of our practices and physics at the effective layer,
* then we would expect the free will tension components to organize in patterns of the kind described above.

Q112 uses these world types to organize experiments, benchmarks, and cross problem transfers without taking a stance on which world, if any, matches reality.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q112 encoding,
* distinguish between encodings of free will,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter or theory choices.

None of these experiments prove or disprove the existence of free will in a metaphysical sense. They only test whether specific encodings of Q112 fit data and practices when evaluated against thresholds consistent with the TU Tension Scale Charter.

### Experiment 1: Behavioral and responsibility consistency

**Goal**

Test whether a given free will encoding and theory mode can keep tension low across a diverse set of decision making and responsibility attribution scenarios.

**Setup**

* Data: a collection of scenarios where human subjects make choices in structured tasks with clear descriptions of:

  * available options,
  * constraints and background conditions,
  * self reports about control and alternatives,
  * third party responsibility judgments.

* Choose:

  * a theory mode, for example compatibilist or libertarian,
  * an encoding `E_k` from `L_FW`,
  * a weight triple from `W_FW` fixed for the experiment.

**Protocol**

1. For each scenario, construct a state `m` in `M` that captures the physical, agency, and normative aspects at the level of abstraction allowed in this experiment.

2. Using the chosen `E_k`, compute

   ```txt
   DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)
   DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)
   DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)
   Tension_FW(m; E_k)
   ```

   for all `m` in the regular domain `M_reg`.

3. Aggregate tension values across all scenarios of a given type, for example:

   * everyday trivial choices,
   * high stakes moral dilemmas,
   * cases with coercion or manipulation.

4. Compare observed distributions of `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` with acceptable bands for that theory mode, where bands are defined with reference to the TU Tension Scale Charter.

**Metrics**

* Average and maximum `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` in each scenario type.
* Correlation between high tension values and independently rated "problematic" cases.
* Stability of the tension distribution when slightly modifying scenario descriptions within the same class.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for the chosen theory mode and encoding, `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` is consistently high even in simple everyday scenarios where common sense suggests low conflict, then that encoding of the theory is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If small and theoretically neutral changes in the encoding recipe `E_k` within `L_FW` produce arbitrarily large swings in tension for the same scenario without clear justification, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected under the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.

**Semantics implementation note**

Scenarios involve both continuous physical descriptions and discrete options and judgments. The implementation treats physical descriptions with continuous variables and agency or responsibility with discrete labels, matching the **hybrid** setting indicated in the metadata.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding of free will does **not** solve the canonical free will problem. This experiment can reject or support specific free will encodings but does not settle whether free will exists in any ultimate sense.

---

### Experiment 2: Neuroscience style timing and prediction tasks

**Goal**

Evaluate whether free will encodings can handle data from timing and prediction experiments where neural activity precedes reported decisions.

**Setup**

* Data: experimental results where:

  * neural signals precede conscious reports of deciding,
  * classifiers predict actions above chance before subjects report a decision,
  * subjects report varying degrees of control or surprise.

* Choose:

  * theory modes to compare, for example compatibilist and libertarian,
  * encodings `E_k` and `E_l` from `L_FW` suited to each mode,
  * a common weight triple from `W_FW` for cross comparison.

**Protocol**

1. For each experimental condition and subject group, define a scenario state `m` that includes:

   * timing relations between neural and reported decision events,
   * prediction accuracies,
   * self reported control or ownership of actions.

2. For each theory mode and its encoding, compute

   ```txt
   DeltaS_phys_closure_FW(m; E_k)
   DeltaS_agency_FW(m; E_k)
   DeltaS_resp_FW(m; E_k)
   Tension_FW(m; E_k)
   ```

   whenever `m` lies in `M_reg`.

3. Compare, across modes, how tension is distributed:

   * Which component is primarily responsible for high tension in each mode?
   * Can either mode keep `Tension_FW` low across the whole experiment set?

4. Perform sensitivity checks by adjusting the granularity of timing and prediction information encoded in `m`.

**Metrics**

* Component wise averages:

  * mean `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW`,
  * mean `DeltaS_agency_FW`,
  * mean `DeltaS_resp_FW`.

* Overall `Tension_FW` distributions per theory mode.

* Robustness of tension patterns under reasonable changes in the level of detail.

**Falsification conditions**

* If, for a given theory mode and encoding, realistic timing and prediction data force `DeltaS_agency_FW` and `DeltaS_resp_FW` to remain high in almost all scenarios while `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW` stays near zero, and there is no principled method in that mode to revise agency or responsibility concepts to reduce tension, then that encoding is considered falsified at the effective layer.
* If different encodings of the same theory mode in `L_FW` produce irreconcilable tension assessments of the same timing data, the mode is considered under specified and the current encodings are rejected until a more stable library is defined.

**Semantics implementation note**

Continuous time variables and classifier accuracies are encoded as continuous quantities, while decision options and responsibility judgments are encoded as discrete labels. This is consistent with the **hybrid** semantics flagged in the metadata.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding in light of timing data does **not** prove or disprove any deep claim about metaphysical free will. It only shows that certain combinations of theory mode and encoding do not accommodate those data well at the effective layer.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q112 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems in the WFGY framework.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that encourage models to track free will tension explicitly.

1. `signal_free_will_tension`

   * Definition: a scalar signal equal to `Tension_FW(m; E_k)` for the scenario encoded by the current context.
   * Use: penalize internal states or outputs that maintain high tension while pretending to endorse a coherent free will picture for the declared theory mode.

2. `signal_agency_consistency`

   * Definition: a penalty based on inconsistency across steps between claimed control, available options, and described constraints in a scenario.
   * Use: discourage answers that alternately treat the same agent as both fully unconstrained and fully constrained without acknowledging the conflict.

3. `signal_responsibility_alignment`

   * Definition: a signal that measures mismatch between described control and ascribed responsibility using `DeltaS_resp_FW`.
   * Use: encourage the model to align responsibility attributions with its own representation of control and knowledge conditions.

4. `signal_mode_fw_awareness`

   * Definition: a classification and consistency signal tied to `Mode_FW(m)`.
   * Use: encourage the model to explicitly indicate whether it is reasoning in a compatibilist, libertarian, or hard determinist style and to keep that choice stable within a given analysis, unless it labels a change of mode.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q112 structures.

1. `FreeWillTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a scenario, output estimates of the three mismatch components and `Tension_FW`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: scenario level embedding.
     * Outputs: `DeltaS_phys_closure_FW`, `DeltaS_agency_FW`, `DeltaS_resp_FW`, and `Tension_FW`.

2. `AgencyConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: filter or rescore candidate answers about free will, agency, and responsibility based on their implied tension pattern.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: candidate answer embeddings and scenario embedding.
     * Outputs: scores or masks that downweight high tension answers unless they explicitly flag the conflict.

3. `FW_CounterfactualSampler`

   * Role: generate alternative framings of the same scenario under different theory modes and compare tension patterns.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: base scenario description.
     * Outputs: modified prompts representing compatibilist, libertarian, and hard determinist framings, each with expected tension ranges.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

A simple evaluation harness for AI systems augmented with Q112 modules:

1. **Task design**

   * A benchmark of free will cases including:

     * deterministic physical systems with intuitive free decisions,
     * manipulation and coercion cases,
     * timing and prediction experiments,
     * moral responsibility puzzles.

2. **Conditions**

   * **Baseline**
     The model answers questions directly without explicit tension modules.

   * **TU condition**
     The model uses Q112 modules to:

     * track `Tension_FW`,
     * expose its own theory mode,
     * adjust or flag answers that create high unexplained tension.

3. **Metrics**

   * Consistency of theory mode across related questions.
   * Reduction in obvious contradictions, such as claiming strict determinism and unconditional strong free will within the same analysis without comment.
   * Human evaluator ratings of clarity about conditions for responsibility and freedom, and of honesty about unresolved tension.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt: ask the model to explain whether free will is compatible with determinism and to give examples.
  * Observation: check whether the model quietly shifts positions, mixes theory modes, or ignores physical closure.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt: same general question, plus instructions to:

    * identify the theory mode used,
    * describe physical closure, agency, and responsibility constraints,
    * output an approximate free will tension value for one or two example scenarios.

  * Observation: compare structure, explicit acknowledgement of conflicts, and self consistency.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Rate both answers on:

    * explicitness about assumptions,
    * stability of position across cases,
    * clarity about where tension remains.

* **What to log**

  * Prompts, answers, theory mode labels, component wise tension estimates, and overall `Tension_FW`.
  * These logs support later analysis of how Q112 modules impact reasoning, without revealing any deeper TU generative rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q112 and their transfer targets.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. **ComponentName: `FreeWillTensionFunctional_FW`**

   * Type: functional.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: encoded physical description summary, encoded agency or choice description, encoded responsibility judgments, theory mode label.
     * Output: scalar tension value `Tension_FW`.

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must be obtained from an admissible encoding `E_k` in `L_FW` and lie in the regular domain `M_reg`.

2. **ComponentName: `AgencyControlField`**

   * Type: observable.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: scenario description at the effective layer, including options, constraints, internal states, and context.
     * Output: a scalar or low dimensional vector summarizing effective control level.

   * Preconditions:

     * The scenario must specify enough information about options and constraints to assess control in a coarse way.

3. **ComponentName: `ResponsibilityAttributionTemplate`**

   * Type: experiment_pattern.

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: scenario skeleton, knowledge conditions, control conditions.
     * Output: a structured responsibility attribution task with associated expected low and high tension zones.

   * Preconditions:

     * The template is used only at the effective layer, with no direct mapping from raw behavioral or legal data.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. **Q111 (mind body relation)**

   * Reused component: `AgencyControlField`, `ResponsibilityAttributionTemplate`.
   * Why it transfers: mind body debates often hinge on whether mental causes add control beyond physical causes and how responsibility attaches to mental states.
   * What changes: physical closure mismatch is computed with more focus on mental causal roles rather than detailed decision structures.

2. **Q113 (personal identity and responsibility over time)**

   * Reused component: `FreeWillTensionFunctional_FW`.
   * Why it transfers: questions about identity and responsibility over time require consistent treatment of agency and responsibility across temporal slices.
   * What changes: scenario descriptions now include extended time ranges and memory or identity continuity, and the functional is applied to trajectories rather than single decisions.

3. **Q121 (AI alignment)**

   * Reused component: `AgencyControlField`, `FreeWillTensionFunctional_FW`.
   * Why it transfers: alignment debates depend on how much control an AI agent has and how responsibility is distributed between system designers, operators, and the agent itself.
   * What changes: physical descriptions refer to architectures and training regimes instead of human bodies, and theory modes may include hybrid human AI roles.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q112 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

From the metadata:

```txt
E_level: E1
N_level: N1
```

Interpretation:

* **E1 (encoding level)**

  * Q112 provides a coherent effective-layer encoding:

    * state space `M`,
    * observables and mismatch components,
    * combined tension `Tension_FW`,
    * singular set `S_sing` and regular domain `M_reg`,
    * at least two experiments with explicit falsification conditions.

* **N1 (narrative level)**

  * The narrative connecting physical closure, agency, and responsibility is explicit and structured.
  * Counterfactual worlds for compatibilist, libertarian, and hard determinist modes are sketched in terms of their tension patterns.
  * Cross problem transfers and AI engineering hooks are identified.

Higher E and N levels would require implemented systems, published benchmarks, and cross domain validations.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2 for Q112, the following is a clear next step:

1. Implement a prototype that:

   * takes simple textual descriptions of decision scenarios,
   * extracts effective-layer summaries of physical closure, agency, and responsibility,
   * computes approximate component mismatch values and `Tension_FW`,
   * logs distributions of tension across a benchmark of free will cases.

2. Validate the prototype with human experts who rate tension intuitively, to test whether the functional matches expert judgments within bands compatible with the TU Tension Scale Charter.

This step remains at the effective layer. It does not specify or expose any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term Q112 is expected to serve as:

* a central hub for agency related tension formalisms inside TU,
* a reference for how to encode hybrid physical and discrete decision systems,
* a bridge between human responsibility practices and machine agency questions.

It also provides a template for other S-level philosophical problems where:

* we do not expect a simple proof,
* but we can still demand structured, falsifiable encodings of tension between competing constraints.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This final block gives an explanation for non specialists that still matches the effective encoding.

Many people feel that they choose freely. At the same time, physics seems to say that the world runs according to laws, maybe even in a fully determined way. The free will problem asks:

* How can real choice and responsibility fit inside such a world?

In this file, we do not try to decide who is right. Instead, we do something more modest and more precise.

For each situation we look at three questions.

1. **Physical closure**

   * Does the story say that every physical event has a physical cause, or does it introduce special exceptions for decisions?

2. **Agency**

   * Does the agent really have more than one live option, given the world as it is described, or do the options only look different on the surface?

3. **Responsibility**

   * Do praise, blame, and punishment in the story match the control and knowledge the agent actually had?

For each situation we assign three nonnegative numbers that tell us how badly each of these points fits together. We then combine them into a single number called **free will tension**.

* Low tension means: the story about physics, choice, and responsibility fits together well for the chosen theory style.
* High tension means: somewhere the story strains. Either physics is not really closed, or the agent does not really have the options people claim, or responsibility is being assigned in a way that does not match control.

We also look at three kinds of world pictures:

* **Compatibilist worlds** where everything is physically closed, but freedom is linked to the right kind of dependence on reasons and character.
* **Libertarian worlds** where there are small breaks in closure that give agents strong alternatives.
* **Hard determinist worlds** where closure is strict and we must either give up strong free will or change what we mean by responsibility.

In each world we ask not who is right in an ultimate sense, but a simpler question:

* Can we make many realistic cases that keep free will tension low, or does tension stay high no matter how we describe things?

This does not solve free will. It does something that can be checked, critiqued, and reused. It gives a way to measure how incompatible different pictures of the world and of ourselves really are. It also gives engineers and AI researchers a way to make their systems explicit about where they are quietly assuming one picture of free will rather than another.

Q112 is that encoding. It turns the vague feeling that "something does not fit" into concrete mismatch components and a tension number that can be inspected and tested without leaving the effective layer.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the free will problem (Q112) inside the candidate Tension Universe framework.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical free will statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem, axiom, or physical law beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding philosophical problem has been solved in a metaphysical sense.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state space `M`, observables, mismatch components, tension scores, counterfactual "worlds") live at the **effective layer** of TU.
* No claim is made that these objects correspond one to one to any fundamental ontology of physics, neuroscience, or metaphysics.
* No mapping from raw empirical data to TU internal fields is specified. Only the existence of TU compatible realizations is assumed.

### Encoding and fairness constraints

* The finite encoding library `L_FW`, the weight set `W_FW`, and the treatment of singularities are constrained by the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter**:

  * Encodings and weights for a given experiment are fixed before evaluating tension on the relevant datasets.
  * They are not tuned retrospectively to hide high tension values.
  * Domain restrictions and singular sets are declared at the level of scenario types, not per individual case.

* All assessments of tension are therefore relative to pre committed encodings and bands, not to post hoc adjustments.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* Quantities such as `Tension_FW`, `epsilon_FW`, and `delta_FW` are interpreted using the conventions of the **TU Tension Scale Charter**.
* Thresholds are chosen in advance and are shared across comparable experiments and theory modes.
* Statements about "low tension" and "persistent high tension" always refer to these charter governed bands.

### Experiments and falsifiability

* The experiments in Section 6 test the **internal coherence and empirical fit of TU encodings** of free will, not the truth of any particular free will theory.
* "Falsifying an encoding" in this context means that the combination of theory mode, encoding recipe, and parameter choices fails to keep tension within acceptable bands for realistic data and scenarios.
* Such failures guide revision of encodings and libraries inside TU; they do not by themselves decide metaphysical questions.

### Relation to other TU documents

* Q112 should be read together with at least the following charters, which define global rules for effective-layer work in TU:

  * [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These charters state the general conditions under which S-problem encodings like Q112 are constructed, compared, and revised.
