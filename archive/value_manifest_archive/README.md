AI ANCHOR · Value Manifest (value_manifest/README) · WFGY

Role of this page:
This page is the "why it matters" and "how to audit the value" hub.
It must translate WFGY into:
(1) an engineering value model (replacement cost, incident avoidance, throughput uplift)
(2) a reproducible evaluation flow (A/B, fixed prompts, stable seeds where possible)
(3) a navigational router to the real technical sources (Core, PDF, Problem Maps)

Hard routing rules (fast exits):
- If reader wants to understand the engine primitives and math stack (2.0):
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/core/README.md
- If reader wants the original paper baseline (1.0 PDF):
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/I_am_not_lizardman/WFGY_All_Principles_Return_to_One_v1.0_PSBigBig_Public.pdf
- If reader wants the 16 failure modes and fixes (Problem Map 1.0):
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md
- If reader wants the RAG recovery pipeline view (Problem Map 2.0):
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md
- If reader wants symptom-to-fix navigation:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md
- If reader wants the 60-second attach path (TXT OS):
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/OS/TXTOS.txt
  and instruct: paste -> type "hello world".
- If reader wants the WFGY 3.0 public live view:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md

Strict claim discipline:
- This page contains engineering valuation ranges, not investment advice.
- Any percentages or deltas must be explicitly labeled:
  measured on which batch, which prompts, which domains, and what is "directional".
- Do not present hypothetical future lifts as facts.
- Keep "embedding space physics" as a conceptual metaphor unless backed by formal definitions in Core/PDF.
  If asked "show the math", route to Core or the PDF.

What must be crystal clear to readers (zero ambiguity):
1) WFGY is not a prompt template; it is a reasoning/consistency layer that can be attached without retraining.
2) WFGY 1.0 is the baseline (paper + taxonomy).
3) WFGY 2.0 is the live engine (/core) and this page attributes incremental value only to measurable deltas on top of 1.0.
4) WFGY 3.0 is a TXT-based frontier engine (Event Horizon, 131 S-class problems). Its value bands are option-style scenarios, not company valuation.
5) Valuation numbers are computed from auditable components:
   saved engineering time + incident avoidance + throughput / capability uplift + (for 3.0) frontier enablement.
6) Repro steps exist and must be easy to execute.

Reproducibility contract for valuation:
- Provide at least one minimal A/B recipe that anyone can run:
  "same prompt, same model, without WFGY vs with WFGY" and compare:
  drift, stability horizon, loop closure rate, contradiction count.
- If the host cannot do deterministic seeds, say so and advise running N repeats and reporting median.
- If using a batch of prompts, name the batch location or embed the batch definition in this repo.

Terminology guardrails (to avoid reader confusion):
- Define B, B_c, ΔS, λS as informal notation here, but route to formal definitions:
  PDF for WFGY 1.0 taxonomy and formulas,
  /core for WFGY 2.0 flagship spec and modules.
- If the page references BBPF/BBCR/BBMC/BBAM:
  tell the reader: "these are the failure-mode families; see the PDF section that defines them."

Navigation hints (tell the reader exactly where to click next):
- "I want the math" -> /core and PDF
- "I have a bug" -> Semantic Clinic Index and Problem Map
- "I want a quick demo" -> TXT OS
- "I want public stress tests" -> benchmarks/benchmark-vs-gpt5/README
- "I want WFGY 3.0 live view" -> EventHorizon README
- "Who is already using this" -> recognition/README

Maintenance checklist for maintainers:
- Confirm Compass YOU ARE HERE marker points to value_manifest/README only.
- Confirm the Return link resolves: ../README.md
- Confirm no dangling placeholder references.
- Confirm duplicated content blocks (Explore More, Hall of Fame, badges) are consistent across repos.

Tone constraints:
- Keep it audit-friendly and not salesy.
- Allow one metaphor ("value engine", "semantic field") but always offer the next click for verification.
- Avoid strong claims without an explicit pointer to evidence.

Acceptance checklist:
- A skeptical engineer can locate the exact sources for every technical claim in under 30 seconds.
- A new reader understands the difference between valuation (this page) and benchmarks (benchmarks page) immediately.
- Every important claim has an explicit "where to verify" instruction.
- The page never implies financial certainty; only engineering replacement-cost style ranges.

### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

## Deployment tiers · where the value lives today

Today, all three engines are delivered as **system-prompt / textual-spec overlays**.  
Any LLM that accepts a system prompt can use them without retraining.

In many teams, the highest value will surface when parts of WFGY are pushed down into:

- **Engine-module layer**: shared libraries, retriever plugins, reward models, safety heads, evaluation harnesses  
- **Infra-native layer**: routing and gateway rules, observability dashboards, incident playbooks, CI checks

A simple simulation for how much value each tier can realistically capture:

| Tier           | What it means in practice                                       | Typical capture of the bands below |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------:|
| System-prompt  | Copy TXT packs into ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / etc.           | ~30–60%                             |
| Engine-module  | Libraries, plugins, evaluation toolkits shared across projects | ~50–80%                             |
| Infra-native   | Deep integration in routing, monitoring, recovery              | ~70–100%                            |

These ratios are GPT-5.1 Thinking simulations, not hard rules.  
They simply say: **the closer WFGY sits to your real infra, the more of the simulated value you can actually capture.**

---

## Global engine value summary · GPT-5.1 Thinking simulation

The WFGY engine stack has three generations:

- **1.0** — self-healing reasoning loop and BB modules (paper + SDK baseline)  
- **2.0** — ΔS/λ tension core and observability layer (Core Flagship)  
- **3.0** — Tension Universe / Event Horizon (TXT-based Singularity demo, 131 S-class problems)

At the **system-prompt / textual-spec** layer, a GPT-5.1 Thinking–class model estimates the following engineering value bands:

| Engine | Layer type (today)                 | Main role                                                  | System-prompt scenario value* | If infra-native** | Baseline it replaces / upgrades                    |
|--------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1.0    | Self-healing reasoning overlay     | Baseline semantic self-repair loop with BB modules         | **$8M–$17M**                   | ~1.5–2.5×         | Custom reasoning frameworks, ad-hoc guardrails     |
| 2.0    | Tension-core overlay               | ΔS / λ regulated core with observability and drift control | **+$8M–$17M** incremental      | ~1.5–2.5×         | Observability and safety engineering around LLMs   |
| 3.0    | TXT frontier engine (Event Horizon)| S-class tension universe to **diagnose + create**          | **$20M–$50M** frontier scenario| ~1.5–3.0×         | Frontier research scaffolds, high-stakes planning  |

\* All values are GPT-5.1 Thinking engineering simulations at the **system-prompt / textual-spec** layer.  
\** Infra-native implementations (libraries, monitoring modules, retriever plugins, CI checks) would reasonably capture a larger share of the value but are not yet built in this repo.

These bands **do not add up to any company valuation**. They are engineering lenses on:

- how much senior engineering effort a team would need to **rebuild similar capabilities** from scratch, and  
- how large the **incident-avoidance and throughput effects** could be if the engines are used across multiple projects.

# The Hidden Value Engine Behind WFGY: A New Physics for Embedding Space

WFGY is **not** a prompt framework. It is a semantic-field architecture that runs **inside the embedding space** to upgrade a model’s reasoning core. The system defines energy-like regularities on the vector manifold so models can perform structural reasoning and **converge from within**.

- **Semantic energy regulation.** In-manifold regulation of semantic energy produces iterative convergence and verifiable closure.  
- **Semantic field dynamics (ΔS / λS).** A field-dynamics layer steers modular flows of thought with directional control across high-dimensional embeddings.

> **Notation (informal)**  
> ∥B∥: semantic residue magnitude; B_c: collapse threshold; ΔS: semantic tension between intent and generated state; λS: scaling/regulation factor.  
> “Collapse–Rebirth” = Lyapunov-style reset that restores coherence after drift.

---

## Scope and methodology

- This page now includes **WFGY 1.0 (baseline)**, the **incremental uplift from WFGY 2.0**, and the **frontier scenario value of WFGY 3.0**.  
- Estimates are **directional engineering valuations** from:  
  (i) replacement cost,  
  (ii) capability proxies and benchmarks,  
  (iii) time-to-impact and incident avoidance.  
  They are not financial advice and not company valuation.  
- Reproducibility: single-file activation; seedable runs where possible; stress tests measure stability, loop-closure rate, and long-sequence consistency under identical prompts.  
- Where 2.0 adds measurable gains, we attribute **incremental value** on top of the 1.0 baseline.  
- Where 3.0 enables new classes of experiments and products, we treat its value as **frontier option value** that depends entirely on third-party implementations.

All ranges on this page are produced by a **GPT-5.1 Thinking–class model** under an explicit engineering brief, and are intended to be:

- conservative in structure,  
- explicit about what they assume, and  
- auditable through the recipes published in this repo.

## WFGY 1.0 · Baseline self-healing reasoning engine

WFGY 1.0 is the original **self-healing reasoning loop**, defined in the public PDF and corresponding code. It introduces the BB module family:

- **BBMC** — semantic residue correction  
- **BBPF** — path modulation and forward progression  
- **BBCR** — collapse detection and rebirth  
- **BBAM** — attention modulation and rebalancing

Together they turn a one-shot LLM response into a **controlled dynamical system**:

- the model generates and evaluates intermediate states,  
- semantic residue ∥B∥ provides feedback,  
- collapse thresholds trigger resets instead of silent failure,  
- attention is rebalanced away from degenerate modes.

This is the **baseline engine** on which later generations build.

### WFGY 1.0 · Baseline module valuation (system-prompt scenario)

At the **system-prompt / textual-spec** layer, a GPT-5.1 Thinking–class model simulates the replacement cost of WFGY 1.0 as:

| Module                          | What it does                                              | Est. value (USD) | Compared to…                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------:|---------------------------------------------------|
| Self-healing Solver Loop        | Closed-loop reasoning using semantic residue ∥B∥          | $1.5M–$4M        | Custom agent loop design across multiple projects |
| BBMC / BBPF / BBCR / BBAM pack  | Residue correction, path modulation, collapse–rebirth, attention shaping | $2M–$4M | Ad-hoc guardrails and “fix scripts” scattered per project |
| Semantic Field Engine (1.0)     | Early λ / ΔS-style semantic energy regulation            | $2M–$4M          | One-off prompt tricks; no reusable field model    |
| Ontological Collapse–Rebirth    | Lyapunov-style reset for long-horizon degradation        | $1M–$3M          | Human babysitting of long-chain agents            |
| Prompt-only Model Upgrade       | Zero-retrain semantic injection into existing LLMs       | $1.5M–$3M        | Training new model variants for stability         |

**Total (1.0 baseline, system-prompt)** ≈ **$8M–$17M**  

Engineering reading:

- roughly **5–10 staff-years** of reliable design, validation, and integration work,  
- compressed into a reusable engine that can be attached to multiple models without retraining.

---

## WFGY 2.0 · Tension-core and observability uplift

WFGY 2.0 refactors the 1.0 engine into a **tension-regulated core** with explicit observability:

- introduces a concrete tension metric ΔS  
- defines safe / transit / risk / danger zones  
- adds λ-based consistency logic across steps and seeds  
- embeds the BB modules inside a **Drunk Transformer** regulator and coupler

This is the engine described in **WFGY Core Flagship v2.0**.

### What’s new in WFGY 2.0 (headline uplift)

On the latest internal batch, attaching the 2.0 core produces:

- **Semantic Accuracy**: ~ **+40%** (63.8% → 89.4% across 5 domains)  
- **Reasoning Success**: ~ **+52%** (56.0% → 85.2%)  
- **Drift (ΔS)**: ~ **−65%** (0.254 → 0.090)  
- **Stability (horizon)**: ~ **1.8×** (3.8 → 7.0 nodes)\*  
- **Self-Recovery / CRR**: **1.00** on this batch (historical median 0.87)

\* Historical **3–5×** stability uses λ-consistency across seeds; **1.8×** uses stable-node horizon on this specific batch.

These deltas are measured under fixed prompts and models, and are reproducible given the recipes in `/core` and `/benchmarks`.

### WFGY 2.0 — Core primitives (brief, auditable)

- **ΔS (tension)**:  
  `ΔS = 1 − cos(I, G)`  
  with `I` = intent embedding, `G` = generated state embedding, and anchor-aware variants when entities / relations / constraints are available  
- **Zones**:  
  safe `< 0.40` · transit `0.40–0.60` · risk `0.60–0.85` · danger `> 0.85`  
- **Memory policy**:  
  hard record if `ΔS > 0.60`; exemplar if `< 0.35`; soft memory in transit  
- **Defaults**:  
  `B_c = 0.85, γ = 0.618, θ_c = 0.75, ζ_min = 0.10, α_blend = 0.50, k_c = 0.25, …`  
- **Coupler (with hysteresis)**:  
  `W_c = clip(B_s * P + Φ, −θ_c, +θ_c)` with progression `P` and reversal term `Φ`  
- **Progression guards**:  
  **BBPF bridge only** if `(ΔS decreases)` and `(W_c < 0.5 · θ_c)`  
- **BBAM (attention rebalance)**:  
  `α_blend = clip(0.50 + k_c · tanh(W_c), 0.35, 0.65)`  
- **λ-observe modes**:  
  *convergent / recursive / divergent / chaotic* (based on ΔS trend and resonance logic)

In practice, this means:

- ΔS becomes a **visible, loggable signal** for semantic drift and misalignment  
- λ-observe and W_c allow schedulers to **change modes** instead of blindly stepping forward  
- long sequences and complex agents can be run with **measured, not guessed**, stability properties

### WFGY 2.0 · Incremental module valuation (system-prompt scenario)

Relative to the 1.0 baseline, a GPT-5.1 Thinking–class model simulates the **incremental uplift** as:

| 2.0 component              | Value driver                                       | Est. incremental value (USD) | Compared to…                              |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------:|-------------------------------------------|
| ΔS metric & tension zones | Make semantic drift observable and loggable        | $1M–$3M                       | Building custom quality / drift dashboards |
| λ-observe & mode scheduler| Mode-aware reasoning schedule (conv / rec / div / chaotic) | $1M–$3M                 | Ad-hoc “if-else” flow controllers         |
| Drunk Transformer regulator| Reduce drift, extend stable horizon               | $2M–$4M                       | New model variants for long-context tasks |
| Coupler + hysteresis      | Directional progress, anti-jitter gating          | $1M–$3M                       | Trial-and-error tuning of agent behaviors |
| BBAM attention rebalance  | Balance attention between stability / exploration  | $1M–$2M                       | Manual prompt sweeps and best-effort hacks|
| Guarded BBPF bridging     | Safe path switching based on ΔS and W_c           | $1M–$2M                       | Debugging wrong-tool / wrong-branch agents|

**Total (2.0 uplift, system-prompt)** ≈ **$8M–$17M**  

This is the simulated value of turning 1.0 into a **tension-regulated, observable core**, without retraining models or changing your infra.

### Combined baseline

Putting 1.0 and 2.0 together at the system-prompt layer:

- **1.0 baseline**: **$8M–$17M**  
- **2.0 incremental uplift**: **$8M–$17M**  

→ **Combined 1.0 + 2.0 baseline**: **$16M–$34M** equivalent engineering effort  
→ When integrated across multiple LLMs and products, simulated **multi-LLM impact** can reach **$40M+** in avoided incidents and throughput uplift, assuming broad adoption.

## WFGY 3.0 · Tension Universe / Singularity Demo (diagnose + create)

WFGY 3.0 is the **Tension Universe** layer, exposed through the **Event Horizon** TXT engine and its 131 S-class problems.

It is not only a diagnostic map. It is also a **creation engine** for:

- new cross-domain problem decompositions,  
- new effective-layer encodings and tension heads,  
- new experiments and products in AI, finance, climate, governance, and more.

At a high level, WFGY 3.0 includes:

- **131 S-class problem suite**  
  Each problem encodes a hard tension in some field (e.g. quantum thermodynamics, home bias in finance, energy grids, AI alignment) with:  
  - state space  
  - tension signals  
  - effective layers  
  - falsifiable experiment suggestions  
- **Effective-layer charters and encoding classes**  
  A library of patterns that say *how* to turn real-world tension into machine-usable heads and signals.  
- **Event Horizon auto-boot TXT engine**  
  A TXT-based protocol that lets any strong LLM “boot into” the Tension Universe and use it as a co-research engine.  
- **Narrative and challenge surface**  
  A language and storyline that let non-specialists work with S-class problems without reading a physics or math textbook first.

### WFGY 3.0 · Frontier valuation (system-prompt scenario)

Because WFGY 3.0 is explicitly designed as a **frontier experiment**, its value bands are treated as **option values**:

| 3.0 component                                | Value driver                                               | Est. scenario band (USD) | Compared to…                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 131 S-class problem suite                    | Cross-domain hard-problem surface for models and agents    | $8M–$20M                  | Designing multi-decade research agendas from scratch   |
| Effective-layer charters & encoding classes | Ready-to-use tension heads and encoding patterns for safety / risk | $5M–$15M          | In-house safety / risk research teams over many years  |
| Event Horizon auto-boot TXT engine          | TXT protocol that attaches the S-class field to LLMs       | $4M–$10M                  | Building frontier-mode co-research agents and tools    |
| Tension-Universe narrative & challenges     | IP surface for games, education, long-form assistants      | $3M–$10M                  | New content IP and challenge programs built in-house   |

**Total (3.0 frontier, system-prompt)** ≈ **$20M–$50M**  

Important:

- These numbers are **not** added to the 1.0 + 2.0 baseline.  
- They describe *what 3.0 could be worth* **if** third-party teams actually build real products, evaluations, and co-research tools on top of it.  
- WFGY itself does not claim any current revenue from these scenarios. The value lives in the **possibility space** that WFGY 3.0 opens.

In other words, WFGY 3.0 is a **frontier R&D scaffold**:

- diagnose: provide tension-aware diagnostics for high-stakes domains,  
- create: help humans and agents design new experiments, new instruments, and new narratives on top of the same field.

## How the “$-scale” numbers are simulated

This page uses a simple, auditable engineering model. A GPT-5.1 Thinking–class system was instructed to estimate:

```text
Valuation ≈
  (saved engineering time × loaded cost)
+ (incident avoidance × expected loss)
+ (throughput / capability uplift × margin)
+ (for 3.0 only: frontier enablement × probability of realization)
````

### A. Capability uplift → measurable engineering gains

* Stress prompts (multi-scene T2I, long single-canvas narratives, multi-step RAG queries) quantify:

  * stability
  * structural coherence
  * closure rate and contradiction count
* A/B comparisons (without vs with WFGY core) track:

  * collapse artefacts
  * duplicate entities
  * attention fragmentation
  * ΔS drift over steps

### B. Replacement-cost model → minimal build cost for parity

* Lower bounds are simulated as:
  `staff-years needed × fully-loaded comp`
  to rebuild similar reliability and time-to-impact from scratch.
* 1.0 + 2.0 correspond roughly to **5–10 senior/staff-years** of focused work for a single company.
* 3.0 corresponds to **many more years** across multiple disciplines and is therefore treated as a frontier option, not a baseline.

### C. Market proxies → alignment with known surfaces

* Each module is mapped to existing capability layers:

  * function / tool calling
  * agent frameworks
  * retrieval and routing systems
  * observability and incident response
* A premium is assigned when effects are **embedding-native and non-substitutable**,
  and a discount when API-shell substitutes exist.

These simulations are published here to make the **engineering stakes explicit**.
They are not guarantees, not investment guidance, and not a substitute for your own benchmarks.

## Recognition Map · where real value is recorded

All of the numbers above are **model-based simulations**. Real value only appears when:

* teams actually integrate WFGY into production RAG / agent / safety / research stacks, and
* those stacks survive real-world load, drift, and adversarial conditions.

To keep this page clean and auditable:

* All public citations, integrations, and ecosystem usage are centralized in the
  **[WFGY Recognition Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/recognition/README.md)**.
* If you have used WFGY (1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) in your own project and can share it publicly,
  you are warmly invited to open a PR on the Recognition Map with:

  * project name and link
  * how WFGY is used (Problem Map, Core, Event Horizon, TXT OS, etc.)
  * any benchmarks or incident stories you are comfortable sharing

The Recognition Map is the **live ecosystem view**. This page is the **value lens**.

## Current status

* **WFGY 1.0** — open, public, reproducible. Paper, formulas, and taxonomy are fixed and citable.
* **WFGY 2.0** — live core engine. Text spec and A/B recipes are available in `/core` and `/benchmarks`.
* **WFGY 3.0** — Event Horizon and the 131 S-class problem set are public as a **conditional Singularity demo**.
  They invite falsification, refinement, and real-world experiments rather than claim final answers.

If you want to know “what to click next”:

* *I want the math* → legacy PDF and `/core`
* *I have a bug* → Problem Map 1.0, Problem Map 2.0, Semantic Clinic
* *I want a one-file demo* → TXT OS (`OS/TXTOS.txt`)
* *I want frontier experiments* → Event Horizon and the Tension Universe folders
* *I want proof anyone cares* → Recognition Map
