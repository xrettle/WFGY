## 0. Effective-layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe program.

* We only define encodings, observables, mismatch functionals, counterfactual worlds, and experiments that sit on top of existing cosmological modelling practice.
* We do not propose or select any deep Tension Universe axiom system or generating rules, and we do not claim to derive standard cosmology from such rules.
* We do not prove or disprove the canonical dark energy problem in any logical sense. We only describe how a specific family of effective encodings can be stress tested and possibly falsified.
* Whenever this page speaks about “worlds” or “universes”, it refers to effective descriptions that can be replaced or upgraded in future Tension Universe versions without changing the canonical problem in Section 1.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical problem behind Q042 can be phrased as follows.

Observations of distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and large scale structure indicate that:

* the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating
* the total energy budget is dominated by a component with negative effective pressure

In the standard cosmological modelling framework, this is usually described by:

* a homogeneous and isotropic background metric
* a Friedmann style equation relating the expansion rate to energy densities
* an effective dark energy component with density `rho_DE` and equation of state parameter `w_DE = p_DE / rho_DE` at the background level

The core question is:

> Is there an effective dark energy sector, within a reasonable class of models, that can consistently account for all major cosmic acceleration probes at once, with acceptable tension across channels and scales?

More concretely, we consider:

* background expansion observables (distances, Hubble parameter as a function of redshift)
* structure growth observables (for example growth rate and clustering amplitude)
* the global energy budget (densities of matter, radiation, curvature, and dark energy)
* multi channel constraints (supernovae, BAO, CMB, large scale structure)

The canonical problem is to decide whether there exists a dark energy description, from an admissible class, for which these observables can be made jointly consistent without persistent high tension, or whether any such description must remain in a permanently strained configuration.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Empirically, the existence of cosmic acceleration is well supported. A cosmological constant like dark energy component with `w_DE` close to `-1` fits a broad range of data within current uncertainties. However:

* independent probes sometimes prefer slightly different parameter values
* some data combinations show mild but repeated tension indications
* there is no universally accepted fundamental explanation for the dark energy sector

Theoretical challenges include:

* explaining the tiny but nonzero effective vacuum energy scale
* understanding whether dark energy is a cosmological constant, a dynamical field, a sign of modified gravity, or a sign of more radical changes
* relating late time acceleration to early universe physics and high energy theories

From the BlackHole viewpoint, Q042 is an open S level problem:

* there is no agreed complete resolution of the origin and nature of dark energy
* there is no settled answer on whether a single simple dark energy description can remove all cross channel tensions once data reach higher precision

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q042 plays several roles.

* It is the primary node for hidden dark energy sector questions, complementing dark matter (Q041) and H0 tension (Q048).
* It establishes a template for multi channel cosmological consistency_tension where a hidden energy component is inferred rather than directly observed.
* It defines reusable components:

  * a dark energy state space with effective summaries of expansion, growth, and energy budgets
  * a combined dark energy tension functional `Tension_DE`
  * counterfactual cosmic acceleration worlds with and without explicit dark energy

These components can be transferred to other cosmological and non cosmological problems that share “budget plus multi channel evidence” structure.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q042 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125, using explicit relationships to components and tension types.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is strictly at the effective layer. We describe only:

* state spaces
* effective fields and observables
* mismatch quantities and tension scores
* singular sets and domain restrictions

We do not describe any deep Tension Universe generative rules, and we do not describe any explicit mapping from raw observational data to internal Tension Universe fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a dark energy state space

```txt
M_DE
```

with this effective interpretation.

* Each `m` in `M_DE` is a coherent “dark energy cosmology configuration” over a finite redshift and scale range.
* A state `m` encodes:

  * background expansion history summaries, represented by values of an effective expansion rate in redshift bins
  * energy density parameters for matter, radiation, curvature, and dark energy
  * an effective dark energy equation of state parameterisation
  * growth of structure summaries over specified ranges
  * channel level summaries for supernovae, BAO, CMB, and large scale structure
  * meta information about resolution level and credible uncertainty ranges

We do not specify how such states are constructed from raw data. We only assume that:

* for any reasonable combination of observational data sets and model choices, there exist states `m` in `M_DE` that encode consistent summaries at a declared resolution.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following effective observables on `M_DE`.

1. Background expansion observable

```txt
H_eff(m; z_bin)
```

* Input: state `m`, redshift bin label `z_bin`.
* Output: an effective scalar summarising the expansion rate in that bin.

2. Energy density parameters

```txt
Omega_m(m)
Omega_DE(m)
Omega_r(m)
Omega_k(m)
```

* Interpretation: effective density parameters for matter, dark energy, radiation, and curvature, assumed finite for `m` in the regular domain.

3. Dark energy equation of state parameters

```txt
w_DE(m; a_bin)
```

* Input: state `m`, scale factor bin label `a_bin`.
* Output: an effective value of the dark energy equation of state in that bin, according to a fixed parameterisation family.

4. Growth of structure summaries

```txt
G_growth(m; k_bin, z_bin)
```

* Input: state `m`, wavenumber bin label `k_bin`, redshift bin label `z_bin`.
* Output: a scalar summarising growth or clustering amplitude for that bin.

5. Evidence channel summaries

```txt
obs_SN(m)
obs_BAO(m)
obs_CMB(m)
obs_LSS(m)
```

* Each is a finite descriptor of how well the state `m` matches supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, or large scale structure data within the adopted model.

### 3.3 Mismatch observables and combined tension

We define non negative mismatch observables.

1. Background expansion mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_background(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the deviation of `H_eff(m; z_bin)` and derived distance integrals from a reference background profile consistent with a benchmark dark energy model.

2. Growth mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_growth(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the deviation of `G_growth(m; k_bin, z_bin)` from growth predictions of the same benchmark model.

3. Energy budget mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_budget(m) >= 0
```

* Measures how much the set `{Omega_m(m), Omega_DE(m), Omega_r(m), Omega_k(m)}` deviates from allowed ranges and from global constraints like approximate closure of the density budget.

We combine these into a dark energy tension functional

```txt
Tension_DE(m) =
  w_back   * DeltaS_background(m) +
  w_growth * DeltaS_growth(m) +
  w_budget * DeltaS_budget(m)
```

with fixed weights satisfying

```txt
w_back   > 0
w_growth > 0
w_budget > 0
w_back + w_growth + w_budget = 1
```

The weights are part of the encoding choice and must be fixed before evaluating `Tension_DE(m)` on any data set.

The semantics label `continuous` in the metadata indicates that all these mismatch functionals are treated as continuous functions of the underlying summary vectors at the chosen bin resolution, rather than as discrete category switches.

### 3.4 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

We specify an admissible class of encodings at the effective layer.

1. Model library

We fix a finite library of dark energy model families, such as:

* cosmological constant models with `w_DE = -1`
* slowly varying scalar field like models with `w_DE` in a bounded interval near `-1`
* parameterised models with `w_DE(a)` described by a small number of parameters within declared bounds
* effective models that map a restricted class of modified gravity theories into an equivalent dark energy sector description

The library is fixed before analysis and is not adjusted in response to specific data sets.

2. Reference profiles

For each model family in the library, we predeclare a small set of benchmark parameter choices that define reference profiles for background expansion and growth.

* Reference background profile:

  ```txt
  H_ref(model_family, parameter_choice; z_bin)
  ```

* Reference growth profile:

  ```txt
  G_ref(model_family, parameter_choice; k_bin, z_bin)
  ```

The mismatch observables `DeltaS_background` and `DeltaS_growth` for a state `m` are defined by comparing its encoded quantities to these reference profiles, using norms that are specified once and reused consistently.

The reference profiles are chosen without using the same data sets that will later be used to evaluate `Tension_DE`.

3. Fairness constraints

To prevent parameter tuning from hiding tension:

* weights `(w_back, w_growth, w_budget)` must be fixed before any evaluation on a given data set
* the norm choices used in `DeltaS_background`, `DeltaS_growth`, and `DeltaS_budget` must be specified once per study and cannot be changed after seeing the resulting tension distributions
* the benchmark parameter choices used in reference profiles cannot be adjusted in response to tension outcomes on the same data sets

These constraints ensure that `Tension_DE` is not retrofitted to make any given world look artificially low tension. In particular, any change to the model library, reference profiles, norms, or weights after inspecting `Tension_DE` outputs is treated as a new encoding that must be logged as a separate version.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may have incomplete or inconsistent descriptors. To handle this, we define a singular set

```txt
S_sing_DE = { m in M_DE :
              any core observable is undefined or not finite,
              or basic consistency constraints fail }
```

Examples of conditions that place a state in `S_sing_DE` include:

* `Omega_m(m) < 0` or `Omega_DE(m) < 0`
* the sum of density parameters differs from unity by more than a declared tolerance without a clear curvature or model explanation
* `H_eff(m; z_bin)` is not defined for some required `z_bin`
* growth descriptors are missing in ranges where they are required for tension evaluation

We define the regular domain

```txt
M_DE_reg = M_DE \ S_sing_DE
```

All mismatch observables and `Tension_DE(m)` are defined only on `M_DE_reg`. When an experiment attempts to evaluate `Tension_DE(m)` for `m` in `S_sing_DE`, the outcome is classified as “out of domain” and not taken as evidence for or against any dark energy scenario.

### 3.6 Effective tension tensor

For bookkeeping inside the Tension Universe program, we group the local sensitivities of `Tension_DE` with respect to background, growth, and budget directions into a symbolic dark energy tension tensor

```txt
T_ij_DE(m)
```

* The indices `i` and `j` label coarse directions in the combined space of expansion, growth, and budget descriptors.
* Entries of `T_ij_DE(m)` are understood as second order responses of `Tension_DE` to small, internally consistent perturbations of those descriptors at fixed admissible encoding.
* `T_ij_DE(m)` is used only as an internal diagnostic object when comparing different encodings or experiments at the effective layer. It is not a physical stress energy tensor and it does not introduce any new field beyond the observables already listed.

We do not specify any explicit formula for `T_ij_DE(m)` in this document. Any such formula belongs to a deeper Tension Universe implementation layer and can be changed without altering the claims made here about Q042.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q042 is characterised as a tension problem in the Tension Universe framework, at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension principle

The core tension principle for Q042 is:

> Treat cosmic acceleration and dark energy as a multi channel consistency problem. A successful dark energy description from the admissible class should admit a sequence of regular states that keep `Tension_DE` inside a low, stable band as resolution and data quality improve, while a fundamentally wrong description will require persistent high tension.

We formalise this using a refinement index `k` that labels increasing resolution or data quality.

For each `k` we consider:

* a fixed set of observational inputs for that resolution
* a state `m_k` in `M_DE_reg` that encodes summaries of those inputs under a chosen dark energy model from the admissible library

This principle is an effective layer rule. It does not assert that any particular dark energy model is the true microphysical description of the universe.

### 4.2 Low tension dark energy worlds

In a low tension dark energy world, there exists at least one admissible encoding, and at least one sequence of states `(m_k)` in `M_DE_reg`, such that:

```txt
Tension_DE(m_k) <= epsilon_DE
```

for all sufficiently large `k`, where:

* `epsilon_DE` is a small positive constant determined by acceptable levels of residual mismatch and uncertainty
* `epsilon_DE` does not grow with `k`

Intuitively, as we add more precise or more numerous observations, it remains possible to represent the universe with states whose background, growth, and budget mismatches stay within an acceptable band. Some fluctuation of tension at intermediate resolutions is allowed, as long as there is no trend toward unavoidable high tension.

### 4.3 Persistent high tension worlds

In a persistent high tension world, for every admissible encoding and for every sequence `(m_k)` in `M_DE_reg` that remains faithful to the data, there exists a strictly positive `delta_DE` such that:

```txt
Tension_DE(m_k) >= delta_DE
```

for all sufficiently large `k`, with `delta_DE` not tending to zero as `k` increases.

In such a world, no matter how one chooses models and reference profiles within the admissible class, and no matter how carefully one builds states from data, dark energy remains in a permanently strained configuration when confronted with the totality of observations.

Q042 frames the canonical problem as the task of determining whether our universe behaves more like a low tension dark energy world or a persistent high tension world, without claiming to solve that problem.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe three counterfactual worlds, strictly at the effective layer, in terms of patterns of observables and tension behaviour.

### 5.1 World Lambda (cosmological constant like dark energy)

In World Lambda:

1. The dark energy sector is well described by a cosmological constant, meaning `w_DE` is effectively `-1` across the observationally probed range.

2. For suitable states `m_Lambda,k` in `M_DE_reg`, representing the universe at increasing resolutions:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_background(m_Lambda,k)
   DeltaS_growth(m_Lambda,k)
   DeltaS_budget(m_Lambda,k)
   ```

   all stay within small, bounded ranges that match current Lambda based analyses.

3. The combined tension `Tension_DE(m_Lambda,k)` remains below a modest threshold `epsilon_DE_Lambda` that does not grow with `k`.

4. Channel specific summaries `obs_SN`, `obs_BAO`, `obs_CMB`, and `obs_LSS` show no systematic pattern of mutually incompatible demands on the dark energy sector beyond expected statistical fluctuations.

World Lambda represents the idealised low tension case for standard dark energy.

### 5.2 World w_dyn (dynamical dark energy within admissible class)

In World w_dyn:

1. The dark energy sector is described by a time varying equation of state `w_DE(a)` within the admissible parameterisation class.

2. Some combinations of data are better fit by states with modest deviation of `w_DE` from `-1`, such as slightly evolving behaviour, while still maintaining acceptable fits to the overall expansion and growth data.

3. For states `m_dyn,k` in `M_DE_reg`, the mismatch observables:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_background(m_dyn,k)
   DeltaS_growth(m_dyn,k)
   DeltaS_budget(m_dyn,k)
   ```

   can be reduced compared to World Lambda in some data sets, but they may also require more intricate compensation among channels.

4. As resolution increases, there exists at least one sequence `(m_dyn,k)` for which `Tension_DE(m_dyn,k)` remains below a chosen `epsilon_DE_dyn`, possibly slightly larger than the Lambda benchmark, but still bounded and reasonably stable.

World w_dyn describes a situation where additional dark energy freedom genuinely absorbs some tensions while maintaining coherence.

### 5.3 World noDE (no effective dark energy sector)

In World noDE:

1. The cosmic acceleration is attributed entirely to modified gravity or other effects that do not admit a clean effective dark energy sector within the admissible class.

2. Attempts to represent the universe by states `m_noDE,k` in `M_DE_reg` with negligible `Omega_DE` are forced to satisfy the observational constraints using only `Omega_m`, `Omega_r`, `Omega_k`, and effective changes in gravity.

3. For all such states, at sufficiently high resolution, at least one of the mismatch observables must become large:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_background(m_noDE,k)
   DeltaS_growth(m_noDE,k)
   DeltaS_budget(m_noDE,k)
   ```

4. As a result, `Tension_DE(m_noDE,k)` stays above a threshold `delta_DE_noDE > 0` that cannot be eliminated by re parameterising within the admissible dark energy encoding class.

World noDE functions as a reference for high tension scenarios relative to the chosen dark energy description, while acknowledging that a more general modified gravity framework might require its own separate encoding.

### 5.4 Interpretive note

These worlds do not claim to explicitly construct internal Tension Universe fields from data, nor to decide which world is physically realised. They instead describe the qualitative behaviour of mismatch observables and `Tension_DE` in representative classes of scenarios that are distinguishable at the effective layer.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can test the quality of the Q042 encoding and discriminate between tension patterns in different worlds. Each experiment operates at the effective layer and cannot by itself prove or disprove the canonical dark energy problem. It can only falsify or support specific encodings.

Throughout this block, all experiments are assumed to respect the admissible class and fairness constraints in Section 3.4. Any change to those constraints is treated as a new encoding.

### Experiment 1: Joint real data dark energy tension map

*Goal:*

Test whether the defined `Tension_DE` functional, together with the admissible encoding class, can produce low and stable tension values for real cosmological data sets under at least one dark energy model family.

*Setup:*

* Data:

  * supernova distance measurements across a range of redshifts
  * baryon acoustic oscillation measurements
  * cosmic microwave background summaries relevant to late time expansion
  * large scale structure growth measurements, such as growth rate and clustering amplitude

* Model library:

  * a fixed finite set of dark energy model families and benchmark parameterisations as defined in the admissible encoding class

* Encoding parameters:

  * fixed weights `(w_back, w_growth, w_budget)` satisfying the constraints in Block 3
  * fixed norms for computing `DeltaS_background`, `DeltaS_growth`, and `DeltaS_budget`
  * declared tolerance levels for energy budget closure and basic consistency checks
  * all these choices are made before inspecting any `Tension_DE` distribution on the target data

*Protocol:*

1. For each model family and each benchmark parameter choice in the admissible library, construct a state `m_data,model` in `M_DE_reg` that encodes:

   * background expansion summaries from the combined data
   * growth summaries from large scale structure data
   * density parameters and channel summaries

   The construction procedure is not described within the Tension Universe framework; only its existence and coherence are assumed.

2. Compute the mismatch observables `DeltaS_background(m_data,model)`, `DeltaS_growth(m_data,model)`, and `DeltaS_budget(m_data,model)` for each state.

3. Evaluate `Tension_DE(m_data,model)` using the fixed weights.

4. Repeat the evaluation for a sequence of refinement levels `k`, where each `k` corresponds to including more precise data, more channels, or finer binning.

5. Record, for each `k`, the minimal observed tension

   ```txt
   T_min(k) = min over model choices of Tension_DE(m_data,model)
   ```

   and the distribution of tension values.

*Metrics:*

* the behaviour of `T_min(k)` as a function of `k`
* the spread of `Tension_DE` across different model families at each `k`
* the stability of low tension regions in parameter space when moving from `k` to `k+1`

*Falsification conditions:*

The Q042 encoding (including the choice of model library, reference profiles, and weight configuration) is considered falsified at the effective layer if both conditions hold:

1. For sufficiently large `k`, `T_min(k)` exceeds a predetermined threshold `epsilon_DE_max` that represents the maximum acceptable low tension band for dark energy models.
2. The trend of `T_min(k)` with `k` does not show any approach toward a stable low tension region, but instead remains high or increases as more data and resolution are added.

If these conditions hold, then no admissible dark energy encoding in the fixed library can be regarded as providing a low tension explanation of the observed cosmic acceleration under the present `Tension_DE` framework.

*Semantics implementation note:*

This experiment is carried out in a continuous field sense consistent with the metadata declaration, in which `H_eff`, density parameters, and growth summaries are treated as continuous valued variables over binned ranges.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying a Tension Universe encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment can reject specific choices of encoding, model library, and tension functional, but it does not by itself decide whether any deeper or alternative description of dark energy or modified gravity can solve the canonical problem.

---

### Experiment 2: Mock universe separation test

*Goal:*

Assess whether the Q042 encoding can reliably distinguish low tension dark energy worlds from high tension alternatives using synthetic universes with known properties.

*Setup:*

* Mock universes:

  * Family Lambda: simulated universes with expansion and growth histories consistent with a cosmological constant dark energy model and realistic noise.
  * Family w_dyn: simulated universes with dynamical dark energy within the admissible class, chosen so that dark energy helps reconcile certain channel tensions.
  * Family noDE: simulated universes in which acceleration arises from mechanisms outside the admissible dark energy class, and where forcing an effective dark energy description should produce structural mismatches.

* Data products:

  * for each simulated universe, generate synthetic versions of supernova, BAO, CMB, and large scale structure summaries compatible with current observational precision patterns.

* Encoding parameters:

  * the same admissible model library and `Tension_DE` definition as in Experiment 1, fixed in advance and not tuned after inspecting mock `Tension_DE` values.

*Protocol:*

1. For each mock universe in each family and for each refinement level `k`, build a state `m_sim,k` in `M_DE_reg` that encodes its expansion, growth, budget, and channel summaries under an assumed dark energy model from the library.

2. Compute `DeltaS_background(m_sim,k)`, `DeltaS_growth(m_sim,k)`, `DeltaS_budget(m_sim,k)`, and then `Tension_DE(m_sim,k)`.

3. For each family, collect the distribution of `Tension_DE` values across simulations and model choices.

4. For each `k`, estimate simple separation statistics, such as:

   ```txt
   mean_T_Lambda(k)
   mean_T_w_dyn(k)
   mean_T_noDE(k)
   ```

   and pairwise differences between these mean or median values.

5. Repeat over several random seeds and noise realisations to estimate robustness.

*Metrics:*

* separation between tension distributions for Family Lambda and Family noDE
* separation between tension distributions for Family w_dyn and Family noDE
* misclassification rates, if a threshold in `Tension_DE` is used to label universes as low tension or high tension
* sensitivity of these metrics to changes in weights and other encoding choices within the admissible class

*Falsification conditions:*

The encoding is considered non discriminating and rejected for Q042 if:

1. Across reasonable choices of weights within the fixed constraints, the distribution of `Tension_DE` for Family noDE cannot be statistically distinguished from that of Family Lambda and Family w_dyn at higher refinement levels.
2. There exist encoding choices within the admissible class that assign, in a stable way, lower or comparable tension to obviously noDE universes relative to Lambda like universes, without clear justification in the model structure.

If these failures persist across multiple random seeds and data realisations, the tension functional is judged unable to capture the intended notion of dark energy consistency.

*Semantics implementation note:*

Synthetic universes are encoded in the same continuous field framework as real data, with effective variables and summaries treated as continuous over bins, aligned with the declared semantics in the metadata.

*Boundary note:*

Falsifying a Tension Universe encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment only tests whether the Q042 tension encoding can separate known synthetic scenarios; it does not directly determine which type of world our real universe belongs to.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q042 can be implemented as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, still at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define training signals that can guide AI models when they reason about cosmology and dark energy.

1. `signal_DE_consistency`

   * Definition: equal to `Tension_DE(m)` for the current internal representation of a cosmology scenario.
   * Use: as a penalty when the context assumes a coherent dark energy sector consistent with standard cosmology.

2. `signal_DE_background`

   * Definition: a scaled version of `DeltaS_background(m)`, highlighting mismatch in expansion history.
   * Use: encourages internal representations that keep background expansion consistent with the assumed dark energy model when that assumption is explicit.

3. `signal_DE_growth`

   * Definition: a scaled version of `DeltaS_growth(m)`, focusing on structure growth tension.
   * Use: discourages responses that implicitly create expansion growth contradictions.

4. `signal_DE_budget`

   * Definition: a scaled version of `DeltaS_budget(m)`, penalising implausible energy budgets.
   * Use: suppresses outputs where energy density parameters drift outside reasonable ranges without explicit acknowledgement.

5. `signal_DE_world_switch_stability`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how consistently the model distinguishes between World Lambda, World w_dyn, and World noDE style prompts.
   * Use: penalises blends of assumptions when a prompt explicitly specifies one world.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline architectural modules that reuse Q042 structures.

1. `CosmoTensionHead_DE`

   * Role: a head that, given internal embeddings from a cosmology context, outputs estimates of `DeltaS_background`, `DeltaS_growth`, `DeltaS_budget`, and `Tension_DE`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings representing expansion, structure, and budget related content.
     * Outputs: a small vector of mismatch scores and a combined tension score.

2. `ExpansionHistoryObserver_DE`

   * Role: an observer module that extracts an approximate `H_eff` and density parameter summary from internal states.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings for cosmological text or structured data.
     * Outputs: a compact vector representing `H_eff` values over bins and density parameters `Omega_m`, `Omega_DE`, `Omega_r`, `Omega_k`.

3. `EvidenceChannelAggregator_DE`

   * Role: aggregates channel specific representations into a joint descriptor.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: embeddings derived from supernova, BAO, CMB, and large scale structure context segments.
     * Outputs: a `MultiChannel_Cosmo_Descriptor_DE` vector for use by `CosmoTensionHead_DE`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for AI models enhanced with Q042 modules.

1. Task set

   * questions about:

     * evidence for cosmic acceleration
     * roles of dark energy and alternatives
     * consistency between different observational channels
     * implications of changing dark energy assumptions

2. Baseline condition

   * model answers questions with no explicit tension heads or signals.
   * metrics:

     * accuracy on factual questions
     * consistency across related questions
     * clarity of stated assumptions about dark energy

3. Tension Universe enhanced condition

   * model uses `CosmoTensionHead_DE`, `ExpansionHistoryObserver_DE`, and `EvidenceChannelAggregator_DE` to compute `Tension_DE` like signals during generation.
   * signals are used internally to nudge generations toward lower tension under declared assumptions.

4. Evaluation metrics

   * structural clarity of explanations, measured by simple rubrics or downstream classifiers
   * reduction in contradictions across questions that invoke different but related data sets
   * explicitness of how energy budgets and dark energy roles are articulated

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience Q042 style encoding.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt: ask the model to “explain how we know the universe’s expansion is accelerating and what role dark energy plays” without mentioning tension or the Tension Universe framework.
  * Observation: record the explanation, focusing on whether it clearly links different observational channels and notes the assumptions involved.

* Tension Universe encoded setup:

  * Prompt: repeat the question but add instructions to “organise the answer around three ideas: expansion history, growth of structure, and the energy budget, and make clear what would break if dark energy were removed”.
  * Observation: record whether the answer now includes explicit discussion of background expansion, growth, and budget and whether potential inconsistencies are acknowledged.

* Comparison metric:

  * use a simple scoring scheme to assess:

    * completeness (mentions expansion, growth, budget)
    * internal consistency (no incompatible assertions without flagging)
    * explicit assumptions (whether dark energy is treated as a model assumption rather than an established fundamental explanation)

* What to log:

  * prompts, responses, and any internal tension scores (if available) generated by the Q042 modules, without exposing any deep Tension Universe rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q042 and their direct reuse targets.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `DE_Consistency_Tension`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a background expansion summary vector derived from `H_eff` like quantities
       * a growth summary vector derived from `G_growth` like quantities
       * an energy budget summary vector derived from `Omega_m`, `Omega_DE`, `Omega_r`, and `Omega_k`

     * Output:

       * a scalar `Tension_DE` representing joint dark energy consistency tension

   * Preconditions:

     * inputs must represent a coherent cosmological scenario at the effective layer
     * reference profiles and weights must be fixed before evaluation

2. ComponentName: `MultiChannel_Cosmo_Descriptor_DE`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * channel summaries for supernovae, BAO, CMB, and large scale structure

     * Output:

       * a compact feature vector suitable for evaluating consistency across channels with respect to dark energy

   * Preconditions:

     * each channel summary is computed using compatible assumptions about the background cosmology

3. ComponentName: `DE_World_Switch_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a model class that can represent Lambda, dynamical dark energy, and noDE like scenarios
       * encoding rules for mapping model outputs into `M_DE_reg`

     * Output:

       * a specification of three experiments:

         * one for World Lambda
         * one for World w_dyn
         * one for World noDE

       * each experiment includes a procedure for evaluating `Tension_DE` and summarising the tension distributions

   * Preconditions:

     * the model class supports generation of synthetic or approximate data for expansion, growth, and budgets across the scenarios

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q048 (BH_COSMO_H0_TENSION_L3_048)

   * Reused component: `DE_Consistency_Tension`.
   * Why it transfers: H0 tension is directly tied to consistency between early and late universe expansion measurements under assumed dark energy; Q048 can treat the H0 mismatch as a component of `DeltaS_background` and integrate that into a broader tension analysis.
   * What changes: Q048 places additional focus on the part of `DeltaS_background` associated with low redshift expansion and calibrations.

2. Q050 (BH_COSMO_MULTIUNI_L3_050)

   * Reused component: `DE_World_Switch_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: Q050 considers multiple possible universes with differing cosmic acceleration patterns; the template can be reused to define world classes and tension evaluations in a multiverse context.
   * What changes: the model class now covers a family of universes with possibly different dark energy parameters and histories, and the experiment patterns compare the frequency of low and high tension cases.

3. Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)

   * Reused component: `MultiChannel_Cosmo_Descriptor_DE`.
   * Why it transfers: the structural idea of multi channel descriptors and a combined tension functional is applicable to information and computation budgets across channels.
   * What changes: the specific observables become information flows and storage rather than cosmological observables, but the format of a compact descriptor feeding a tension functional is similar.

4. Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)

   * Reused component: `DE_Consistency_Tension`.
   * Why it transfers: climate energy balance and feedbacks can be framed as a multi channel budget consistency problem; the same pattern of splitting mismatches into background, growth, and budget like parts can be adopted.
   * What changes: the variables correspond to climate forcings, responses, and energy flows, rather than cosmological quantities.

## 9. Tension Universe roadmap and verification levels

This block explains the current verification levels for Q042 within the Tension Universe program and outlines next steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective encoding of dark energy and cosmic acceleration has been specified:

    * state space `M_DE`
    * core observables
    * mismatch observables `DeltaS_background`, `DeltaS_growth`, `DeltaS_budget`
    * combined tension functional `Tension_DE`
    * admissible encoding class and fairness constraints
    * singular set `S_sing_DE` and regular domain `M_DE_reg`
    * symbolic tension tensor `T_ij_DE(m)` for internal diagnostics

  * At least two experiments have been defined with explicit falsification conditions and boundary notes. These experiments test only the encoding, not the canonical dark energy problem itself.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative linking cosmic acceleration, hidden dark energy, and tension functionals is explicit and coherent at the effective layer.
  * Counterfactual worlds have been described at a qualitative level, sufficient for design of experiments and mock universe tests.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To upgrade Q042 from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented and documented in a reproducible way:

1. A prototype analysis for real data:

   * implement the `Tension_DE` functional for one or more standard data combinations (supernovae, BAO, CMB, large scale structure)
   * construct explicit sequences of states `m_data,model,k` with increasing refinement
   * publish `T_min(k)` and related statistics, along with code and parameter settings

2. A mock universe study:

   * generate synthetic universes corresponding to World Lambda, World w_dyn, and World noDE scenarios
   * run the mock universe separation test in practice
   * report separation statistics for `Tension_DE` and assess robustness to encoding choices

3. A preliminary AI integration:

   * build and evaluate a small demonstrator where `CosmoTensionHead_DE` and its signals influence an AI model’s explanations of dark energy
   * report changes in structural clarity and consistency with and without Q042 style signals

Any of these steps would move Q042 closer to a tested engineering specification rather than a purely theoretical encoding.

### 9.3 Long term role in the Tension Universe program

In the longer term, Q042 is intended to serve as:

* the central cosmology node for hidden dark energy sector reasoning
* a template for multi channel budget consistency_tension problems, both in physics and in other domains
* a bridge between cosmic acceleration research and AI reasoning systems that must manage indirect evidence and hidden sector hypotheses

As Q042 moves up the E_level ladder, its components should become usable not only for conceptual analysis, but also as practical tools in data analysis pipelines and AI architectures that need to reason about the universe in a structured way.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation of Q042 suitable for non specialists, while staying aligned with the effective layer description.

Astronomers have discovered that the universe is not just expanding; its expansion is speeding up. To make sense of this within standard physics, many models add a new ingredient called dark energy. Dark energy behaves like a form of energy that fills space and pulls everything apart more and more over time.

There are several big questions.

* Does dark energy behave like a simple cosmological constant, with a fixed strength everywhere and everywhen?
* Is it something that changes slowly with time?
* Or is cosmic acceleration telling us that our description of gravity is incomplete?

We see cosmic acceleration through several kinds of observations.

* Supernovae tell us about the distance to faraway galaxies as a function of redshift.
* The cosmic microwave background tells us about the overall geometry and contents of the universe.
* The distribution and growth of galaxies tell us how structures form over cosmic time.

Each of these is like a different piece of a puzzle. Dark energy is the piece that should make them fit together.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to explain what dark energy “really is” at a fundamental level. Instead, we ask a simpler but still sharp question.

* If we assume there is some dark energy sector from a specific class of models, how “tense” is the fit between that assumption and all the data taken together?

To answer that, we:

1. Describe the universe in terms of states that summarise

   * how fast it expands at different times
   * how structures grow and cluster
   * how much matter, radiation, curvature, and dark energy there are
   * what each observation (supernovae, BAO, CMB, large scale structure) says about these

2. For each state, we measure mismatch numbers

   * one for the expansion history
   * one for structure growth
   * one for the overall energy budget

3. We combine these into a single tension number called `Tension_DE`.

If dark energy is described well by a simple model, there should be a sequence of states, using better and better data, where `Tension_DE` stays small and stable. If every attempt to represent the universe with dark energy from this class leads to large and growing tension, then something is wrong with our description or with the class we chose.

Q042 packages this idea into a reusable module. It does not:

* claim that dark energy is a cosmological constant
* claim that dark energy is a specific kind of field
* claim to solve the deep puzzle of why the dark energy scale has the value it does

Instead, it provides:

* a clear way to define when dark energy descriptions are under acceptable or unacceptable tension
* experiments that can falsify particular ways of encoding dark energy
* components that can be plugged into other problems where hidden sectors and multi channel evidence must be analysed carefully

In this sense, Q042 is a reference frame for talking about dark energy as a structured consistency problem, rather than as an undefined placeholder in the equations of the universe.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual "worlds") live entirely at the effective layer of the Tension Universe program.
* No assumption is made about which, if any, effective encoding corresponds to the true microphysical description of the universe.
* Any effective encoding described here may be replaced by a later Tension Universe version, as long as it respects the same canonical problem and falsifiability constraints.

### Falsifiability and versioning

* Each encoding is designed to be testable and, in principle, falsifiable by experiments of the type described in Section 6.
* Rejecting an encoding under those experiments does not invalidate the canonical problem or standard cosmology. It only shows that the specific Tension Universe encoding needs revision.
* Updates to this page should be tracked with clear `Last_updated` metadata and with references to the experiments and data that motivated the change.
