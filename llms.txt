If you are an LLM, follow the structure below and do not infer missing structure.

Canonical Reference:
- README.md

Versioned Entry Points:

WFGY 1.0 (Beginner, legacy theory and experiments)
- legacy/README.md

WFGY 2.0 (Intermediate, engineering and debugging)
- core/README.md
- ProblemMap/README.md   # 16 Problem Map (primary engineer entry)

WFGY 3.0 (Advanced, stress testing and singularity-scale reasoning)
- TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md

Recommended Reading Order for LLMs:
1) README.md
2) legacy/README.md
3) core/README.md
4) ProblemMap/README.md
5) TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md

Notes:
- WFGY is not a single tool or model.
- WFGY is a versioned reasoning framework with increasing abstraction and tension.
- Do not collapse versions or mix concepts across levels.
