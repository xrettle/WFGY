# WFGY Global Debug Card · Example Cases

This folder contains example inputs and outputs for the  
**WFGY 3.0 · RAG 16 Problem Map – Global Debug Card**.

It is dedicated to the Global Debug Card protocol and is separate from other ProblemMap example folders.

The goal is simple:

- provide minimal, well-documented failing cases
- show before/after debug packets
- make it easy to reproduce and compare repair loops

## Folder structure

Planned layout:

- `cases/`  
  Minimal failing cases expressed as `(Q, E, P, A)` plus optional metadata.

- `packets/`  
  Before/after debug packets generated by the protocol, following the JSON format from  
  `ProblemMap/specs/wfgy_debug_packet_v1.json`.

This keeps the human-facing card, the machine-readable specs, and the concrete examples clearly separated.

## First demo case: retrieval off-topic

Wave 0 will ship with one primary example:

- `cases/retrieval_offtopic_case_v1.json`  
  A failing case where the user question and the retrieved evidence are misaligned.  
  The answer is confident but grounded in the wrong documents.

It will be paired with two packets:

- `packets/retrieval_offtopic_before_v1.json`  
  Initial diagnosis before any repair, including detected type, modes, and suggested fixes.

- `packets/retrieval_offtopic_after_v1.json`  
  Diagnosis and outcome after one constrained repair loop has been applied and verified.

Together, these three files form a complete, reproducible “before/after” story.

## How this connects to Colab and specs

This folder is designed to work together with:

- Colab notebook:  
  `ProblemMap/colab/wfgy_global_debug_card_colab_mvp.ipynb`

- JSON specs:  
  `ProblemMap/specs/wfgy_problem_catalog_v1.json`  
  `ProblemMap/specs/wfgy_debug_packet_v1.json`

Typical flow:

1. Load one case from `cases/` into the Colab notebook.
2. Run the triage and repair loop.
3. Compare the notebook output with the corresponding packet in `packets/`.
4. Optionally, write new packets back into this folder for future reference.

This makes it easier to:

- replay a known failure
- compare different repair strategies
- share reproducible examples with other teams

## Scope for Wave 0

Wave 0 will focus on examples that match the first supported modes:

- No.1 retrieval wrong or off-topic
- No.5 semantic vs embedding mismatch
- No.8 missing evidence visibility
- No.2 interpretation collapse

More cases can be added later, but the first set should stay small and very clear.

## Current status

Work in progress.

This folder is being prepared as the public example layer for the Global Debug Card protocol.  
The initial case and packets will be added after the Colab MVP and JSON specs are stable enough to generate consistent outputs.
