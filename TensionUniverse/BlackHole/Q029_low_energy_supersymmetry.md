## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework, with `Semantics: continuous` and `Encoding_class: TU_effective_SUSY_lowenergy` as declared in the header.

* We work with:

  * state spaces,
  * observables,
  * invariants,
  * continuous tension scores,
  * falsifiable experiment templates.
* We do **not** specify or modify:

  * any underlying TU axiom system,
  * any TU core generating rules or deep field equations,
  * any explicit map from raw experimental data or ultraviolet theories into TU internal fields.

In particular:

* We do not claim to **prove** or **disprove** the canonical low energy supersymmetry statement in Section 1.
* We do not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* We do not give any explicit constructive procedure that turns collider events, lattice configurations, or quantum gravity candidates into unique TU field configurations.
* We only assume that there exist reproducible effective encodings whose summaries match the observables described in this document.

All tension values, mismatch scores and experiment protocols below are defined for a single encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` at the effective layer. Using a different encoding element would require a separate entry or an explicit version change.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

In high energy physics, supersymmetry is a proposed extension of the Standard Model where each known particle has at least one partner with different spin and related quantum numbers. At the level of effective field theory, typical constructions predict superpartners with masses not too far above the electroweak scale in order to stabilize that scale and to improve the unification of gauge couplings.

The canonical low energy supersymmetry question for this entry is:

> Does nature realize a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model in which superpartners of known particles exist at energies that are finite, dynamically relevant for the electroweak scale, and compatible with all current experimental bounds, so that low energy physics can be described by such a model without extreme fine tuning?

More concretely, we ask whether there exists a consistent and predictive theory with the following properties.

1. It contains the Standard Model as an effective low energy limit.
2. It has a supersymmetric structure in the ultraviolet, broken in such a way that:

   * superpartner masses lie in an energy range that is not arbitrarily higher than the electroweak scale, and
   * the required pattern of soft breaking terms does not introduce uncontrollable loss of predictivity.
3. It fits collider data, precision measurements and cosmological constraints within accepted error ranges.
4. It reduces the need for finely tuned cancellations in the Higgs sector when compared to non supersymmetric completions.

The existence or non existence of such a low energy supersymmetric description is an open structural question about the relation between high scale theory and the observed particle spectrum.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key aspects of the current status are:

* Models:

  * Many detailed supersymmetric models exist, such as the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model and various extensions with different mediation mechanisms.
  * These models supply concrete spectra of superpartners, patterns of couplings and specific phenomenological signatures.

* Experimental searches:

  * Extensive searches at the Large Hadron Collider have not observed superpartners.
  * Published bounds exclude large portions of parameter space where superpartners would be relatively light and easily produced.
  * Indirect constraints from precision measurements and flavor physics also push many simple spectra into tension with data.

* Remaining possibilities:

  * More complex breaking patterns and spectra with heavier or compressed superpartners remain possible.
  * Some scenarios hide supersymmetric signals in difficult final states or at higher masses that current colliders cannot probe.

* Conceptual difficulty:

  * The original motivation for low energy supersymmetry was naturalness of the electroweak scale and improved gauge coupling unification.
  * As bounds push superpartner masses higher, the quantitative gain in naturalness is reduced.
  * The field therefore faces a balance between accommodating data and preserving the original conceptual advantages.

The problem remains unsolved because:

* No experiment has definitively ruled out all reasonably constructed low energy supersymmetric models.
* No observation has definitively confirmed the existence of superpartners.
* It is hard to define a single sharp condition that completely separates acceptable and unacceptable models without invoking subjective choices about naturalness.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole and TU programs

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q029 serves three roles.

1. It is the primary node for supersymmetry as a `spectral_tension` problem, where:

   * a predicted partner spectrum is compared to the observed spectrum in specific energy windows, and
   * a separate tension captures how tuned the Higgs and related parameters appear in the absence of partners.

2. It provides a template for problems in which:

   * a long standing design principle such as low energy supersymmetry is tested against a growing body of data, and
   * both absence and presence of predicted structures produce characteristic patterns of tension.

3. It is a bridge between:

   * high level unification questions,
   * concrete collider and cosmological data,
   * and the way AI systems reason about incomplete structural hypotheses in physics.

In the TU framework, Q029 does not decide whether low energy supersymmetry is realized in nature. It defines how to **encode** the question as a continuous tension structure at the effective layer, in a form that can be audited and tested without touching TU core axioms.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q029 is placed in the BlackHole graph as a node with edges among Q001 to Q125. All edges are defined at the **effective layer** and reuse only the components and tension types specified in this entry. They do not claim any direct connection between underlying microscopic theories.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites or general structures that Q029 reuses at the effective layer.

* Q021 (Quantum gravity unification)
  Reason: provides the broader background where supersymmetry is one candidate ingredient and supplies high level constraints for the `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional` component.

* Q022 (Hierarchy problem)
  Reason: defines the general tension between the electroweak and high energy scales, which is then partially encoded in the `Hierarchy_Naturalness_Profile` observable used in Q029.

* Q033 (Selection among quantum gravity candidates)
  Reason: supplies a class of ultraviolet theories whose low energy shadows are filtered by the tension values computed in Q029.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse Q029 components or depend on its tension structure.

* Q041 (Nature of dark matter)
  Reason: reuses `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional` to evaluate supersymmetric dark matter candidates, coupling the spectral tension to relic density and detection constraints.

* Q025 (Baryon asymmetry of the universe)
  Reason: uses the `Hierarchy_Naturalness_Profile` and related tension patterns to restrict supersymmetric baryogenesis scenarios.

* Q040 (Black hole information problem)
  Reason: imports counterfactual world patterns from Q029 to decide which supersymmetric field theories are plausible building blocks for microscopic black hole models.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types with no direct component dependence.

* Q028 (Color confinement mechanism)
  Reason: both Q028 and Q029 use `spectral_tension` between predicted and observed spectra in gauge theories to organize unknown nonperturbative structure.

* Q036 (Microscopic mechanism of high temperature superconductivity)
  Reason: both involve emergent spectra where simple theories fail to match observed band structures, and both reuse generic ideas about missing or shifted spectral lines.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q029 to nodes in other domains that reuse its components.

* Q059 (Ultimate thermodynamic cost of information processing)
  Reason: reuses the idea that raising or lowering effective degrees of freedom changes tension between resource scales and operational behavior, in analogy with superpartners appearing or not appearing.

* Q123 (Scalable interpretability)
  Reason: reuses the pattern where a model predicts internal partner features that may or may not be present, guiding `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional` like modules for AI internal spectra.

* Q121 (AI alignment problem)
  Reason: uses the concept of design principles that may be structurally elegant but empirically stressed. Q029 offers a worked example of how tension measures can quantify this gap.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer and uses the `Semantics: continuous` convention. We describe state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores and singular sets for a single encoding class `TU_effective_SUSY_lowenergy`. We do not describe any hidden generative rules or any explicit map from raw experimental data or ultraviolet theories into TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a state space

```txt
M_SUSY
```

with the following effective interpretation.

* Each element `m` in `M_SUSY` represents a coherent low energy configuration that includes, in summarized form:

  * effective field theory parameters at and above the electroweak scale,
  * spectra of observed particles in one or more energy windows,
  * a candidate pattern of superpartner states, which may be empty,
  * a coarse summary of how sensitive the Higgs sector and related observables are to high scale variations.

* For any bounded energy window `E_window` that is relevant to present or near term experiments, there exist states `m` that summarize:

  * which particles and candidate superpartners are accessible in that window,
  * which portions of the parameter space are still allowed by current bounds.

The construction of these states from raw collider events, lattice simulations or ultraviolet models is not described here. We only assume that such effective summaries exist and can be treated as elements of `M_SUSY`.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

We introduce the following observables on `M_SUSY`.

1. Observed spectrum in an energy window

```txt
Spec_obs(m; E_window)
```

* Input: a state `m` and a bounded energy window `E_window`.
* Output: a finite summary of which particles are present, their masses and relevant quantum numbers, and which kinds of signals have been excluded in that window.
* This is treated as a structured but finite object that can be compared across states.

2. Reference supersymmetric spectrum

```txt
Spec_SUSY_ref(m; E_window; R_label)
```

* Input: a state `m`, an energy window `E_window`, and a label `R_label` that identifies an element of an admissible reference library.
* Output: a finite summary of the superpartner and Standard Model like spectrum that a specific low energy supersymmetric model would predict in the same window.
* The reference library is defined below in the invariants subsection.

3. Spectral mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label)
```

* Input: the same triple `(m, E_window, R_label)`.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar measuring mismatch between `Spec_obs` and `Spec_SUSY_ref`.
* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label) >= 0` for all admissible inputs.
  * `DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label) = 0` if the observed spectrum summary matches the reference spectrum summary in that window, according to a fixed comparison rule.

4. Naturalness mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_nat(m)
```

* Input: a state `m`.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar quantifying how tuned the Higgs sector and related parameters appear, relative to a class of low energy supersymmetric expectations.
* Properties:

  * `DeltaS_nat(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_SUSY`.
  * Smaller values indicate that moderate variations in underlying parameters do not produce extreme changes in the electroweak scale.
  * Larger values indicate that small shifts in underlying parameters would destroy the observed low energy structure.

5. Combined supersymmetry mismatch

For a fixed pair of nonnegative weights `w_spec` and `w_nat` with `w_spec + w_nat = 1`, we define:

```txt
DeltaS_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label) =
  w_spec * DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label)
  + w_nat * DeltaS_nat(m)
```

The weights are part of the encoding element and are chosen once for the entire Q029 program before looking at any particular data set. They are not tuned after tension values are observed.

### 3.3 Effective tension tensor components

We assume an effective tension tensor on `M_SUSY` of the form

```txt
T_ij(m; E_window; R_label) =
  S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label) * lambda(m) * kappa_SUSY
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source factor that encodes how strongly the i-th structural aspect of the configuration `m` is expected to excite supersymmetry related tension. For example, one index can correspond to the Higgs sector and another to gauge coupling unification.
* `C_j(m)` is a response factor that encodes how sensitive the j-th observational or reasoning channel is to supersymmetry related mismatches.
* `DeltaS_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label)` is the combined mismatch defined above.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor that follows the TU core constraints and stays within a fixed bounded interval. Its exact definition belongs to the TU core and is not specified here.
* `kappa_SUSY` is a global scaling constant for supersymmetry related tension in this encoding. Its value is part of the encoding element.

The sets of indices `i` and `j` are not specified in detail here. It is sufficient that for each relevant pair of indices the product is finite on the regular part of the state space defined below.

### 3.4 Invariants and effective constraints

We define invariants and constraints that make the encoding auditable.

#### 3.4.1 Admissible reference library

We define a finite or countable library

```txt
L_ref
```

of low energy supersymmetric spectra associated with `LibraryKey_ref_Q029`. Each element of the library has the following properties.

* It specifies a complete pattern of:

  * superpartner content up to a certain maximum energy,
  * mass ranges for each partner,
  * basic coupling patterns needed for consistency.
* It is defined without using any specific experimental data set.
* It is fixed before any tension calculations are performed for real world configurations.

For each library element, there is a label `R_label` that can be used in `Spec_SUSY_ref` and `DeltaS_spec`.

The admissible reference class is the fixed set `L_ref`. Encodings that change `L_ref` after inspecting observed spectra are treated as separate encoding elements and must be justified independently.

#### 3.4.2 Fairness and stability constraints

We impose the following constraints on the encoding.

1. Weight constraint:

   * The pair `(w_spec, w_nat)` must satisfy:

     * `w_spec >= 0`, `w_nat >= 0`, `w_spec + w_nat = 1`.
   * The chosen pair and the form of `G` in Section 4 are documented once under `WeightKey_Q029` and used for all states and experiments associated with this Q029 encoding.

2. Fairness constraint:

   * For any two states `m_1` and `m_2` that share the same observed spectrum and Higgs sector summaries, and that use the same `E_window` and `R_label`, the values of:

     * `DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label)`,
     * `DeltaS_nat(m)`,
     * `DeltaS_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label)`
   * must be identical within numerical accuracy.
   * In particular, tension values cannot be made artificially small or large by introducing hidden dependence on labels not listed in the interface.

3. Stability under moderate refinement:

   * Consider a sequence of states `m_k` that approximate the same physical configuration with increasing resolution, indexed by an integer `k >= 1`.
   * If the world is described by a genuinely low tension supersymmetric configuration, then for fixed `E_window` and `R_label` in the library, the sequence:

     * `Tension_SUSY(m_k; E_window; R_label)` defined in Section 4
   * must be bounded and must not oscillate wildly as `k` increases.
   * If moderate refinement produces arbitrarily large swings without clear physical reasons, the encoding is considered unstable.

#### 3.4.3 Summary invariants

We define two simple invariants for later use.

1. Window averaged spectral mismatch.

```txt
I_spec(m) =
  average over a fixed finite family of windows E_window_q
  of DeltaS_spec(m; E_window_q; R_label_q)
```

where the windows and labels are part of a test protocol and do not depend on `m`.

2. Naturalness profile invariant.

```txt
I_nat(m) = DeltaS_nat(m)
```

This records the naturalness mismatch as a single scalar.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may not support well defined or finite mismatch observables. We collect them in a singular set.

```txt
S_sing_SUSY =
  { m in M_SUSY :
    DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label)
    or DeltaS_nat(m)
    is undefined or not finite for at least one admissible test pair
  }
```

We define the regular part of the state space as:

```txt
M_SUSY_reg = M_SUSY \ S_sing_SUSY
```

All supersymmetry related tension analysis in this entry is restricted to `M_SUSY_reg`. When an experiment encounters a state in `S_sing_SUSY`, this is treated as an indication that the state is outside the domain of the Q029 encoding, not as evidence for or against low energy supersymmetry.

### 3.6 Encoding element for Q029

For Q029 we define a single encoding element at the effective layer:

```txt
E_SUSY_Q029_V1 =
  (Encoding_class,
   EncodingKey_Q029,
   LibraryKey_ref_Q029,
   WeightKey_Q029,
   M_SUSY_reg,
   L_ref,
   G,
   kappa_SUSY)
```

with the following properties.

* `Encoding_class` is `TU_effective_SUSY_lowenergy`, as declared in the header.
* `EncodingKey_Q029 = E_SUSY_Q029_V1` identifies this concrete encoding element.
* `LibraryKey_ref_Q029` identifies the admissible reference library `L_ref` of supersymmetric spectra.
* `WeightKey_Q029` identifies the chosen weights `(w_spec, w_nat)` and the function `G` used in Section 4.
* `M_SUSY_reg` is the regular domain on which all tension evaluations are defined.
* `kappa_SUSY` is a fixed global scaling constant for this encoding.
* All experiments, counterfactual worlds, AI components and transfer templates in this entry are assumed to use `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` unless a different encoding element is explicitly declared.

Any future revision that changes `L_ref`, `G`, the weights, or the domain must be registered as a new encoding element with a different `EncodingKey_Q029` and a different `Last_updated` date.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q029 is characterized as a tension problem in the TU framework, at the effective layer and under the encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define the supersymmetry tension functional as:

```txt
Tension_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label) =
  G(DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label), DeltaS_nat(m))
```

for some fixed function `G` with the following properties.

* `G(x, y) >= 0` for all `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.
* `G(x, y)` is nondecreasing in each argument.
* `G(0, 0) = 0`.

In this Q029 entry we adopt the **linear** choice

```txt
G(x, y) = w_spec * x + w_nat * y
```

with `(w_spec, w_nat)` as specified by `WeightKey_Q029`. With this choice we have, for all admissible inputs,

```txt
Tension_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label) =
  DeltaS_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label)
```

The choice of `G` and the weights belongs to `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` and is not changed when particular worlds, data sets or models are considered.

### 4.2 Low energy supersymmetry as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, the low energy supersymmetry existence question can be phrased as:

> Are there world representing states in `M_SUSY_reg` for which the supersymmetry tension functional stays in a stable low band across refinements of the encoding, given a fixed admissible reference library and fixed weights?

More concretely:

* Fix once and for all for a given experiment:

  * a reference library `L_ref`,
  * weights `(w_spec, w_nat)` and the linear `G`,
  * a finite family of windows `E_window_q` and labels `R_label_q`,
  * small thresholds `epsilon_SUSY(q)` for each window.
    These choices are part of the experiment protocol and must be specified before any tension evaluation.

* Consider a sequence of states `m_k` that increasingly accurately summarize the real world in those windows while remaining in `M_SUSY_reg`.

Low energy supersymmetry existence corresponds, in this encoding, to the possibility that:

```txt
for sufficiently large k,
Tension_SUSY(m_k; E_window_q; R_label_q)
  <= epsilon_SUSY(q)
for all q
```

where each `epsilon_SUSY(q)` is a small threshold chosen in advance based on theoretical expectations and known uncertainties, and where these thresholds do not need to be made arbitrarily large as the resolution improves.

### 4.3 Absence of low energy supersymmetry as persistent high tension

If low energy supersymmetry is absent, then any encoding that remains faithful to observed spectra and the Higgs sector is expected to exhibit persistent high tension somewhere in the relevant family of windows.

In this case, for any choice of admissible library `L_ref` and weights that preserves the general physical meaning of spectral and naturalness mismatch, there will exist:

* at least one window index `q_star`, and
* a sequence of states `m_k` in `M_SUSY_reg` approximating the real world,

such that the corresponding tension values satisfy:

```txt
Tension_SUSY(m_k; E_window_q_star; R_label_q_star)
  >= delta_SUSY
for all sufficiently large k
```

with a strictly positive threshold `delta_SUSY` that is fixed in advance as part of the experiment protocol. This threshold cannot be reduced to an arbitrarily small value without conflicting with the observed mismatch between predicted and observed structures.

This formulation does not decide between the two possibilities. It only states how the tension functional would behave if one or the other scenario is realized, under a fixed encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer, both using the same encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` with fixed `L_ref`, weights and function `G`.

* World T: low energy supersymmetry exists in a form that meaningfully reduces tension.
* World F: low energy supersymmetry does not exist in any such form.

These are descriptions of patterns in observables, not constructions of microscopic theories.

### 5.1 World T (low energy supersymmetry present)

In World T, there exist world representing states `m_T` in `M_SUSY_reg` with the following properties.

1. Partner spectrum:

   * For each relevant `E_window`, there exist labels `R_label` in the reference library such that:

     * `Spec_obs(m_T; E_window)` and `Spec_SUSY_ref(m_T; E_window; R_label)` are closely aligned.
     * `DeltaS_spec(m_T; E_window; R_label)` remains inside a small band for those windows.

2. Naturalness:

   * `DeltaS_nat(m_T)` is small, meaning that:

     * modest variations in high scale parameters do not destroy the observed electroweak scale in the encoded configuration.
     * the Higgs sector is not significantly more tuned than in typical supersymmetric benchmark models in the library.

3. Running and unification:

   * If encoded, gauge coupling running patterns are closer to a unified picture than in non supersymmetric models with similar assumptions, contributing to low `DeltaS_nat(m_T)` or related observables.

4. Global tension:

   * The combined tension evaluation satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_SUSY(m_T; E_window_q; R_label_q)
       <= epsilon_SUSY(q)
     ```

     for all windows `q` in the tested family, with thresholds chosen as in Section 4.2.

### 5.2 World F (low energy supersymmetry absent)

In World F, there exist world representing states `m_F` in `M_SUSY_reg` with the following properties.

1. Missing partners:

   * For each library element and each realistic `E_window`, attempts to align `Spec_obs(m_F; E_window)` with `Spec_SUSY_ref(m_F; E_window; R_label)` lead to:

     * persistent gaps where predicted partners do not appear,
     * or required mass shifts that are inconsistent with other constraints.

   * As a result, `DeltaS_spec(m_F; E_window; R_label)` stays above a nontrivial lower bound for at least some windows.

2. Growing naturalness tension:

   * As experimental bounds move upward, the encoded state sequence `m_k` yields increasing `DeltaS_nat(m_k)`:

     * achieving the observed electroweak scale requires greater cancellation among inputs,
     * the encoded sensitivity of the Higgs scale to high scale parameters grows.

3. Limited unification gain:

   * If gauge coupling running is encoded, any improvement in unification compared to non supersymmetric models is marginal or requires special parameter choices that increase `DeltaS_nat`.

4. Global tension:

   * For at least one window index `q_star`, the combined tension satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_SUSY(m_k; E_window_q_star; R_label_q_star)
       >= delta_SUSY
     ```

     beyond some refinement level, with `delta_SUSY` positive and fixed ahead of time as in Section 4.3.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual descriptions do not claim to construct microscopic models or to prove anything about nature. They only specify how effective tension observables would differ between two broad scenarios, given the fixed encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`. They can be used to design experiments and reasoning tests without crossing the boundary into deep generative rules.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can test and potentially falsify particular Q029 encodings at the effective layer. They do not prove or disprove the canonical statement itself. All experiments in this section assume the encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` unless stated otherwise.

### Experiment 1: Collider spectrum tension trajectory

**Goal**

Test whether a given Q029 encoding tracks the growing pressure on low energy supersymmetry as collider bounds become stronger.

**Setup**

* Select a sequence of published collider data sets that progressively increase lower bounds on superpartner masses.
* For each data set, construct a state `m_data_k` in `M_SUSY_reg` that summarizes:

  * observed spectra up to a certain energy,
  * excluded regions of parameter space.
* Fix in advance, as part of the experiment protocol:

  * the reference library `L_ref` identified by `LibraryKey_ref_Q029`,
  * the weights `(w_spec, w_nat)` and linear `G` identified by `WeightKey_Q029`,
  * a finite family of energy windows and labels `(E_window_q, R_label_q)`,
  * thresholds `epsilon_SUSY(q)` and `T_max_expected(q)` for each window,
  * a critical fraction `p_crit` in the interval `(0, 1)`.

These choices must not be changed after looking at the data. Any change creates a new experiment version.

**Protocol**

1. For each `k` in the sequence of data sets:

   * instantiate `m_data_k` as the effective summary for that stage. Ensure that `m_data_k` lies in `M_SUSY_reg`.

2. For each `q` in the family of windows:

   * compute `DeltaS_spec(m_data_k; E_window_q; R_label_q)`,
   * compute `DeltaS_nat(m_data_k)`,
   * compute

     ```txt
     Tension_SUSY(m_data_k; E_window_q; R_label_q)
     ```

3. Record the trajectories of these quantities as `k` increases.

4. Compare observed trends with the qualitative expectation that:

   * if superpartners remain hidden but heavy, naturalness tension should increase,
   * if supersymmetry is realized with still viable spectra, tension may stabilize or grow only slowly.

**Metrics**

* For each window `q`:

  * the sequence of averages over `k` of `Tension_SUSY(m_data_k; E_window_q; R_label_q)`,
  * the rate at which `DeltaS_nat(m_data_k)` increases with `k`.
* Aggregate measures:

  * the maximum tension value across all `q` for each `k`,
  * a simple trend indicator such as a fitted slope for the average tension as a function of `k`.

**Falsification conditions**

* Let `T_max_expected(q)` be a pre declared upper bound for tension in a world where a viable low energy supersymmetric configuration still exists and is compatible with the library `L_ref`.

* The encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` is considered falsified for this experiment if:

  * for every choice of implementation details that obeys the fairness and stability constraints, and
  * for all sufficiently large `k` in the data sequence,
  * more than the fixed fraction `p_crit` of windows satisfy:

    Tension_SUSY(m_data_k; E_window_q; R_label_q)
      > T_max_expected(q)
    ```

* The encoding is also rejected for this experiment if:

  * small, unmotivated changes in the numerical implementation of `DeltaS_spec` or `DeltaS_nat` cause large, discontinuous jumps in tension trajectories that cannot be attributed to changes in the input data, which indicates instability relative to the definitions in Section 3.

**Semantics implementation note**

All quantities in this experiment are treated as real valued continuous fields or scalars in the sense implied by the metadata. No discrete or hybrid representation is introduced here, and all comparisons are performed in that same interpretation.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying or rejecting `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` in this experiment does **not** solve the canonical low energy supersymmetry problem. It only shows that this particular effective layer encoding fails to track the collider tension in a stable and fair way.

### Experiment 2: Synthetic model world separation

**Goal**

Assess whether the Q029 encoding systematically assigns lower tension to synthetic supersymmetric model families than to non supersymmetric ones under comparable constraints.

**Setup**

* Construct two model libraries:

  * `Family_T`:

    * low energy effective theories with explicit superpartners and parameter choices that yield moderate tuning.
  * `Family_F`:

    * non supersymmetric or highly tuned models that reproduce current data but lack partner spectra or require severe cancellations.
* For each model instance, construct a state in `M_SUSY_reg` encoding:

  * the predicted low energy spectrum in a set of energy windows,
  * a summary of parameter sensitivity for the Higgs sector.

All states must respect the same encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`.

* Fix in advance:

  * the reference library `L_ref`,
  * the same weights `(w_spec, w_nat)` and function `G` as in Experiment 1,
  * a family of windows `(E_window_q, R_label_q)`,
  * a low tension threshold `T_low`,
  * a separation margin `delta_sep > 0`.

**Protocol**

1. For each model `u` in `Family_T`:

   * construct a state `m_T_u` in `M_SUSY_reg`,
   * evaluate `DeltaS_spec(m_T_u; E_window_q; R_label_q)` for all test windows,
   * evaluate `DeltaS_nat(m_T_u)`,
   * compute `Tension_SUSY(m_T_u; E_window_q; R_label_q)` and aggregate over `q` with a fixed rule to obtain an aggregate tension `T_agg_T(u)`.
2. Repeat the same steps for each model `v` in `Family_F`, yielding states `m_F_v` and aggregate tensions `T_agg_F(v)`.
3. Build two distributions:

   * the distribution of `T_agg_T(u)` over `Family_T`,
   * the distribution of `T_agg_F(v)` over `Family_F`.
4. Compare the two distributions using simple distance measures.

**Metrics**

* The mean aggregate tension for `Family_T` and for `Family_F`.
* The fraction of models in `Family_T` whose aggregate tension is below the fixed threshold `T_low`.
* The fraction of models in `Family_F` whose aggregate tension is below the same threshold.
* A simple overlap metric, such as the fraction of pairs where a typical `Family_T` model has lower tension than a typical `Family_F` model.

**Falsification conditions**

* With `T_low` and `delta_sep` fixed in advance, the encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` is considered ineffective and rejected for this experiment if:

  * the difference between the mean aggregate tension of `Family_F` and that of `Family_T` is less than `delta_sep`, and
  * the fraction of `Family_F` models with tension below `T_low` is comparable to or greater than that for `Family_T`.
* If the encoding assigns lower aggregate tension to a substantial fraction of clearly non supersymmetric `Family_F` models than to typical supersymmetric `Family_T` models, the encoding is misaligned with its intended meaning and is rejected for this use.

**Semantics implementation note**

The synthetic models and their observables are treated in the same continuous field style as for real collider data. The encoding does not change interpretation when switching between real and synthetic worlds.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying or rejecting `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` in this experiment does not solve the canonical low energy supersymmetry problem. It only shows that this encoding fails to separate supersymmetric and non supersymmetric model families in the intended way.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q029 structures can be used as engineering modules in AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer and under the encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`. All training signals and modules treat `Tension_SUSY` and related quantities as continuous fields derived from this encoding element.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used in AI models that reason about particle physics and beyond Standard Model theories.

1. `signal_susy_spectrum_consistency`

   * Definition:

     * A nonnegative signal built from `DeltaS_spec(m; E_window; R_label)` averaged over a family of windows.
   * Purpose:

     * Encourage internal representations that keep predicted and described spectra consistent, given a chosen supersymmetric reference.

2. `signal_naturalness_penalty`

   * Definition:

     * A penalty term proportional to `DeltaS_nat(m)` in contexts where reduced tuning is part of the assumed background.
   * Purpose:

     * Make the model aware that certain statements imply high or low levels of tuning, without enforcing any particular conclusion.

3. `signal_susy_tension_score`

   * Definition:

     * Directly equal to an aggregate version of `Tension_SUSY(m; E_window; R_label)` across relevant windows.
   * Purpose:

     * Provide a scalar target for modules that estimate how strained a given low energy description is with respect to supersymmetry.

4. `signal_counterfactual_stability`

   * Definition:

     * A signal measuring how stable the model reasoning remains when toggling between World T and World F style assumptions in otherwise similar prompts.
   * Purpose:

     * Encourage the model to clearly separate arguments that depend on assuming supersymmetry from those that do not.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q029 structures without revealing any deep TU rules.

1. `SUSY_TensionHead`

   * Role:

     * A network head that takes internal representations of a physics context and outputs an estimate of aggregate `Tension_SUSY`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: embeddings representing the current description of particle content and parameters.
     * Output: a scalar tension estimate plus optional decomposed contributions from spectral and naturalness components.

2. `Hierarchy_Consistency_Filter`

   * Role:

     * A filter that checks whether proposed explanations for the electroweak scale are compatible with low naturalness tension in a given scenario.
   * Interface:

     * Input: candidate explanations or intermediate reasoning states.
     * Output: scores or soft masks indicating whether the explanations correspond to low, medium or high `DeltaS_nat`.

3. `Model_Class_Selector`

   * Role:

     * A module that, given a high level question, suggests which families in the admissible reference library `L_ref` are worth considering.
   * Interface:

     * Input: a description of the question and known constraints.
     * Output: a small set of `R_label` values that represent promising reference spectra for further exploration.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We give a simple evaluation harness for AI systems that incorporate Q029 modules.

1. Task selection:

   * Create or select benchmarks of questions about:

     * supersymmetry motivations and alternatives,
     * collider bounds and their implications,
     * the hierarchy problem and its proposed solutions.

2. Conditions:

   * Baseline condition:

     * the AI model answers without explicit Q029 style tension modules.
   * Q029 augmented condition:

     * the AI model uses `SUSY_TensionHead` and `Hierarchy_Consistency_Filter` as auxiliary components during reasoning.

3. Metrics:

   * Factual accuracy on well defined questions about supersymmetry.
   * Internal consistency:

     * frequency with which the model contradicts its own earlier statements about tuning or spectral expectations.
   * Structural clarity:

     * a qualitative score for how clearly the model separates:

       * what would be true if supersymmetry exists,
       * what would be true if it does not.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to observe the effect of Q029 style encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt:

    * ask the AI to explain why supersymmetry was proposed, how it would manifest at colliders, and what current non observation means, without any mention of tension.
  * Observation:

    * record the answer and note whether it:

      * mixes motivations with current status in a confusing way,
      * fails to clearly separate naturalness and unification arguments,
      * treats bounds as a simple yes or no matter.

* Q029 encoded setup:

  * Prompt:

    * ask the same set of questions, but instruct the AI to organize the discussion around:

      * spectral mismatch between predicted partners and observed spectra,
      * naturalness mismatch in the Higgs sector,
      * how these combine into a supersymmetry tension measure.
  * Observation:

    * record the answer and look for:

      * explicit mention of partner spectra,
      * clear articulation of tuning issues,
      * explanation of how stronger bounds shift tension.

* Comparison metric:

  * Use a simple rubric that rates:

    * structure,
    * explicitness of key components,
    * internal consistency between different parts of the explanation.
  * Optionally, have independent readers decide which answer better captures the present situation in particle physics.

* What to log:

  * For both setups log:

    * prompts,
    * full responses,
    * any auxiliary tension estimates produced by Q029 modules.
  * This allows inspection of how reasoning changes when tension aware components are active.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components produced by Q029 and gives direct reuse targets. All components inherit the encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` by default. Downstream nodes may either reuse this encoding element or explicitly register a new one.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * `Spec_obs(m; E_window)`
       * `Spec_SUSY_ref(m; E_window; R_label)`
       * `DeltaS_nat(m)`
     * Output:

       * `Tension_SUSY_agg(m)` as a nonnegative scalar.
   * Preconditions:

     * The inputs summarize a coherent low energy configuration in `M_SUSY_reg`.
     * The reference library and weights used to build `Tension_SUSY_agg` are documented and fixed under `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`.

2. ComponentName: `Hierarchy_Naturalness_Profile`

   * Type: observable
   * Minimal interface:

     * Input:

       * state `m` with encoded information about the Higgs sector and its sensitivity to high scale variations.
     * Output:

       * a scalar or short vector representing naturalness mismatch, compatible with `DeltaS_nat(m)`.
   * Preconditions:

     * The state must include enough information to assess how electroweak scale quantities depend on upstream parameters in the chosen effective theory.

3. ComponentName: `SUSY_World_Counterfactual_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs:

       * a description of model classes and bounds for use in World T and World F style scenarios.
     * Output:

       * a pair of test definitions that instantiate World T and World F tension evaluations using the same encoding machinery.
   * Preconditions:

     * The model classes must support construction of states in `M_SUSY_reg` with consistent summaries.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q022 (Hierarchy problem)

   * Reused component:

     * `Hierarchy_Naturalness_Profile`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Q022 concerns the general question of why the electroweak scale is small compared to high scales. The naturalness profile observable is relevant regardless of whether supersymmetry is the chosen solution.
   * What changes:

     * The reference expectations are widened to include non supersymmetric and other beyond Standard Model scenarios. A new encoding element may be registered if the library or weights differ significantly.

2. Q041 (Nature of dark matter)

   * Reused component:

     * `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Many dark matter models are supersymmetric. The functional can help quantify whether a given dark matter candidate is compatible with tension levels implied by low energy spectra and bounds.
   * What changes:

     * Additional inputs are added to account for relic density and detection constraints, and these are folded into extended tension summaries. The node can either extend `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` or declare a new encoding element.

3. Q033 (Selection among quantum gravity candidates)

   * Reused component:

     * `SUSY_World_Counterfactual_Template`.
   * Why it transfers:

     * Quantum gravity candidates often predict different low energy structures, including or excluding supersymmetry. Counterfactual templates allow testing how each candidate would project into World T and World F style tension patterns.
   * What changes:

     * The model classes considered in the template are now full quantum gravity inspired effective theories instead of simple low energy models.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block specifies the current verification levels for Q029 and the next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective encoding has:

    * a clear state space description,
    * defined mismatch observables,
    * a combined tension functional,
    * a singular set and domain restriction,
    * at least two experiments with explicit falsification conditions,
    * a single encoding element `E_SUSY_Q029_V1` declared and used consistently.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative:

    * identifies the canonical problem,
    * links spectral and naturalness tension,
    * sets up World T and World F descriptions,
    * states how experiments test the encoding without overclaiming,
    * explains how AI and cross domain modules reuse the same encoding element.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be achieved.

1. Implement a finite reference library `L_ref` with explicit representative supersymmetric spectra and publish:

   * the chosen weights,
   * the detailed comparison rules used to compute `DeltaS_spec` and `DeltaS_nat`,
   * example calculations of `Tension_SUSY` for a documented set of synthetic and data informed states.

2. Run a complete version of Experiment 1 using:

   * a public sequence of collider data summaries,
   * clearly specified state construction protocols that others can emulate,
   * a public record of the resulting tension trajectories.

These steps remain at the effective layer. They make the encoding more concrete and reproducible without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q029 is expected to serve as:

* a canonical example of how to treat a structural physics hypothesis that has strong theoretical motivations but ambiguous experimental status,
* a template for encoding and testing design principles in other domains where planned structures might or might not be realized,
* a bridge between:

  * high energy theory,
  * collider phenomenology,
  * and AI based reasoning about incomplete structural information.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a nontechnical explanation that remains faithful to the effective layer description.

Physicists once hoped that supersymmetry would show up not too far above the energies that we can reach in colliders. In that picture, every known particle would have a partner. Those partners would help keep the electroweak scale stable and make certain patterns in the forces look more natural.

So far, experiments have not seen any of these partners. That leaves us in an in between situation. Supersymmetry is not clearly confirmed, but it is also not clearly ruled out. Some models survive, others do not.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to decide the question directly. Instead, we ask how much strain exists between:

* what our theories say about partner particles and tuning,
* what experiments tell us about the spectrum we actually see.

We do this by:

1. Imagining a space of states. Each state is a compact summary of:

   * which particles have been seen in a given energy range,
   * which kinds of superpartners would still be allowed,
   * how tuned the Higgs sector looks in that picture.

2. For each state, we measure:

   * how different the observed spectrum is from a library of reference supersymmetric spectra,
   * how much fine tuning appears necessary to keep the electroweak scale where it is.

3. We combine these into a single number, a supersymmetry tension score, built from a fixed recipe that is part of `E_SUSY_Q029_V1`.

Then we consider two broad possibilities.

* In a world where low energy supersymmetry really exists:

  * we should be able to find states where this tension score stays low and stable as we refine our description.
* In a world without such supersymmetry:

  * missing partner signals and growing tuning should force the tension score to stay high, no matter how we refine our description, as long as we follow fair rules and use the same reference library.

This does not tell us which world we live in. It tells us how to:

* encode the question in terms of observable summaries,
* test proposed ways of measuring tension,
* and organize AI reasoning so that it does not ignore either the growing pressure from data or the original motivations for supersymmetry.

This explanation, like the rest of the entry, stays at the effective layer and does not claim to solve the canonical low energy supersymmetry problem.

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** BlackHole S-problem collection and describes the Q029 node only at the effective layer.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the low energy supersymmetry existence problem.
* It does **not** claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does **not** introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should **not** be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved, that supersymmetry exists, or that it does not exist.

### Effective layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M_SUSY`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live inside a single TU effective layer encoding class `TU_effective_SUSY_lowenergy`.
* No TU core axioms, deep field equations, or generating rules are exposed or modified in this entry.
* No explicit mapping from raw data or ultraviolet theories to TU internal fields is given. Only the existence of reproducible encodings that match the listed observables is assumed.

### Encoding and fairness

* All experiments, tension functionals and AI modules in this page are defined with respect to the encoding element

  ```txt
  E_SUSY_Q029_V1
  ```

  identified in the header and in Section 3.6.
* Any change to the reference library `L_ref`, to the weights `(w_spec, w_nat)`, or to the function `G` must be registered as a new encoding element with a different `EncodingKey_Q029` and `Last_updated` value.
* Fairness and stability constraints in Section 3.4 limit how tension scores may depend on the inputs. Hidden or data dependent changes to these definitions invalidate comparisons and must not be described as the same encoding.

### Cross problem reuse

* Components such as `SUSY_Spectrum_Tension_Functional`, `Hierarchy_Naturalness_Profile`, and `SUSY_World_Counterfactual_Template` are intended for reuse by other BlackHole nodes and AI systems at the effective layer.
* Reuse of these components does not assert that supersymmetry is realized in nature. It only asserts that similar patterns of spectral and naturalness tension can be encoded and tested in other contexts.
* Downstream nodes that significantly change the reference library or tension recipe should declare their own encoding keys and charters.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters, which govern the global rules for effective layer encodings, fairness and tension scales in the Tension Universe program:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
