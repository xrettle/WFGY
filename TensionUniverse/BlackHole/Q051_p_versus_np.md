## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

This document works strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* It does not modify, extend, or reinterpret the canonical mathematical statement of the P versus NP problem.
  All complexity classes and notions in Section 1 follow standard references such as Sipser and Arora–Barak.
* It does not introduce any new theorem about P, NP, or NP complete problems.
  It does not claim to prove P equals NP or P differs from NP.
* It only defines:

  * a discrete state space of configurations,
  * observables that measure search and verification costs,
  * gap functionals and tension scores,
  * experiment patterns that can falsify specific encodings inside the TU framework.
* It assumes, but does not derive, the TU Effective Layer Charter and the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.
  All encodings in this file must satisfy those charters plus the additional constraints in Section 3.2.
* All references to “faithful encodings” mean: encodings that

  * adopt the canonical P, NP, NP complete definitions without alteration,
  * respect the admissible encoding class and fairness constraints in Section 3.2,
  * do not bake in any presumed answer to P versus NP through resource scales, benchmark selection, or library design.
* Any experiment that falsifies the encoding specified by `Encoding_key: ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1` invalidates this encoding.
  It does not imply any resolution of the canonical P versus NP problem.

Readers should treat this page as a description of one permitted effective layer encoding and a set of tests that this encoding must pass.
It is not evidence that the underlying open problem has been solved.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

We work with decision problems and deterministic or nondeterministic algorithms on finite strings over a fixed alphabet.

Class `P` is the class of languages that can be decided by a deterministic Turing machine in time bounded by some polynomial in the input length `n`.

Class `NP` is the class of languages `L` such that there exists a polynomial time deterministic Turing machine `V` and a polynomial `p` with the following property. For every input `x`:

* if `x` is in `L` then there exists a certificate `y` with length at most `p(|x|)` such that `V(x, y)` accepts;
* if `x` is not in `L` then for every `y` with length at most `p(|x|)` the machine `V(x, y)` rejects.

The P versus NP problem asks:

> Is `P` equal to `NP` or not.

Equivalently, is there a language in `NP` that is not in `P`.

A standard reformulation uses NP complete problems. A language `L` is NP complete if `L` is in `NP` and every language in `NP` can be reduced to `L` by a polynomial time many one reduction.

Then `P` equals `NP` if and only if some NP complete language is in `P`.
The P versus NP problem can therefore also be stated as:

> Does any NP complete language admit a deterministic polynomial time decision algorithm.

All of these definitions follow standard complexity theory and are not modified by this document.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The P versus NP problem is open. No proof is known that `P = NP`. No proof is known that `P ≠ NP`.

The problem is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems and is widely regarded as a central open question in theoretical computer science and mathematics. A proof either way would have major consequences for algorithms, cryptography, combinatorics, optimization, and many other fields.

Partial information includes:

* Many natural problems are known to be NP complete, for example Boolean satisfiability, Hamiltonian cycle, and many scheduling and optimization problems.
* Strong evidence from cryptography and complexity theory suggests that some NP problems are inherently hard on average under widely used input distributions. This is not a proof that `P ≠ NP`.
* There are relativized worlds and algebraic or restricted models where analogues of P versus NP can be resolved, and the answers can differ between those models.
  This suggests that certain proof techniques are unlikely to resolve the real P versus NP question.

No consensus proof strategy is currently accepted as close to complete.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection Q051 has three main roles.

1. It is the primary example of a computational_tension problem where the mismatch between search power and verification power is central.
2. It anchors a family of complexity and algorithmic hardness problems, including:

   * Q052 (average case variants),
   * Q053 (fine grained complexity),
   * Q054 (proof complexity),
   * Q055 (cryptographic hardness).
3. It provides a template for encoding complexity theoretic questions in the Tension Universe effective layer, using discrete state spaces, resource measures, and gap style invariants.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q051 sits inside the BlackHole graph over Q001 to Q125.
Each edge has a short reason that points to a concrete component or tension structure.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide foundations or tools that Q051 uses at the effective layer.

* Q016 (`BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016`)
  Reason: supplies the set theoretic background and standard models of computation needed to treat Turing machines and complexity classes inside a discrete field.

* Q047 (`BH_CS_MODEL_OF_COMP_L3_047`)
  Reason: encodes the effective layer conventions for Turing machines, RAM models, and polynomial time as discrete resource measures.

* Q050 (`BH_CS_VERIF_VS_SEARCH_L3_050`)
  Reason: provides the general framework for comparing search tasks and verification tasks and defines baseline computational_tension quantities.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems use Q051 components directly or treat P versus NP as a prerequisite.

* Q052 (`BH_CS_AVGCASE_PVNP_L3_052`)
  Reason: reuses Q051 tension components for distributions over inputs and average case hardness invariants.

* Q053 (`BH_CS_FINEGRAINED_L3_053`)
  Reason: uses the Q051 encoding of problems and resource gaps and refines it to more precise running time exponents.

* Q055 (`BH_CS_CRYPTO_HARDNESS_L3_055`)
  Reason: depends on the separation between efficient verification and efficient computation as encoded in Q051 to describe cryptographic hardness assumptions.

* Q123 (`BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123`)
  Reason: uses Q051 style discrete tension measures to study how AI models allocate internal resources between search like and verification like tasks.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* Q001 (`BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001`)
  Reason: both Q001 and Q051 study a gap between an existence or membership statement and what can be verified or computed with limited resources, and both use tension scores between ideal models and actual behavior.

* Q072 (`BH_ECON_MARKET_COMP_L3_072`)
  Reason: both encode a mismatch between local decision complexity and global optimization structure and use computational_tension like invariants.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

These connections reuse Q051 components in other domains.

* Q059 (`BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059`)
  Reason: uses P versus NP style resource gaps as discrete analogues of thermodynamic free energy gaps for information processing tasks.

* Q080 (`BH_SOCIAL_ALGO_GOV_L3_080`)
  Reason: reuses Q051 notions of hard search versus easy verification to analyse governance processes and voting rules.

* Q120 (`BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_COMP_L3_120`)
  Reason: applies P versus NP tension to questions about whether alignment verification can remain efficient when the space of possible model behaviors grows super polynomially.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays at the effective layer.
We describe only state spaces, observables, invariants, tension scores, singular sets, and admissible encodings.

We do not describe any deep TU generative rule or any mapping from raw empirical data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a discrete semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation.

Each element `m` in `M` represents an abstract configuration that collects:

* a finite library of decision problem families,
* a finite library of algorithm families,
* a discrete resource scale for runtime and verification cost,
* a record of how these problems and algorithms perform on bounded input sizes.

We do not explain how such configurations are constructed from proofs, programs, or experiments.
At the effective layer we only assume that for each configuration `m` the following information is well defined.

1. A finite set `F_m` of problem families. Each family is a sequence of decision problems indexed by input length `n`.

2. A finite set `A_m` of algorithm families. Each family is a sequence of algorithms or circuits intended to solve some of the problems in `F_m`.

3. For each pair `(f, a)` with `f` in `F_m` and `a` in `A_m`, there is a record of observed or postulated behavior for input sizes up to some bound `N_max(m)`.

The state space `M` is discrete.
We only require that for each `m` these libraries and records exist and are finite.

### 3.2 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

All encodings in this document belong to a single admissible encoding class identified by

```txt
Encoding_key: ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1
```

An encoding with this key must satisfy all of the following conditions.

1. **Finite library condition**

   For each state `m` the sets `F_m` and `A_m` are finite.
   They cannot be extended by unbounded, case specific additions that depend on particular success or failure patterns inside the same state.

2. **Pre commitment of libraries**

   The choice of `F_m` and `A_m` for a state cannot depend on inspecting the detailed success or failure patterns of algorithms on those problems beyond a fixed design horizon that is specified before any experiment.

   Intuitively, one cannot keep adding new special purpose algorithms after seeing where earlier algorithms fail, while still claiming to measure a single configuration under this encoding key.

3. **Fair resource scale**

   For each state `m` there is a fixed monotone function

   ```txt
   R_m(n)
   ```

   that defines what counts as feasible time or space at input length `n`.
   Typical examples are bands such as “time at most `n^c` for some fixed `c`”.

   The function `R_m(n)` must be chosen from a finite, pre published family of resource profiles that is referenced in the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.
   It cannot be altered, widened, or weakened inside a state in response to particular hard instances.

4. **Uniformity across states**

   Problems and algorithms that are standard representatives for P, NP, and NP complete tasks must appear in many states in a way that does not depend on their detailed success or failure inside those states.
   Presence of such canonical benchmarks is determined by their mathematical definition, not by performance in any one experiment.

5. **No encoded answer to P versus NP**

   The admissible class does not allow encodings that presuppose an answer to P versus NP through design choices.
   In particular:

   * the resource family from which `R_m` is drawn may not distinguish worlds where `P = NP` from worlds where `P ≠ NP` by definition,
   * library construction rules may not exclude NP complete problems or special algorithms only in order to force a desired gap pattern.

Any encoding that violates these rules is not considered faithful and lies outside the scope of this page.

### 3.3 Effective observables

We introduce discrete observables on `M` that describe how hard or easy certain tasks appear under a given encoding.

1. **Solver success observable**

   ```txt
   Succ(m; f, a, n) in {0, 1, unknown}
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, problem family `f` in `F_m`, algorithm family `a` in `A_m`, and input length `n` up to `N_max(m)`.
   * Output:

     * `1` if `a` is known to solve all instances of `f` of length at most `n` within the allowed resource bound `R_m(n)`,
     * `0` if `a` is known to fail on at least one such instance within that bound,
     * `unknown` if the available information does not justify either label.

   The value `unknown` must not be treated as success or failure.
   Later observables must either exclude such points from averages or treat them by a conservative rule that is specified in advance.

2. **Verification cost observable**

   ```txt
   VerCost(m; f, n)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, problem family `f`, input length `n`.
   * Output: an effective cost scale that measures the minimum known resource needed to verify a claimed solution for instances of `f` of length `n`.

   The cost scale is measured relative to `R_m(n)` and must be derived from known algorithms or proofs, not from speculative claims.

3. **Search cost observable**

   ```txt
   SearchCost(m; f, n)
   ```

   * Input: state `m`, problem family `f`, input length `n`.
   * Output: an effective cost scale that measures the minimum known resource for finding a solution or deciding membership for instances of `f` of length `n` using algorithms in `A_m`.

For NP type problems in `F_m` the verification cost is expected to remain within the feasibility band defined by `R_m(n)` while search cost may or may not stay within that band.

### 3.4 Gap and tension observables

Using the observables above we define gap style quantities.

1. **Local verification feasibility indicator**

   ```txt
   VerFeasible(m; f, n) in {0, 1}
   ```

   This indicator is set to `1` if `VerCost(m; f, n)` is within the feasibility band of `R_m(n)`, and `0` otherwise.

2. **Local search feasibility indicator**

   ```txt
   SearchFeasible(m; f, n) in {0, 1}
   ```

   This indicator is set to `1` if `SearchCost(m; f, n)` is within the feasibility band, and `0` otherwise.

3. **Local gap observable**

   ```txt
   Gap(m; f, n) = VerFeasible(m; f, n) - SearchFeasible(m; f, n)
   ```

   Possible values:

   * `Gap(m; f, n) = 0` when search and verification are both feasible or both infeasible,
   * `Gap(m; f, n) = 1` when verification is feasible and search is not under the chosen scale,
   * `Gap(m; f, n) = -1` when search is feasible but verification is not.
     For NP and NP complete problems this last case should be rare under faithful encodings.

   Whenever `Succ(m; f, a, n)` is `unknown` for all algorithms `a` that might provide search or verification, the pair `(f, n)` must be handled by a rule chosen in advance.
   For example, it may be excluded from the sampling set defined below or treated as contributing a fixed neutral value to averages.
   The rule must not depend on which specific pairs turn out to be unknown in a given experiment.

4. **Sampling set and aggregate gap observable**

   For each state `m` we define a sampling set `S_m` and an aggregate gap

   ```txt
   GapAgg(m) = average over (f, n) in S_m of Gap(m; f, n)
   ```

   subject to the following constraints.

   * The sampling rule that determines `S_m` may depend on:

     * the encoding key,
     * the structure of the benchmark library,
     * input length ranges,
     * publicly declared distributions or weightings.
   * The rule must not depend on the observed success or failure patterns of algorithms within that state.
   * The handling of `unknown` entries for `Gap(m; f, n)` must be specified together with the sampling rule and recorded as part of the encoding description.

   These conditions prevent retrospective selection of easy or hard instances in order to force a desired gap.

5. **Aggregate mismatch scalar**

   We define

   ```txt
   DeltaS_PvNP(m) = max(0, GapAgg(m))
   ```

   This quantity is nonnegative.
   It reports the average excess of verification feasibility over search feasibility in the sampled region for state `m`.

### 3.5 Computational tension tensor and singular set

We encode Q051 as a computational tension problem using a discrete analogue of the TU tension tensor.

For each state `m` we assume the existence of

* source like factors `S_i(m)` that describe how strongly different agents, applications, or downstream systems depend on successful solution of problems in `F_m`,
* receptivity like factors `C_j(m)` that describe how sensitive those agents are to failures or delays on such problems.

Their detailed construction is not specified at the effective layer and must not alter `DeltaS_PvNP(m)`.

We define an effective tension tensor

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_PvNP(m) * lambda(m) * kappa
```

where

* `DeltaS_PvNP(m)` is the aggregate mismatch scalar defined above,
* `lambda(m)` is a discrete convergence state factor that summarises whether local reasoning about P versus NP is convergent, divergent, or unstable under the given encoding,
* `kappa` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of P versus NP related computational_tension for this encoding.

Some states may be ill defined for this encoding.
For example, `GapAgg(m)` may be undefined if `S_m` cannot be constructed fairly, if the resource scales are inconsistent, or if the handling of `unknown` entries cannot be applied consistently.

We define the singular set

```txt
S_sing = { m in M : DeltaS_PvNP(m) is undefined }
```

and the regular region

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All later statements refer only to states in `M_reg`.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

### 4.1 Core tension functional

The P versus NP tension functional is defined by

```txt
Tension_PvNP(m) = DeltaS_PvNP(m)
```

for `m` in `M_reg`.

Interpretation.

* If `P = NP` in the real world and the encoding is faithful in the sense of the disclaimer and Section 3.2, then it should be possible to construct sequences of states `m` that represent larger and larger input ranges with `GapAgg(m)` approaching `0`.
  In such sequences `Tension_PvNP(m)` becomes small.

* If `P ≠ NP` and some NP complete problems are genuinely hard, then in any faithful encoding `GapAgg(m)` should remain bounded away from `0` for states that reflect sufficiently large input sizes and representative benchmarks.
  In this case `Tension_PvNP(m)` remains large.

The precise thresholds depend on the sampling rule that defines `S_m` and on the resource profile used for `R_m(n)`.
Both belong to the admissible encoding class and must be fixed in advance for each encoding key.

### 4.2 P equals NP as low tension scenario

At the effective layer we express the hypothesis `P = NP` as the possibility of a low tension scenario.

Informal statement.

For some admissible encoding consistent with `Encoding_key: ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1`, and for every sufficiently large scale parameter `k`, there exists a state `m_k` in `M_reg` that encodes algorithms demonstrating that search and verification are both feasible on the sampled problems up to sizes controlled by `k`, with the aggregate gap close to `0`.

More explicitly.

1. There exists a refinement parameter `k` that indexes increasing ranges of input sizes and benchmark coverage.
2. For each `k` there is a state `m_k` with a sampling set `S_{m_k}` that covers problem families and input lengths up to a bound that grows with `k`.
3. The aggregate mismatch satisfies

   ```txt
   Tension_PvNP(m_k) = DeltaS_PvNP(m_k) <= epsilon_k
   ```

   where `epsilon_k` is a sequence of nonnegative numbers that tends to `0` as `k` increases.

In words, as the configurations cover larger and larger problem sizes in a faithful way, the observed average gap between search and verification feasibility becomes negligible.

This is a description of what a world with `P = NP` would look like inside this encoding.
It is not a claim that such a world is realised.

### 4.3 P differs from NP as persistent high tension scenario

If `P ≠ NP` and some NP complete problems inherently resist efficient algorithms, then for any admissible encoding we expect that the aggregate gap cannot be driven arbitrarily close to `0` as scale grows.

At the effective layer we express this as follows.

For every admissible encoding compatible with `Encoding_key: ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1` there exist constants `delta_star > 0` and `k_star` such that for all states `m` in `M_reg` that encode problem sizes and benchmarks beyond the scale indexed by `k_star` we have

```txt
Tension_PvNP(m) = DeltaS_PvNP(m) >= delta_star
```

In words, no matter how we refine the configuration while remaining faithful to the definitions of P and NP and to the encoding charters, once inputs reach sufficiently large sizes there remains a nontrivial aggregate gap between efficient verification and efficient search.

Q051, in this view, asks whether the real world and a faithful encoding realise a low tension scenario or a persistent high tension scenario for this gap.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer.
They are not models of full computation theory.
They are schematic patterns of observables and tension scores.

* World T: a world where `P = NP` and encodings can reach low tension.
* World F: a world where `P ≠ NP` and encodings must remain at high tension.

### 5.1 World T (P equals NP, low computational tension)

In World T the following patterns hold.

1. For every NP complete problem family `f` there exists an algorithm family `a` that decides `f` in polynomial time.
   This is reflected in states `m_T` where the search feasibility indicator satisfies

   ```txt
   SearchFeasible(m_T; f, n) = 1
   ```

   for all sampled `n` in the relevant range.

2. The aggregate gap observable satisfies

   ```txt
   GapAgg(m_T) is close to 0
   ```

   for refined states that cover large `n`.
   The tension functional `Tension_PvNP(m_T)` is small.

3. Verification feasibility remains high. For NP problems in the library we have

   ```txt
   VerFeasible(m_T; f, n) = 1
   ```

   throughout the sampled domain.

4. Downstream systems that rely on solving hard combinatorial problems can safely treat search tasks as broadly as feasible as verification tasks, at least in aggregate.

### 5.2 World F (P differs from NP, persistent computational tension)

In World F the following patterns hold.

1. There exist NP complete problem families `f_star` such that no algorithm family in any admissible encoding provides search feasibility for all large `n`.
   This is reflected by states `m_F` where, for many sampled `n` beyond some threshold,

   ```txt
   VerFeasible(m_F; f_star, n) = 1
   SearchFeasible(m_F; f_star, n) = 0
   ```

2. The aggregate gap observable satisfies

   ```txt
   GapAgg(m_F) >= delta_star
   ```

   for some positive `delta_star` that does not shrink when configurations are refined to cover larger `n`.

3. The tension functional does not admit a low band for representative states.

   ```txt
   Tension_PvNP(m_F) >= delta_star
   ```

4. Downstream systems must treat many NP type search tasks as fundamentally harder than verification tasks, even when verification remains efficient.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds are defined entirely at the level of observables, sampling rules, and tension scores.
They do not describe any procedure that constructs algorithms or proves complexity class equalities.

They only say that if such algorithms or proofs exist in a world then they produce patterns of gap and tension as described.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments at the effective layer that test the coherence and usefulness of the Q051 encoding.
They cannot solve P versus NP.
They can only falsify particular encodings or parameter choices that claim the key `ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1`.

All such experiments must log:

* the encoding key,
* the resource profile identifier,
* the definition of the sampling rule,
* a hash or version id for the benchmark suite,
* the raw observable data or sufficient summaries to allow external audit.

### Experiment 1: Benchmark based gap profiling

**Goal**

Test whether the Q051 tension functional matches current complexity beliefs across a fixed set of benchmark problems, without baking those beliefs into the definitions.

**Setup**

* Choose a benchmark suite `B` that includes:

  * problems believed to be in P,
  * problems believed to be NP complete,
  * problems of uncertain status.
* For a fixed encoding in the admissible class, define a library `F_m` that includes representative families for these benchmarks and a library `A_m` that includes standard algorithms and known heuristics.
* Fix a resource profile `R_m(n)` drawn from the finite family referenced in the encoding charters, for example a band up to `n^c` for some chosen `c` for time complexity.

**Protocol**

1. For each problem family `f` in `F_m` and each algorithm family `a` in `A_m`, estimate `Succ(m; f, a, n)` and the associated resource costs up to a feasible input size bound determined by `R_m` and available computing resources.
2. For each sampled pair `(f, n)` compute `VerFeasible(m; f, n)` and `SearchFeasible(m; f, n)` using the rules in Section 3.4, including the handling of `unknown`.
3. Construct the sampling set `S_m` using a rule that depends only on:

   * problem families,
   * input length ranges,
   * any declared distributions over instances.

   The rule must not depend on the observed success or failure patterns in this experiment.
4. Compute `GapAgg(m)` and `Tension_PvNP(m)`.

**Metrics**

* The fraction of believed P problems where the encoding produces `Gap(m; f, n)` close to `0` across most sampled sizes.
* The fraction of believed NP complete problems where the encoding produces positive gap on many sampled sizes.
* Stability of `GapAgg(m)` when:

  * the benchmark libraries are modestly extended,
  * new algorithms are added that respect the admissible class,
  * resource profiles are changed within the allowed finite family.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding produces large positive gap for standard believed P problems across many sampled sizes, the encoding is considered misaligned.
* If the encoding produces consistently zero gap for standard NP complete benchmarks across all sampled sizes, despite the lack of known polynomial time algorithms, the encoding is considered misaligned.
* If small and justified changes in benchmark selection or library composition cause `GapAgg(m)` to swing between very different values without explanation, this indicates instability and the encoding is rejected for this key.

**Semantics implementation note**

All observables are computed in a discrete model of computation consistent with the metadata semantics.
There is no continuous approximation in this block.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding or rejecting `ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1` under this experiment does not solve P versus NP.
It only shows that this particular gap and tension definition is not an adequate effective layer encoding.

---

### Experiment 2: Synthetic oracle world comparison

**Goal**

Use relativized or oracle worlds where P versus NP analogues are known to differ or coincide, in order to test whether the encoding correctly reflects such differences in tension.

**Setup**

* Select oracle constructions where:

  * in one world `P^O = NP^O`,
  * in another world `P^O ≠ NP^O`.

  Only oracle models described in standard textbooks or peer reviewed articles may be used, and each choice must be cited and versioned.

* For each oracle world define an effective library of problems and algorithms and a resource profile consistent with that oracle model and the encoding charters.

**Protocol**

1. For an oracle world where `P^O = NP^O`, construct a state `m_T_oracle` that reflects algorithmic capabilities in that world.
   Compute `Tension_PvNP(m_T_oracle)` by the same Q051 rules, with problem families and algorithms interpreted inside the oracle model.
2. For an oracle world where `P^O ≠ NP^O`, construct a state `m_F_oracle` and compute `Tension_PvNP(m_F_oracle)` in the same way.
3. Compare the tension values and patterns between the two worlds, using identical rules for sampling, gap computation, and handling of `unknown`.

**Metrics**

* Relative size of `Tension_PvNP(m_T_oracle)` and `Tension_PvNP(m_F_oracle)`.
* Robustness of this relation under small changes in encoding details that do not break admissibility, such as modest variations in benchmark choices that remain faithful to the oracle literature.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding assigns higher tension to the oracle world where `P^O = NP^O` than to a world where `P^O ≠ NP^O`, in a stable and persistent way, then the encoding is misaligned and should be rejected for this key.
* If the encoding cannot separate the two types of oracle worlds at all, and both always produce very similar aggregate gaps under reasonable settings, the encoding is considered too weak for Q051.

**Semantics implementation note**

The oracle worlds are treated as discrete computational models with extended access operations.
They must still fit inside the discrete semantics declared in the metadata.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying TU encoding or rejecting this encoding key in oracle experiments does not resolve the real P versus NP question.
These experiments only probe whether the encoding respects known model relative facts.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block explains how Q051 components can be used to shape AI behavior in the WFGY framework, while staying within the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We list several training signals that can be derived from Q051 observables.

1. `signal_search_vs_verify_gap`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to `Gap(m; f, n)` accumulated over tasks that resemble NP style problems.
   * Purpose: encourage internal representations where the model is aware that some tasks admit easy verification but may require heavy search.

2. `signal_feasible_reduction_respect`

   * Definition: a penalty for proposals that treat arbitrarily many problems as reducible to a single known easy problem when this contradicts known NP completeness structure.
   * Purpose: discourage the model from implicitly assuming `P = NP` in contexts where this assumption is not supported.

3. `signal_complexity_consistency`

   * Definition: a measure of how consistent the model is when it assigns complexity labels such as “easy”, “moderate”, or “hard” across logically related tasks.
   * Purpose: align the model’s informal hardness judgments with a discrete tension pattern inspired by Q051.

4. `signal_plausible_algorithmic_gap`

   * Definition: a signal that rewards explanations or plans that acknowledge a search versus verification gap in realistic problem families when this gap is part of the background assumptions.
   * Purpose: push the model away from overly optimistic algorithm proposals for problems believed to be NP complete.

These signals do not assume any particular answer to P versus NP.
They only try to keep the model’s behavior compatible with the effective layer gap encoding and with current mathematical knowledge.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We sketch module patterns that reuse Q051 elements.

1. `ComplexityAwarePlanner`

   * Role: planning module that, given a problem description, estimates a coarse complexity level and uses this estimate to choose between:

     * direct exact algorithm design,
     * approximate or heuristic methods,
     * explicit acknowledgement that a proposed exact algorithm would require breakthrough progress.
   * Interface: input is a structured description of a task, output is a complexity level and a plan type decision.

2. `VerificationFirstReasoner`

   * Role: reasoning module that prefers chains of reasoning whose intermediate steps can be checked with low resource cost, reflecting the relative ease of verification for NP tasks.
   * Interface: takes candidate reasoning steps and returns filtered variants that maximise verifiability under resource constraints.

3. `ReductionMapExplorer`

   * Role: module that tries to map new tasks to known hard problems while tracking when such reductions, if successful, would dramatically increase computational tension under the Q051 encoding.
   * Interface: input is a description of a new task, output is a list of candidate reductions and their implied contributions to `DeltaS_PvNP`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We outline a harness for evaluating AI systems that use Q051 modules.

1. **Task set**

   * Select decision problems that range from obviously easy to believed NP complete, including:

     * trivial membership tests,
     * path finding,
     * satisfiability,
     * simple graph problems such as clique and vertex cover.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline: AI system without explicit Q051 inspired modules.
   * TU enhanced: AI system with `ComplexityAwarePlanner` and `VerificationFirstReasoner` active and with the training signals described above.

3. **Metrics**

   * Accuracy on classification of task hardness into broad levels.
   * Quality of suggested algorithms or solution strategies, as judged by domain experts.
   * Rate at which the system proposes unrealistic efficient algorithms for tasks widely believed to be NP complete.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

This protocol allows external users to experience the effect of Q051 encoding in an AI system without access to internal details.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt the AI with:
    “Explain in simple terms what the P versus NP problem is and why it matters.”
    Observe whether the answer clearly distinguishes between search and verification and whether it captures the practical implications.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt the AI with:
    “Using the idea that some problems are easy to verify but possibly hard to solve, explain the P versus NP problem and describe how this tension affects cryptography and algorithm design.”
    Internally, the system is instructed to use Q051 style tension notions to structure the answer.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Rate both answers on clarity, explicit mention of the search versus verification gap, and connection to real applications.

* **What to log**

  * Prompts, full responses, and any Q051 related tension estimates that the system can expose without revealing deep TU internals.
  * These logs allow later analysis of whether the effective layer encoding improves the explanation quality.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. **ComponentName: `SearchVerifyGapFunctional`**

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: summaries of discrete problem families, algorithms, and a resource profile,
     * Output: an aggregate gap measure between search feasibility and verification feasibility.
   * Preconditions: the summaries must include feasibility indicators and a consistent resource band derived from a pre published profile.

2. **ComponentName: `DiscreteComplexitySampler`**

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a library of tasks and algorithms plus a sampling rule over input sizes,
     * Output: sampled pairs `(f, n)` together with feasibility indicators and gap values.
   * Preconditions: the sampling rule must be defined independently of observed success or failure data in any single experiment.

3. **ComponentName: `OracleWorldComparator`**

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: descriptions of two computational models that differ by oracle access or by restricted axioms,
     * Output: an experiment design that compares their induced P versus NP tension under the same encoding rules.
   * Preconditions: both models must be interpretable inside the discrete TU setting and must be referenced to a specific oracle or axiom scheme in the literature.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. **Q052 (Average case P versus NP)**

   * Reused components: `SearchVerifyGapFunctional`, `DiscreteComplexitySampler`.
   * Reason: average case hardness questions require similar gap measures but over input distributions instead of worst case sizes.
   * Changes: sampling incorporates distributions over inputs and output metrics include expected gap and variance over those distributions.

2. **Q055 (Cryptographic hardness)**

   * Reused components: `SearchVerifyGapFunctional`, `OracleWorldComparator`.
   * Reason: cryptographic security often relies on tasks that are easy to verify but believed hard to solve, possibly in hypothetical oracle worlds.
   * Changes: the focus shifts to concrete cryptographic primitives and their associated decision problems and success probabilities.

3. **Q123 (AI interpretability of algorithmic reasoning)**

   * Reused components: `SearchVerifyGapFunctional`.
   * Reason: interpretation of internal AI circuits can benefit from measuring gaps between internal verification like processes and search like processes.
   * Changes: the inputs are summaries of AI internal behaviours and resource usage rather than classical algorithms.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  The Q051 encoding defines a coherent discrete state space, observables for search and verification cost, a gap functional, and a tension functional.
  There are explicit experiments that can falsify particular encodings without claiming to solve P versus NP.

* **N_level: N1**

  The narrative expresses the P versus NP problem as a computational_tension question with a clear separation between low tension and high tension scenarios.
  It does not yet integrate more advanced refinements such as fine grained exponents or proof complexity details.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2 and E3

Toward **E2**:

* Implement a prototype that computes approximate `GapAgg(m)` and `Tension_PvNP(m)` for a public benchmark suite and publishes:

  * the benchmark definition,
  * the encoding key and resource profile id,
  * the sampling rule,
  * the raw or summarised observable data,
  * hashes or version ids for all artefacts.
* Verify that the encoding satisfies the falsification tests in Experiment 1 for that suite.
  If the tests fail, record that this encoding key is retired and document the reasons.

Toward **E3**:

* Extend the encoding to include fine grained resource scaling and more detailed sampling rules, possibly with multiple resource bands.
* Compare tension profiles between different hypothetical complexity hypotheses, for example worlds where common cryptographic assumptions fail or hold, within the constraints of the encoding charters.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term Q051 is expected to serve as:

* the reference node for complexity theoretic tension questions,
* a structural bridge between classical complexity theory and AI system design that respects search versus verification gaps,
* a test bed for linking discrete computational_tension with other tension types, such as incentive or cognitive tension, through cross domain problems.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block explains Q051 for non specialists, while staying faithful to the effective layer view and to the canonical definitions.

Many everyday tasks share a simple pattern.
It is easy to check whether a proposed answer is correct, but much harder to find such an answer from scratch.

For example, given a completed jigsaw puzzle you can quickly see that it is correct.
Given only the pile of pieces it can be much harder to assemble.
Many puzzles and computer tasks have this flavour.

In complexity theory class `P` collects problems that can be solved quickly by a computer.
Class `NP` collects problems where, if someone hands you a candidate solution, you can check it quickly.
Every problem in `P` is also in `NP` because you can solve it and then check your own answer.

The big question P versus NP asks is whether every problem that can be checked quickly can also be solved quickly.
No one knows the answer.

In the Tension Universe view we do not try to prove one side or the other inside this file.
Instead we measure how large the gap is between search and verification in a given configuration.

We imagine a collection of problems and algorithms and ask three questions.

1. For each problem, can we verify a proposed solution within a fixed resource budget.
2. For each problem, can we find a solution or decide membership within the same type of budget.
3. On average over a fair sample of problems and sizes, how often is verification easy while search is not.

That average gap becomes a tension score.
A low tension world behaves as if `P = NP`.
There is little difference between search and verification for the sampled tasks.
A high tension world behaves as if `P ≠ NP`.
Verification can be easy while search is often hard.

This does not solve P versus NP.
It does not tell us which world we live in.
It provides a precise way to describe what would be different between the two possibilities and a way to design experiments and AI systems that respect the search versus verification gap rather than ignoring it.

Q051 is therefore the main complexity theoretic node in the Tension Universe.
It encodes how the P versus NP question appears as a tension between search and verification at the effective layer, without claiming any proof or disproof of the underlying mathematical problem.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

### Scope of claims

* This page is part of the BlackHole S problem collection for the WFGY / Tension Universe program.
* It specifies an effective layer encoding and experiment patterns for the P versus NP problem.
  It does not claim to resolve the canonical problem.
* All complexity class definitions and canonical statements are taken from standard literature and are not altered here.
* Any tension values or experimental results derived from this encoding must be interpreted as properties of the encoding, not as proofs about the true relationship between `P` and `NP`.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here
  (state spaces `M`, observables, gap functionals, tension scores, counterfactual worlds)
  live at the TU effective layer.
* No deep TU generative rules or internal set theoretic constructions are exposed or relied on inside this document.
* Counterfactual worlds T and F describe possible patterns of observables and tension under different answers to P versus NP.
  They do not assert which world is realised.

### Encoding and fairness

* The encoding described here is identified by `Encoding_key: ENC_PVNP_DISCRETE_V1`.
* All libraries, resource profiles, and sampling rules must be chosen in advance and documented with this key.
  Any substantial change produces a new encoding key.
* Experiments that claim to use this encoding must publish sufficient information
  (benchmark definitions, resource profiles, sampling rules, and data summaries)
  to allow independent reconstruction and audit, in line with the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.

### Verification and updates

* If future experiments show that this encoding is unstable, misaligned with known complexity facts, or internally inconsistent, then this page should be treated as an archived specification of a retired encoding.
* Updating this page to a new encoding requires a new encoding key, a clear changelog, and consistent updates to all experiment descriptions that depend on it.

### Related charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
