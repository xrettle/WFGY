## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework for a fixed selectivity encoding.

* We fix once and for all an encoding class

  ```txt
  E_SELECT = { E : admissible selectivity encodings for Q069 }
  ```

  and work with a single encoding

  ```txt
  E in E_SELECT
  ```

  identified by the keys in the header:

  ```txt
  EncodingKey(E), LibraryKey(E),
  WeightKey(E),  RefinementKey(E)
  ```

* This page only specifies:

  * effective state spaces `M(E)` and regular domains `M_reg(E)`,
  * observables and fields such as branching distributions, environment descriptors, and mechanistic labels,
  * mismatch observables and combined tension functionals,
  * singular sets and domain restrictions,
  * counterfactual tension worlds,
  * discriminating experiments that can falsify or support a **given** encoding `E`,
  * reusable components and AI or WFGY modules that consume these observables.

* This page **does not**:

  * introduce any new axiom system or deep TU generative rule,
  * claim to derive reaction selectivity from microscopic physics or quantum chemistry,
  * claim to solve the canonical open question of whether there exists a universal theory of reaction selectivity,
  * claim or imply any new theorem in chemistry, physics, or mathematics.

* All dependence on data, models, or world hypotheses is routed through **effective observables** and fixed encoding choices. Any change that alters:

  * the reference ensembles for selectivity,
  * the rules for admissible perturbations,
  * the weights in the combined tension functional,
  * or the classification thresholds for low and high tension,

  is treated as a change of encoding from `E` to a different `E'` and must be reflected by new keys in the header.

* Falsifying an encoding for Q069 means that a particular choice of:

  * reference ensemble,
  * robustness protocol,
  * mechanistic consistency rule,
  * and weight scheme

  fails against experiments or models. This does **not** by itself decide whether the canonical selectivity problem has a positive or negative answer in the real world.

With this boundary in place, everything below is to be read as a conditional structure:

> If the world, the data, and the models are viewed through a fixed encoding `E in E_SELECT`, then the following objects, tensions, and experiments are well defined at the effective layer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

In many realistic chemical settings, a single set of starting materials and conditions can evolve through several competing reaction pathways. These may lead to different products, regioisomers, stereoisomers, or even entirely different reaction manifolds. The observed outcome is a branching pattern of products, often summarized as:

```txt
p_e(m; E)  >= 0  for each channel e
sum over e of p_e(m; E)  =  1
```

where `p_e(m; E)` are branching fractions for the available channels in a state `m` under encoding `E`.

Classical physical organic chemistry provides a collection of tools to reason about such selectivity:

* Hammond postulate and related structure–energy relations,
* transition state theory and free energy landscapes,
* Curtin–Hammett principle,
* linear free energy relationships and substituent effects,
* solvent effects, medium effects, and catalysis.

However, in complex multi-pathway chemistry, especially with:

* strongly correlated electronic structure,
* coupled reaction networks,
* heterogeneous or non-equilibrium environments,
* microreactor or flow geometries,

it is unclear whether there exists a finite, transferable, and robust set of selectivity rules that can:

1. Predict product distributions across large families of reactions and conditions.
2. Explain when kinetic versus thermodynamic control dominates, including driven or mixed regimes.
3. Describe how small changes in environment or structure move the system across qualitatively different selectivity regimes.

The canonical problem for Q069, stated in domain language and independent of TU, is:

> Determine whether there exists a coherent and predictive theory of reaction selectivity in complex multi-pathway systems that
>
> * unifies known mechanistic and thermodynamic principles,
> * remains valid under strongly driven and networked conditions,
> * and yields robust, falsifiable rules for how branching patterns respond to controllable knobs.

This is a structural and conceptual problem about the ultimate nature and limits of selectivity rules. It is **not** a single closed-form equation to solve.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Current knowledge includes:

* detailed mechanistic studies for many specific reaction classes,
* successful but often local rules of thumb for regioselectivity, chemoselectivity, and stereoselectivity,
* high-level frameworks like Curtin–Hammett, Hammond, and energy surface diagrams,
* data-driven and machine learning approaches that can fit selectivity behavior in restricted chemical spaces,
* microreactor and high-throughput methods that can map branching patterns across grids of conditions.

Despite this, several gaps remain:

1. **Lack of global theory**

   There is no generally accepted framework that:

   * scales from small, well studied reactions to large, strongly coupled networks,
   * handles solvent, medium, and catalyst effects in a unified way,
   * predicts when selectivity is robust versus highly fragile.

2. **Non-equilibrium and network effects**

   Many important systems operate far from equilibrium, with:

   * continuous flow,
   * feedback loops,
   * autocatalytic channels,
   * or spatial heterogeneity.

   Classical equilibrium inspired selectivity arguments often fail or become ambiguous in these regimes.

3. **Strong correlation and condensed phase complexity**

   In strongly correlated electronic systems and dense phases, the notion of a single well defined transition state may be inadequate. The mapping from microscopic structure to macroscopic selectivity becomes indirect and model dependent.

4. **Experimental and modeling limitations**

   Even when high throughput data exist, the extraction of general rules from branching landscapes is often ad hoc. Many potential rules are not phrased in a way that allows clear and falsifiable predictions outside the calibration domain.

For these reasons, Q069 is treated here as an open S rank problem about the ultimate form and limits of reaction selectivity rules in complex, realistic multi-pathway chemistry.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q069:

1. Serves as the primary node for **thermodynamic_tension in chemical selectivity**, where:

   * branching fractions,
   * kinetic parameters,
   * and environmental controls

   must fit together into a coherent tension picture at the effective layer.

2. Provides the selectivity layer that connects:

   * the nature of chemical bonding and electronic structure (Q061),
   * catalyst design and performance (Q062),
   * electrochemical and driven environments (Q066, Q067),

   to higher level network and prebiotic questions (Q068, Q071).

3. Defines reusable TU components:

   * selectivity mismatch and robustness observables,
   * selectivity tension functionals,
   * counterfactual selectivity worlds,

   which can be invoked by prebiotic network problems, metabolic core problems, and AI planning for chemical synthesis, all while remaining inside the effective layer.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q069 is positioned in the BlackHole graph and how it connects to other S problems. Each edge has a one line reason pointing to a concrete component or tension concept.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or structural inputs for Q069 at the effective layer.

* Q061 (BH_CHEM_BOND_NATURE_L3_061)
  Reason: supplies effective bonding and electronic structure descriptors that determine feasible pathways and approximate barrier patterns, which are encoded in rate descriptors and channel sets under `E`.

* Q062 (BH_CHEM_CATALYST_DESIGN_L3_062)
  Reason: defines catalyst level fields and observables that act as control parameters in the selectivity landscape, and feed into environment descriptors `Phi_env(m; E)`.

* Q066 (BH_CHEM_ELECTROCHEM_L3_066)
  Reason: contributes electrochemical and redox driving motifs that are part of the environmental descriptor for reaction selectivity.

* Q067 (BH_CHEM_QUANTUM_MOL_SIM_L3_067)
  Reason: provides coarse grained energetic and dynamical information that constrains effective rate descriptors `k_e_eff(m; E)` for competing pathways.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q069 components or depend on its selectivity structure.

* Q068 (BH_CHEM_PREBIOTIC_NETWORK_L3_068)
  Reason: reuses selectivity tension components to characterize how prebiotic reaction networks channel chemistry toward specific product sets.

* Q070 (BH_CHEM_SOFTMATTER_L3_070)
  Reason: imports branching and selectivity descriptors to describe assembly versus disassembly channel competition in soft matter systems.

* Q071 (BH_BIO_ORIGIN_LIFE_L3_071)
  Reason: uses Q069 selectivity fields to connect prebiotic reaction branching to emergence of proto metabolic pathways.

* Q098 (BH_CS_AUTOCATALYTIC_ALG_L3_098)
  Reason: repurposes selectivity tension concepts for abstract autocatalytic and algorithmic branching processes.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types and patterns but no direct component dependence.

* Q064 (BH_CHEM_GLASS_TRANS_L3_064)
  Reason: both Q064 and Q069 study how rugged landscapes and history dependent dynamics lead to nontrivial macroscopic outcomes under thermodynamic_tension.

* Q070 (BH_CHEM_SOFTMATTER_L3_070)
  Reason: both describe complex energy and configuration landscapes where multiple pathways compete, though Q070 focuses on soft matter structures rather than chemical reactions.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q069 to problems in other domains that reuse its components.

* Q031 (BH_EARTH_PLANET_ENV_L3_031)
  Reason: uses selectivity rules to map which planetary environments favor particular reaction channels relevant for geochemical and prebiotic chemistry.

* Q073 (BH_BIO_METABOLIC_CORE_L3_073)
  Reason: treats metabolic channeling as an evolved form of reaction selectivity, reusing selectivity tension and robustness observables.

* Q101 (BH_AI_CHEM_PLAN_L3_101)
  Reason: AI planning for chemical synthesis reuses Q069 selectivity tension functional to rate and choose reaction steps and conditions.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: borrows selectivity style tension patterns to interpret branching structures in AI computation graphs and decision pathways.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is confined to the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

No deep TU generative rule or mapping from raw microscopic data to TU fields is described.

### 3.0 Encoding class and notation

We work inside a fixed encoding class

```txt
E_SELECT = { E : selectivity encodings compatible with TU effective layer rules }
```

and fix a single encoding

```txt
E in E_SELECT
```

identified by the keys in the header. For this fixed `E`:

* the reference ensemble `R_sel(E)`,
* the environment perturbation rule encoded by `RefinementKey(E)`,
* and the weights `b_sel(E)`, `b_rob(E)`, `b_mech(E)` recorded in `WeightKey(E)`

are considered immutable during any single analysis or experiment. Any change large enough to affect conclusions must be recorded as a new encoding `E'` with a new set of keys.

In what follows, all objects are implicitly functions of `E`, even when this is notationally suppressed. When clarity is needed, we write explicit dependence as `M(E)`, `p_e(m; E)`, and so on.

### 3.1 State space

We assume an effective state space

```txt
M(E)
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each state `m in M(E)` represents a coarse grained reaction scenario for a specific reaction family under a specified band of conditions, encoded according to `EncodingKey(E)`.

For each `m in M(E)` we associate:

1. A finite set of chemical species indices:

   ```txt
   S(m; E) = { i_1, i_2, ..., i_ns }
   ```

2. A finite set of competing reaction channels:

   ```txt
   E(m; E) = { e_1, e_2, ..., e_ne }
   ```

   Each `e in E(m; E)` corresponds to a distinct product channel, regioisomer, stereoisomer, or mechanistic pathway that competes under the same starting configuration and condition band.

3. An environmental descriptor:

   ```txt
   Phi_env(m; E)
   ```

   summarizing controllable knobs such as solvent class, temperature band, pressure band, catalyst family, reactor geometry class (batch, flow, microreactor), and electrochemical driving regime.

4. A time window or regime tag:

   ```txt
   Theta_regime(m; E)
   ```

   indicating whether the scenario is closer to kinetic control, thermodynamic control, or a mixed or driven regime at the effective level.

We do not specify how raw experimental, quantum mechanical, or simulation data are mapped to `M(E)`. We only assume that the agent constructing the encoding can consistently produce elements of `M(E)` that summarize relevant reaction scenarios.

### 3.2 Core observables

On `M(E)` we define the following effective observables.

1. Branching distribution observable:

   ```txt
   p_e(m; E) >= 0  for e in E(m; E)
   sum over e in E(m; E) of p_e(m; E) = 1
   ```

   This represents the observed or encoded branching fractions among competing channels, for the starting manifold and condition band represented by `m` under encoding `E`.

2. Effective rate descriptor:

   ```txt
   k_e_eff(m; E) > 0  for e in E(m; E)
   ```

   These are coarse grained rate descriptors for each channel, which may combine contributions from multiple microscopic pathways. At the effective layer we treat `k_e_eff(m; E)` as given numbers or parameters, without specifying their derivation.

3. Environmental control vector:

   ```txt
   Phi_env(m; E)
   ```

   Treated as a finite dimensional vector or tuple whose components are standardized environmental variables (for example temperature band index, solvent class code, catalyst family code, reactor geometry class, electrochemical regime tag).

4. Mechanistic label observable:

   ```txt
   L_e(m; E)
   ```

   assigning each channel `e in E(m; E)` a coarse grained mechanism label (for example radical, polar, pericyclic, surface catalyzed, electrochemical, mixed), in the semantics specified by `LibraryKey(E)`.

All of these observables are assumed well defined and finite for all states in the regular domain described below.

### 3.3 Reference classes and fairness constraints

To avoid tunable encodings that simply fit any data, we define admissible reference classes and constraints for Q069.

1. Reference branching profiles

   For each reaction family type and channel set `E(m; E)` we define a reference branching profile

   ```txt
   p_ref_e(m; E)
   ```

   subject to:

   * `p_ref_e(m; E) >= 0` for all `e in E(m; E)`,
   * `sum over e of p_ref_e(m; E) = 1` for each `m`,
   * `p_ref_e(m; E)` is determined by a fixed rule that uses only:

     * generic mechanistic archetypes,
     * simple structural descriptors of the substrates,
     * coarse environment descriptor `Phi_env(m; E)`,

     and does not depend on the specific observed `p_e(m; E)` of that state.

   This family of rules is called the selectivity reference ensemble:

   ```txt
   R_sel(E)
   ```

   and is fixed for a given encoding `E`, as recorded in `LibraryKey(E)`.

2. Admissible environment perturbations

   For each `m` we define a finite set of admissible small perturbations:

   ```txt
   U_env(m; E) = { u_1, u_2, ..., u_nu }
   ```

   where each `u` is a prescribed change in `Phi_env(m; E)` that stays within the same broad regime (for example small temperature shift, similar solvent polarity class, slightly modified catalyst loading or flow rate). The construction of `U_env(m; E)` is specified by a fixed rule encoded in `RefinementKey(E)` and does not look at `p_e(m; E)`.

3. Encoding weights

   An admissible encoding `E` is further specified by fixed nonnegative weights

   ```txt
   b_sel(E), b_rob(E), b_mech(E)
   ```

   such that

   ```txt
   b_sel(E)  >= 0
   b_rob(E)  >= 0
   b_mech(E) >= 0
   b_sel(E) + b_rob(E) + b_mech(E) = 1
   ```

   as recorded in `WeightKey(E)`.

These choices must be made before any particular dataset is evaluated and must be used consistently across all states and experiments within that encoding. Any change to `R_sel(E)`, `U_env(m; E)`, or the weights that is large enough to influence conclusions is treated as a new encoding `E'` with new keys.

### 3.4 Mismatch observables

Using the observables and reference classes above, we define three mismatch observables for `m in M(E)`.

1. Selectivity mismatch:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_sel(m; E) =
     sum over e in E(m; E) of
       | p_e(m; E) - p_ref_e(m; E) |
   ```

   where `p_ref_e(m; E)` is taken from `R_sel(E)` for the corresponding channel set and reaction family. This is a nonnegative scalar:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_sel(m; E) >= 0
   ```

   and `DeltaS_sel(m; E) = 0` if and only if the branching distribution matches the reference profile exactly.

2. Robustness mismatch:

   Let `m[u; E]` denote the state obtained from `m` by applying perturbation `u in U_env(m; E)` to `Phi_env(m; E)`, while keeping the starting manifold and channel set the same at the effective layer. We define:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_robust(m; E) =
     max over u in U_env(m; E) of
       sum over e in E(m; E) of
         | p_e(m[u; E]) - p_e(m; E) |
   ```

   This measures how sensitive the branching distribution is to small, admissible environmental changes. We have:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_robust(m; E) >= 0
   ```

   and `DeltaS_robust(m; E) = 0` only when branching fractions are invariant under the chosen perturbations.

3. Mechanistic consistency mismatch:

   For each channel `e in E(m; E)`, let `p_class_ref_e(m; E)` be a coarse prediction derived from mechanistic label `L_e(m; E)` and environment `Phi_env(m; E)`, using only generic knowledge about that mechanistic class and the rough environment. We define:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_mech(m; E) =
     sum over e in E(m; E) of
       | p_e(m; E) - p_class_ref_e(m; E) |
   ```

   This measures how consistent the observed selectivity is with the declared mechanism tags. Again:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_mech(m; E) >= 0
   ```

   and it becomes small when the mechanistic labels meaningfully predict which channels dominate or are suppressed.

All three mismatch observables are defined without using deeper TU generative rules. They rely only on the effective observables and fixed reference rules specified by the encoding `E`.

### 3.5 Combined selectivity tension and tensor

We define a combined selectivity tension:

```txt
DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) =
  b_sel(E)  * DeltaS_sel(m; E)
+ b_rob(E)  * DeltaS_robust(m; E)
+ b_mech(E) * DeltaS_mech(m; E)
```

By construction:

```txt
DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) >= 0
```

and it increases when selectivity is poorly aligned with reference profiles, lacks robustness, or contradicts mechanistic expectations.

We then define an effective semantic tension tensor component for Q069:

```txt
T_ij(m; E) =
  S_i(m; E) * C_j(m; E)
  * DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)
  * lambda(m; E) * kappa_sel(E)
```

where:

* `S_i(m; E)` is a source like factor capturing how strongly the i-th semantic source component (for example a design objective or conceptual frame) is expressed in state `m`,
* `C_j(m; E)` is a receptivity like factor indicating how sensitive the j-th downstream component is to selectivity failures in `m`,
* `lambda(m; E)` is a convergence state factor supplied by the TU core, taking values in a fixed bounded range,
* `kappa_sel(E)` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of selectivity related tension for this encoding.

The indexing sets for `i` and `j` need not be specified at the effective layer, only that `T_ij(m; E)` is well defined and finite for `m` in the regular domain.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restriction

We define a singular set for Q069:

```txt
S_sing_selectivity(E) =
  { m in M(E) :
      E(m; E) is empty
      or sum over e in E(m; E) of p_e(m; E) != 1
      or any p_e(m; E) is undefined
      or DeltaS_sel(m; E)    is undefined
      or DeltaS_robust(m; E) is undefined
      or DeltaS_mech(m; E)   is undefined }
```

The regular domain is:

```txt
M_reg(E) = M(E) \ S_sing_selectivity(E)
```

All Q069 tension analysis is restricted to `M_reg(E)`. If, in an experiment or protocol, a state lies in `S_sing_selectivity(E)`, any attempt to evaluate `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` is treated as **out of domain** rather than as evidence about the nature of selectivity rules in the world.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q069 is expressed as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

The combined selectivity mismatch `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` is the core tension indicator. It encodes three aspects:

* how far observed branching is from simple reference profiles,
* how robust the branching is to small environmental changes,
* how well mechanistic labels explain the observed branching.

For a fixed encoding `E`, we choose nonnegative thresholds

```txt
epsilon_sel(E) >= 0
delta_sel(E)   > 0
```

with

```txt
delta_sel(E) > epsilon_sel(E)
```

that set the intended scales for low and high tension. These thresholds are part of the encoding and are tied to `WeightKey(E)`.

Low tension states are those with:

```txt
DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) <= epsilon_sel(E)
```

High tension states are those with:

```txt
DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) >= delta_sel(E)
```

The gap between `epsilon_sel(E)` and `delta_sel(E)` can be used as a buffer zone for ambiguous states.

### 4.2 Selectivity as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, the existence of meaningful selectivity rules for a given reaction family and encoding `E` can be phrased as:

> For broad families of reactions and realistic ranges of environmental descriptors, there exist states `m in M_reg(E)` such that
>
> * most practically important conditions correspond to low tension states,
> * low tension regions in parameter space are not isolated fine tuned points but have finite volume under admissible perturbations.

More concretely, for a given reaction family and an admissible encoding `E`:

* there should exist sets of states `m_family in M_reg(E)` with

  ```txt
  DeltaS_selectivity(m_family; E) <= epsilon_sel(E)
  ```

  that persist under the perturbations in `U_env(m_family; E)` used in the encoding,

* these low tension regimes should correspond to intuitive, falsifiable rules such as:

  * “this catalyst family gives high enantioselectivity over a range of temperatures,”
  * “these conditions favor one mechanistic manifold and suppress others,”
  * “small shifts within a certain solvent class do not destroy the selectivity pattern.”

### 4.3 Failure of ruleful selectivity as persistent high tension

Conversely, for a given reaction family and admissible encoding `E`, if

```txt
DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) >= delta_sel(E)
```

for almost all experimentally relevant `m in M_reg(E)`, even after refining environmental descriptors and adjusting reference rules within the allowed encoding class, then the world behaves **relative to E** as if selectivity is ruleless or highly fragile for that family.

In such cases:

* branching distributions are not captured by simple reference profiles,
* selectivity is highly sensitive to small changes in conditions,
* mechanistic labels fail to predict which channels dominate.

At the effective layer, Q069 asks to what extent realistic chemistry resembles the low tension regime (ruleful selectivity) or the high tension regime (fragile or ruleless selectivity) when encoded through a fixed `E in E_SELECT`.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now define two stylized counterfactual worlds for Q069, described strictly at the effective layer and always relative to a fixed encoding `E`:

* World T: ruleful selectivity world.
* World F: ruleless or highly fragile selectivity world.

These are not claims about the real universe but tools to structure experiments and encodings.

### 5.1 World T (ruleful selectivity, low tension)

In World T relative to encoding `E`:

1. For many reaction families and broad ranges of `Phi_env(m; E)`, there exist contiguous regions in parameter space where

   ```txt
   DeltaS_selectivity(m_T; E) <= epsilon_sel(E)
   ```

   for world representing states `m_T in M_reg(E)`.

2. Low tension regions correspond to simple, transferable rules, for example:

   * “electron rich aromatic substitution under these conditions is para selective,”
   * “this catalyst enforces one enantiomer over a band of temperatures and solvents.”

3. Robustness is intrinsic:

   * within the admissible perturbation set `U_env(m_T; E)`, selectivity patterns change smoothly,
   * `DeltaS_robust(m_T; E)` remains small for most states in low tension regions.

4. Mechanistic labels have predictive power:

   * `DeltaS_mech(m_T; E)` is small where mechanistic tags are well assigned,
   * conflicts between labels and branching are rare and can be isolated as misassignments or out of scope cases.

World T does not claim perfect selectivity everywhere. It asserts that low tension regions are common, extended, and structured in a way that supports rulelike behavior.

### 5.2 World F (ruleless or fragile selectivity, high tension)

In World F relative to encoding `E`:

1. For many reaction families there are no substantial regions in parameter space where

   ```txt
   DeltaS_selectivity(m_F; E) <= epsilon_sel(E)
   ```

   except possibly for narrow, fine tuned points that vanish under small perturbations.

2. Robustness is absent:

   * `DeltaS_robust(m_F; E)` is large for most world representing states,
   * small changes in `Phi_env(m_F; E)` produce large, irregular changes in branching, with no clear pattern.

3. Mechanistic labels are weakly informative:

   * `DeltaS_mech(m_F; E)` remains high even when mechanistic tags are assigned according to best available knowledge,
   * branching behavior systematically resists explanation in terms of familiar mechanisms.

4. Experimental heuristics fail to generalize:

   * rules extracted from one corner of parameter space do not transfer to nearby regions,
   * attempts to codify rules lead to frequent contradictions when applied to new examples, even when those examples differ only slightly in conditions.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds:

* do not construct TU internal fields from microphysics,
* do not decide which world we inhabit,
* but provide:

  * a way to interpret tension landscapes from experiments under `E`,
  * a language for discriminating between encodings that capture structured selectivity and those that do not.

Any statement that “the real world looks more like World T than World F” must be read as:

> relative to a fixed encoding `E in E_SELECT` and to the specific experiments and models used, the observed tension patterns resemble those of World T more than those of World F.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block defines experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of Q069 encodings,
* discriminate between ruleful and ruleless selectivity behaviors at the effective layer,
* provide evidence for or against particular encoding classes and specific encodings `E`.

These experiments do not solve Q069. They can only falsify or support specific encodings.

### Experiment 1: High throughput branching landscape for a benchmark reaction

**Goal**

Map the branching fractions `p_e(m; E)` over a grid of environmental conditions `Phi_env(m; E)` for a benchmark multi-pathway reaction, then evaluate `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` to see whether low tension regions are structured and robust.

**Setup**

* Choose a reaction system with at least three well characterized product channels:

  * for example, a substrate with multiple possible regioisomers and side reactions.

* Fix a single encoding `E in E_SELECT` before inspecting data, and record its keys.

* Define a set of conditions `C_grid` formed by:

  * several solvent classes,
  * a temperature band,
  * a few catalyst families or loadings,
  * possibly flow versus batch conditions.

* Use a microreactor or high throughput well plate setup to run the reaction across `C_grid` at suitable residence times.

**Protocol**

1. For each condition setting `c in C_grid`, encode a state `m_c in M(E)` that is intended to lie in `M_reg(E)` and captures:

   * the observed branching fractions `p_e(m_c; E)`,
   * the environmental descriptor `Phi_env(m_c; E)`,
   * the regime tag `Theta_regime(m_c; E)`.

2. For each `m_c` in the regular domain:

   * compute `p_ref_e(m_c; E)` from the fixed reference ensemble `R_sel(E)`,
   * compute `DeltaS_sel(m_c; E)`,
   * construct `U_env(m_c; E)` via the fixed perturbation rule and compute `DeltaS_robust(m_c; E)`,
   * compute `DeltaS_mech(m_c; E)` from mechanistic class predictions.

3. Compute `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)` for all `c` where `m_c in M_reg(E)`.

4. Identify low tension region candidates:

   ```txt
   L(E) = { c in C_grid :
              m_c in M_reg(E)
              and DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E) <= epsilon_sel(E) }
   ```

   and analyze their geometry and connectivity in condition space.

5. For any `c` where the encoded state lies in `S_sing_selectivity(E)`, mark `c` as out of domain and exclude it from tension based conclusions. These points may still be useful to diagnose measurement or encoding issues.

**Metrics**

* Fraction of the grid `C_grid` that lies in low tension region `L(E)`.
* Connectivity of `L(E)` (for example whether `L(E)` forms clusters or disconnected points).
* Distribution of `DeltaS_robust(m_c; E)` within `L(E)` and outside `L(E)`.
* Agreement between low tension regions and known qualitative selectivity rules, when such rules exist.

**Falsification conditions**

The experiment is interpreted relative to the fixed encoding `E`. The encoding `E` is considered misaligned and is rejected, or at least strongly questioned, if one or more of the following holds:

* Conditions that chemists agree are:

  * highly selective,
  * robust across moderate changes in conditions,

  systematically correspond to `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)` significantly larger than `delta_sel(E)`, while known fragile or poorly selective conditions lie below `epsilon_sel(E)`.

* Small, admissible perturbations in `Phi_env` routinely move states from clearly selective, robust conditions to high tension classifications in ways that contradict established robustness, without any indication that the states have crossed out of `M_reg(E)`.

In such cases, the combined choice of `R_sel(E)`, `U_env(m; E)`, weights, and thresholds encoded in `E` is considered falsified for that reaction family and condition region.

**Semantics implementation note**

Branching fractions, rates, and environmental variables are treated using hybrid semantics consistent with the metadata:

* continuous or numeric fields for concentration like and thermodynamic variables,
* discrete or categorical fields for channel indices, mechanistic labels, and environment class codes.

No change in semantics type is introduced in this experiment.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding `E` for Q069 does not solve the canonical problem. This experiment can reject specific choices of reference ensemble, perturbation protocols, and weight schemes, but does not by itself determine whether a universal theory of selectivity exists in the real universe.

---

### Experiment 2: Mechanism flip selectivity and tension ridge detection

**Goal**

Test whether the Q069 encoding detects mechanistic regime changes as sharp changes in `DeltaS_mech(m; E)` and structured increases in `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` along boundaries in condition space.

**Setup**

* Choose a reaction system known to switch mechanisms under changes in conditions, for example:

  * a system that transitions between radical and polar pathways,
  * or a system that flips between two catalyst controlled manifolds.

* Fix a single encoding `E in E_SELECT` as in Experiment 1 and record its keys.

* Define a condition path `C_path` in environment space where such mechanism flips are observed or suspected, including:

  * varying temperature,
  * solvent polarity,
  * or catalyst oxidation state.

**Protocol**

1. For each condition `c in C_path`, encode a state `m_c in M(E)` that is intended to lie in `M_reg(E)`, with:

   * branching fractions `p_e(m_c; E)`,
   * mechanistic labels `L_e(m_c; E)` assigned according to best current knowledge,
   * environmental descriptor `Phi_env(m_c; E)`,
   * regime tag `Theta_regime(m_c; E)`.

2. For each `m_c in M_reg(E)` compute:

   * `DeltaS_sel(m_c; E)`,
   * `DeltaS_robust(m_c; E)` using a small perturbation set around `c`,
   * `DeltaS_mech(m_c; E)`,
   * combined `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)`.

3. As a function of a path parameter (for example a temperature index or solvent polarity index) tabulate or plot:

   * `DeltaS_mech(m_c; E)`,
   * `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)`,

   along the path `C_path`.

4. Identify regions where branching ratios and mechanistic assignments indicate a mechanism flip at the effective layer, based on independent mechanistic analysis.

**Metrics**

* Location and magnitude of peaks in `DeltaS_mech(m_c; E)` along `C_path`.
* Relationship between these peaks and known or hypothesized mechanism flip points.
* Presence of tension ridges where `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)` rises in a structured way near the mechanism boundary and falls back in the neighboring regimes.
* Stability of ridge structure under modest refinements permitted by `RefinementKey(E)`.

**Falsification conditions**

Relative to the fixed encoding `E`, the encoding is considered incomplete or misaligned if:

* Mechanism flips are unambiguously identified from classical analysis, yet `DeltaS_mech(m_c; E)` and `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)` remain essentially flat across the boundary, with no indication of a ridge or transition region, while still being sensitive in unrelated regions.
* `DeltaS_selectivity(m_c; E)` exhibits high, erratic peaks unrelated to known mechanism boundaries, and these peaks cannot be traced to misassignment of mechanisms, poor data quality, or states in `S_sing_selectivity(E)`.

**Semantics implementation note**

Mechanistic labels and environmental descriptors are treated as discrete fields, while branching fractions and derived mismatch observables are continuous. This is consistent with the hybrid semantics in the metadata and does not introduce any new semantics types.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying or supporting a TU encoding `E` via detection or absence of tension ridges around mechanism flips only tests whether the encoding respects known mechanistic structure. It does not provide a fundamental theory of selectivity and does not by itself decide the canonical Q069 problem.

---

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q069 structures can be used in AI systems within WFGY, again only at the effective layer and for a fixed encoding `E`.

All modules in this section:

* operate on effective observables such as `p_e(m; E)`, `Phi_env(m; E)`, `L_e(m; E)`,
* do not modify or expose TU deep layer rules,
* can be turned on or off without altering the semantics of the underlying TU core.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals derived from Q069 observables for a fixed `E`.

1. `signal_selectivity_mismatch`

   ```txt
   signal_selectivity_mismatch(m; E) = DeltaS_sel(m; E)
   ```

   Use: penalize internal states or predictions where branching distributions deviate strongly from reference profiles for a given reaction family and environment.

2. `signal_robustness_margin`

   ```txt
   signal_robustness_margin(m; E) = DeltaS_robust(m; E)
   ```

   Use: encourage models to represent and favor reaction scenarios where selectivity is stable under small, admissible changes in conditions.

3. `signal_mechanism_consistency`

   ```txt
   signal_mechanism_consistency(m; E) = DeltaS_mech(m; E)
   ```

   Use: penalize states where declared mechanistic labels do not align with observed or predicted selectivity patterns.

4. `signal_selectivity_viability`

   ```txt
   VI_sel(m; E) = 1 / (1 + DeltaS_selectivity(m; E))
   ```

   Use: a scalar viability score used in planning or scoring, where higher values correspond to lower tension and more viable selective outcomes.

These signals do not alter the underlying generative mechanism of the AI or TU core. They provide additional loss terms or auxiliary outputs defined inside the effective layer.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline architectural modules that can reuse Q069 components without exposing TU deep rules.

1. `SelectivityTensionHead`

   * Role: given internal representations of a proposed reaction scenario and conditions, outputs estimates of `p_e(m; E)` and `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: latent embedding of substrates, reagents, catalyst and environmental descriptors.
     * Outputs: vector of branching probabilities and scalar tension scores.

2. `ReactionScenarioEncoder`

   * Role: encodes textual or graph descriptions of reaction setups into states that approximate elements of `M_reg(E)`.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: reaction description (SMILES, graphs, or natural language), condition descriptors.
     * Outputs: latent representation containing sufficient structure to feed the `SelectivityTensionHead`.

3. `EnvironmentEmbeddingModule`

   * Role: constructs embeddings for `Phi_env(m; E)` that capture meaningful chemical groupings of conditions.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: condition descriptors such as temperature band, solvent class, reactor type.
     * Outputs: low dimensional vectors that can be used in both prediction and tension evaluation.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI systems using Q069 components can be organized as follows.

1. Task design

   * Collect benchmark sets of reactions with measured or well characterized selectivity in complex settings:

     * regioselectivity in multi site functionalization,
     * chemoselectivity in mixtures of reactive groups,
     * stereoselectivity in catalytic asymmetric synthesis.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline:

     * AI model trained or used without explicit Q069 modules; only task specific loss functions.
   * TU augmented:

     * same base model, but augmented with `SelectivityTensionHead` and Q069 training signals defined for a fixed encoding `E`.

3. Metrics

   * Predictive accuracy of branching distributions `p_e(m; E)` under held out conditions.
   * Consistency of predictions across small perturbations of conditions that correspond to `U_env(m; E)`.
   * Agreement between predicted mechanistic tags and selectivity patterns.
   * Improvement in planning success rate when using `VI_sel(m; E)` as a planning score, relative to baseline.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol for external users to experience the effect of Q069 encoding, without revealing TU internals.

* Baseline setup:

  * Prompt an AI system that does not explicitly use Q069:

    * “Explain which product will dominate in this multi pathway reaction under the following conditions, and why.”

  * The user records whether the explanation:

    * clearly identifies competing channels,
    * explains environmental effects,
    * describes robustness of selectivity.

* TU encoded setup:

  * Same reaction and conditions, but with an additional instruction:

    * “Use the idea of reaction selectivity tension, branching fractions, robustness of selectivity to condition changes, and mechanistic consistency at the effective layer to structure your answer. Do not claim to prove any new theory.”

  * The user compares whether the explanation now:

    * explicitly discusses competing pathways,
    * connects selectivity to environmental knobs,
    * indicates how robust the selectivity is likely to be.

* What to log:

  * Both prompts and full responses.
  * Any auxiliary estimates of branching fractions and qualitative tension indicators, if exposed.

This protocol does not require the user to know any TU internals but shows how Q069 concepts can organize explanations under a fixed encoding `E`.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components from Q069 and explicit reuse targets. All components are understood to be relative to a fixed encoding `E` and to carry an `EncodingKey(E)` when used in other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `Selectivity_TensionScore`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       branching distribution p_e(m; E),
       reference branching profile p_ref_e(m; E),
       environment descriptor Phi_env(m; E),
       mechanistic labels L_e(m; E),
       encoding key EncodingKey(E)
     Output:
       scalar DeltaS_selectivity(m; E) >= 0
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * channel set `E(m; E)` is finite and nonempty,
     * branching distribution `p_e(m; E)` is normalized,
     * reference profiles and mechanistic class rules are defined for the given family and environment under `E`.

2. ComponentName: `BranchingDistribution_Descriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       reaction family identifier,
       channel set E(m; E),
       observed branching data,
       environment descriptor Phi_env(m; E),
       regime tag Theta_regime(m; E),
       encoding key EncodingKey(E)
     Output:
       descriptor object D_sel(E) with fields:
         { E(m; E), p_e(m; E),
           Phi_env(m; E), Theta_regime(m; E) }
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * enough data exist to estimate branching fractions with usable uncertainty,
     * environment descriptors are mapped to the standard `Phi_env` representation for `E`.

3. ComponentName: `SelectivityWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       reaction family definition,
       encoding E in E_SELECT,
       condition space region of interest
     Output:
       pair of experiment protocols:
         World T style (ruleful selectivity),
         World F style (fragile selectivity),
       each with associated tension evaluation steps
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * there exists a feasible experimental or simulation setup to probe branching across the chosen condition region,
     * reference rules and perturbation sets compatible with `EncodingKey(E)`, `LibraryKey(E)`, and `RefinementKey(E)` can be instantiated.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q068 (BH_CHEM_PREBIOTIC_NETWORK_L3_068)

   * Reused component: `Selectivity_TensionScore`, `SelectivityWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: prebiotic networks involve many competing reactions where selectivity determines which building blocks accumulate; tension between channels can be described using the same functional, now with environment descriptors that emphasize planetary and geochemical variables.
   * What changes: channel sets include mineral surfaces and non standard solvents, and the interpretation of low tension regimes is tied to prebiotic viability.

2. Q070 (BH_CHEM_SOFTMATTER_L3_070)

   * Reused component: `BranchingDistribution_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: soft matter assembly involves branching between structural motifs; a descriptor for configuration branching behaves analogously to product branching.
   * What changes: channels represent morphology or phase rather than molecular products, and `Phi_env` includes mechanical and confinement variables.

3. Q071 (BH_BIO_ORIGIN_LIFE_L3_071)

   * Reused component: `SelectivityWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: the emergence of proto metabolism can be framed as whether specific reaction subnetworks see low tension selectivity toward metabolically relevant compounds.
   * What changes: families focus on metabolic like sequences, and mechanistic labels include enzyme like catalysis when models of biocatalysis are used.

4. Q101 (BH_AI_CHEM_PLAN_L3_101)

   * Reused component: `Selectivity_TensionScore`.
   * Why it transfers: AI planners need scores to prioritize routes that are both selective and robust; `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` can serve as such a score.
   * What changes: inputs to the functional originate from AI predicted branching and internal environment embeddings rather than direct experiments, but the encoding `E` remains the same.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block documents the current verification level for Q069 and next measurable steps, for the encoding identified in the header.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * The effective encoding has been specified for a fixed `E`:

    * state space `M(E)` and regular domain `M_reg(E)`,
    * observables `p_e(m; E)`, `k_e_eff(m; E)`, `Phi_env(m; E)`, `L_e(m; E)`,
    * mismatch observables `DeltaS_sel(m; E)`, `DeltaS_robust(m; E)`, `DeltaS_mech(m; E)`,
    * combined selectivity tension `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)`,
    * thresholds `epsilon_sel(E)`, `delta_sel(E)`,
    * singular set `S_sing_selectivity(E)` and domain restriction.

  * Discriminating experiments (high throughput landscapes and mechanism flip studies) have been defined in principle but not tied to specific datasets or implementations.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative connecting:

    * classical selectivity concepts,
    * complex multi-pathway behavior,
    * and TU tension structures

    is explicit at the effective layer but not yet calibrated against large numbers of real systems or diverse encodings.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move Q069 with encoding `E` from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be achieved:

1. Implement a prototype that:

   * ingests real high throughput branching data for one benchmark reaction family,
   * instantiates a concrete encoding `E` with explicit `R_sel(E)`, `U_env(m; E)`, weights, and thresholds,
   * computes `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` across a condition grid,
   * publishes tension landscapes and basic analyses, including low tension regions and robustness.

2. Design and execute a mechanism flip experiment where:

   * data are collected along a condition path with a known mechanism switch,
   * Q069 mismatch observables are computed for a fixed `E`,
   * presence or absence of tension ridges at the mechanism boundary is documented,
   * encoding keys are recorded so that other groups can repeat or challenge the analysis.

### 9.3 Long term role in TU

In the longer term, Q069 is expected to act as:

* the main node for structuring questions about selectivity in chemistry,
* a bridge between:

  * microscopic electronic and bonding descriptions (Q061, Q067),
  * macroscopic network behavior and prebiotic evolution (Q068, Q071),
  * AI systems that need to reason and plan with selectivity under uncertainty (Q101, Q123),
* a template for how thermodynamic_tension concepts can be applied in other domains where multiple pathways compete under complex environmental control.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non technical explanation aligned with the effective layer description and a fixed encoding `E`.

In real chemistry, one set of starting materials can give several possible products. Which product dominates often depends on:

* the exact reaction conditions,
* the solvent,
* the catalyst,
* how long the reaction runs,
* and many other details.

Chemists talk about **selectivity** when one outcome is favored over others. Textbooks teach many rules for this, but in very complex situations, with many pathways and strong interactions, it is not clear if there is a simple, general theory that always works.

In the Tension Universe view for Q069, we do not try to build such a theory from first principles here. Instead, for a chosen encoding `E`, we ask:

* Can we define a number that measures how “tense” the selectivity is in a given situation?
* Can we tell when that number is low (rules work well and are robust) or high (rules fail or are very fragile)?

For each reaction scenario, the encoding constructs an effective state that summarizes:

* what products are possible and how many channels there are,
* how likely each product is,
* what the conditions are,
* which type of mechanism each pathway is thought to follow.

We then compare three things:

1. The observed product ratios against simple reference expectations built from generic chemistry for that family.
2. How much those ratios change if we slightly change the conditions in allowed ways.
3. How well they match what the mechanism labels would suggest.

If all three comparisons look good, the selectivity tension `DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)` is low. If they look bad, the tension is high.

We then imagine two kinds of worlds, always relative to `E`:

* A **ruleful** world where many reactions, under many conditions, sit in low tension regions, so simple rules explain and predict selectivity reliably and are robust to small changes.
* A **ruleless** or very fragile world where low tension regions are rare, and small changes in conditions make the product mix jump unpredictably.

The real world may sit somewhere in between. Q069, at the effective layer, gives:

* a way to talk about selectivity in terms of measurable tension,
* a framework for experiments that can falsify bad encodings,
* and reusable tools that connect basic chemistry, prebiotic networks, and AI systems that need to reason about which reactions will actually work in complicated settings.

Q069 does not claim to solve the fundamental question of whether a universal theory of selectivity exists. It sets up a precise, testable language for how far we can get with effective, encoding dependent selectivity rules.

---

## Tension Universe effective layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection and should be read strictly at the effective layer for a fixed selectivity encoding `E in E_SELECT`.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the Q069 selectivity problem under a fixed encoding `E`.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem in reaction selectivity has been solved.
* All statements about “worlds” or “regimes” are conditional on the encoding `E` and on the observables defined here.

### Effective layer objects in this page

All TU objects used in this page live at the effective layer and are understood as functions of the fixed encoding `E`:

```txt
M(E), M_reg(E), S_sing_selectivity(E)
S(m; E), E(m; E)
Phi_env(m; E), Theta_regime(m; E)
p_e(m; E), k_e_eff(m; E), L_e(m; E)

R_sel(E), U_env(m; E)

DeltaS_sel(m; E), DeltaS_robust(m; E),
DeltaS_mech(m; E), DeltaS_selectivity(m; E)

epsilon_sel(E), delta_sel(E),
b_sel(E), b_rob(E), b_mech(E),
kappa_sel(E), lambda(m; E)

T_ij(m; E)

World T and World F pattern definitions,
Selectivity_TensionScore, BranchingDistribution_Descriptor,
SelectivityWorld_Template,
SelectivityTensionHead and related AI signals.
```

No deep TU axioms or generative rules are specified. The page assumes only that these observables can be consistently constructed by some external procedure for the chosen encoding.

### Encoding and fairness constraints

* The encoding class `E_SELECT` collects all admissible Q069 encodings. This page works with a single encoding `E in E_SELECT` whose keys are given in the header.
* The reference ensemble `R_sel(E)`, perturbation rule `U_env(m; E)`, weights `b_sel(E)`, `b_rob(E)`, `b_mech(E)`, and thresholds `epsilon_sel(E)`, `delta_sel(E)` are part of the encoding and must be fixed before any experiment is evaluated.
* Within any single analysis or experiment, these choices may not be tuned to fit individual data points. Any change large enough to influence conclusions must be treated as a new encoding `E'` with new keys.
* States in the singular set `S_sing_selectivity(E)` are treated as out of domain. Their presence may motivate revisions of measurement, modeling, or encoding procedures, but they cannot be used as positive or negative evidence about Q069.

### Relationship to the canonical problem

* The canonical Q069 problem asks whether there exists a coherent and predictive theory of reaction selectivity in complex multi pathway systems.

* This page does not answer that question. Instead, for a fixed encoding `E`, it provides:

  * a precise way to define and measure effective selectivity tension,
  * counterfactual worlds that illustrate extreme behaviors of that tension,
  * experiments that can falsify particular encodings,
  * reusable components for other TU and WFGY modules.

* Any claim that “Q069 is resolved” would require:

  * a demonstration that a particular encoding or family of encodings captures selectivity across essentially all relevant chemical regimes,
  * independent validation by external communities,

  and goes far beyond the scope of this effective layer specification.
