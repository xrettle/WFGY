## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework:

* We only specify observables, tension indicators, functionals, extremality patterns, and testable predictions.
* We do not specify any underlying axiom system, generating rules, or constructive derivations of TU itself.
* We do not provide any explicit mapping from raw arithmetic or spectral data to internal TU fields; we only assume the existence of TU compatible models that reproduce the listed observables.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

Let `L(s, chi)` be a Dirichlet L-function attached to a Dirichlet character `chi` modulo `q`. For `Re(s) > 1` it admits the convergent series

```txt
L(s, chi) = sum_{n=1 to infinity} chi(n) / n^s
```

and it extends to a meromorphic function on the complex plane with at most a simple pole at `s = 1` in the principal character case.

The Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), in its standard Dirichlet form, states that:

> For every primitive Dirichlet character `chi`, all nontrivial zeros of `L(s, chi)` lie on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`.

More general versions extend this statement to broader classes of L-functions, for example:

* Hecke L-functions over number fields.
* Hasse–Weil L-functions associated with arithmetic varieties.
* Automorphic L-functions arising from automorphic representations.

In each case there is a critical strip and a conjectured critical line such that all nontrivial zeros are expected to lie on that line.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

GRH is open in all of its standard formulations. For Dirichlet L-functions we know:

* All nontrivial zeros lie in the critical strip `0 < Re(s) < 1`.
* Infinitely many zeros lie on the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2` for each primitive character, but not all.
* Zero-free regions near `Re(s) = 1` are known under various conditions and give strong results on primes in arithmetic progressions.
* Assuming GRH leads to significantly sharper error terms for the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions and many other arithmetic problems.

For more general L-functions the situation is even more delicate. GRH interacts with:

* Equidistribution results for arithmetic objects in residue classes or more general moduli.
* Bounds on character sums and exponential sums.
* Deep questions about the arithmetic of elliptic curves, motives and automorphic forms.

GRH is widely regarded as one of the central open problems in analytic number theory and arithmetic geometry.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q002 has three main roles.

1. It extends Q001 from a single zeta function to families of L-functions, so it becomes the prototype of a family-level spectral_tension problem.

2. It supplies the family-level spectral_tension structure that downstream problems reuse, including:

   * Q003 (Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer type problems).
   * Q015 (rank bounds and uniformity questions).
   * Q018 (fine statistics of zero correlations).
   * Q123 (family-level interpretability templates for AI models).

3. It tests whether the Tension Universe framework can encode a family of coupled spectra and arithmetic patterns in a way that:

   * remains purely at the effective layer,
   * obeys fairness constraints on encodings and weights,
   * and produces falsifiable tension functionals without claiming any proof of GRH.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q002 sits inside the BlackHole graph for Q001–Q125. Each edge has a one-line reason referring to concrete components or tension types.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites and structural tools that Q002 relies on at the effective layer.

* **Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L2_001, Riemann Hypothesis)**
  Reason: supplies the base spectral_tension encoding for a single L-function that Q002 generalizes to families.

* **Q016 (BH_MATH_ZFC_CH_L3_016, continuum and foundational structure)**
  Reason: provides foundational perspective on real number models and analytic_field structure underlying the continuous encoding used for L-functions.

* **Q019 (BH_MATH_DIOPH_DENSITY_L3_019, distribution of rational points)**
  Reason: encodes density and distribution tools that mirror how GRH consequences control primes in arithmetic progressions and more general arithmetic densities.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems reuse Q002 components directly or depend on the GRH family tension structure.

* **Q003 (BH_MATH_BSD_L3_003, Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture)**
  Reason: uses family spectral_tension modules to connect L-function zeros and special values to ranks of elliptic curves.

* **Q015 (BH_MATH_RANK_BOUNDS_L3_015, uniform rank bounds)**
  Reason: reuses GRH family tension indicators to frame constraints on global rank distributions.

* **Q018 (BH_MATH_RANDOM_MATRIX_ZEROS_L3_018, pair correlation and spacing)**
  Reason: depends on GRH compatible spectral_tension encodings for fine correlation studies across L-function families.

* **Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123, scalable interpretability)**
  Reason: borrows GRH family tension as a template for understanding family-level internal spectra inside AI models.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but do not depend on Q002 components.

* **Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L2_001, Riemann Hypothesis)**
  Reason: both Q001 and Q002 are spectral_tension problems where hidden spectral structure must match arithmetic observables through a tension functional.

* **Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036, high temperature superconductivity mechanism)**
  Reason: both study complex spectra which control macroscopic behavior through constraints expressible as low spectral_tension principles.

* **Q039 (BH_PHYS_QTURBULENCE_L3_039, quantum turbulence)**
  Reason: both involve nontrivial spectra and emergent laws that can be encoded as conditions on spectral_tension functionals.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q002 to problems that can reuse its family spectral_tension tools.

* **Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032, quantum thermodynamics foundations)**
  Reason: imports family spectral_tension aggregators to relate families of microscopic spectra to macroscopic thermodynamic observables.

* **Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040, black hole information problem)**
  Reason: reuses family tension interfaces to study how different spectral branches of a black hole model must cohere.

* **Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059, thermodynamic cost of information)**
  Reason: uses the concept of family-level tension between spectral or code properties and information-theoretic quantities.

* **Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121, AI alignment problem)**
  Reason: treats alignment as a constraint on many interacting subsystems, analogous to GRH constraints on many L-functions, and reuses family tension templates.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

This block encodes Q002 strictly at the effective layer. It defines:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* fairness and encoding locks.

It does not specify any TU deep generative rule or any mapping from raw numerical data to internal fields.

### 3.1 State space

We introduce a state space

```txt
M_GRH
```

with the following effective interpretation.

* Each state `m` in `M_GRH` represents a coherent configuration for a finite library of L-functions. It contains:

  * spectral summaries for each L-function in the library,
  * arithmetic summaries tied to those L-functions,
  * metadata about resolution and reliability.

* We do not describe how these summaries are obtained from raw computations or proofs. We only assume that such summaries can be encoded in states of `M_GRH`.

All observables defined below are only required to be well defined on a regular subset

```txt
M_GRH_reg ⊆ M_GRH
```

introduced in Section 3.9.

### 3.2 Encoding classes and freeze lock

To control fairness and avoid post hoc tuning, we specify a family of encoding classes indexed by a positive integer `k`:

```txt
E_GRH(k)
```

For each `k`, the class `E_GRH(k)` includes:

* a finite set of moduli `q` up to a bound `Q_max(k)`,
* for each modulus `q`, a finite set of primitive characters `chi`,
* for each pair `(q, chi)`, a finite collection of bounded regions `R` in the critical strip for `L(s, chi)`,
* for each pair `(q, chi)`, a finite collection of intervals `I` for arithmetic observables.

The E_GRH(k) freeze lock is:

1. The definition of `E_GRH(k)` (including `Q_max(k)`, the selection rule for characters, and the families of regions `R` and intervals `I`) must be fixed before inspecting any problem-specific spectral or arithmetic data for the functions included in `E_GRH(k)`.

2. Allowed information for deciding `E_GRH(k)`:

   * combinatorial information such as:

     * the list of moduli `q` and number of primitive characters per modulus,
     * which characters are primitive or induced,

   * public metadata such as:

     * whether tables exist up to a given height,
     * coarse tabulation limits published in standard references.

3. Explicitly forbidden for deciding `E_GRH(k)`:

   * any use of zero locations, zero density statistics, pair-correlation data, or higher-order spectral summaries,
   * any use of prime-counting error statistics, character sums, or other arithmetic deviations computed from the data that `M_GRH` is supposed to encode.

The zeta case from Q001 appears as the special case where `q = 1` and there is a single trivial character, with a corresponding one-function encoding class.

### 3.3 Effective fields and observables

On `M_GRH` we define the following effective observables.

1. Local zero density per character

```txt
rho_zero_chi(m; R, chi) ≥ 0
```

* Input: state `m`, region `R` from the critical strip for the L-function associated with `chi`.
* Output: a scalar summarizing the density or intensity of nontrivial zeros in `R` for that character.

2. Local arithmetic profile per character

```txt
A_prime_chi(m; I, chi)
```

* Input: state `m`, interval `I` of positive real numbers, and character `chi`.
* Output: a finite-dimensional descriptor summarizing prime or character-sum statistics on `I` that are relevant for GRH consequences.

3. Spectral mismatch per character

```txt
DeltaS_spec_chi(m; R, chi) ≥ 0
```

* Measures the deviation of `rho_zero_chi(m; R, chi)` from a reference profile predicted by GRH-compatible models for that character and region.
* The reference profile is chosen from a finite admissible reference library defined in Section 3.5 and does not depend on the specific data in `m`.

4. Arithmetic mismatch per character

```txt
DeltaS_arith_chi(m; I, chi) ≥ 0
```

* Measures the deviation of `A_prime_chi(m; I, chi)` from a GRH-compatible reference profile for primes or related arithmetic quantities twisted by `chi`.
* The reference profile belongs to a finite admissible library fixed in advance and not tuned to match the particular data in `m`.

These observables are defined for all `m` in `M_GRH_reg` and for all `R, I, chi` belonging to an encoding class `E_GRH(k)`.

### 3.4 Metric lock and normalization

All mismatch terms are treated as dimensionless, normalized quantities.

The metric lock for Q002 is:

1. For each `(R, chi)` we construct a normalized feature vector

   ```txt
   v_spec(m; R, chi)
   ```

   summarizing the local zero statistics, for example via a fixed binning and normalization rule.

2. For each `(I, chi)` we construct a normalized feature vector

   ```txt
   v_arith(m; I, chi)
   ```

   summarizing prime or character-sum deviations in that interval.

3. We choose a fixed Euclidean (L2) metric on these feature spaces and define:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_spec_chi(m; R, chi) = || v_spec(m; R, chi) - v_spec_ref(R, chi) ||_2

   DeltaS_arith_chi(m; I, chi) = || v_arith(m; I, chi) - v_arith_ref(I, chi) ||_2
   ```

   where `v_spec_ref` and `v_arith_ref` are fixed reference vectors drawn from the reference libraries defined in Section 3.5.

4. All normalization rules used to build `v_spec` and `v_arith` (binning, scaling, weighting across bins) are fixed at the charter level, not tuned per problem.

This ensures that all `DeltaS_*` are dimensionless and comparable across regions, intervals and encoding classes.

### 3.5 Reference profile libraries and lock

We specify two finite reference libraries:

```txt
Ref_spec_library_GRH   = { ref_spec_1, ref_spec_2, ..., ref_spec_M }
Ref_arith_library_GRH  = { ref_arith_1, ref_arith_2, ..., ref_arith_N }
```

Each element comes with an identifier and version tag, and is derived from:

* analytically motivated baselines such as Riemann–von Mangoldt density formulas and random-matrix predictions,
* published bounds and error envelopes for primes in arithmetic progressions and related objects.

The reference library lock is:

1. For each admissible `(R, chi)` we choose `v_spec_ref(R, chi)` by selecting one element from `Ref_spec_library_GRH` and applying a fixed, rule-based transformation that may depend on `(q, chi, R)` only through public structural parameters (such as level, conductor, height range), never through observed deviations.

2. For each `(I, chi)` we choose `v_arith_ref(I, chi)` by selecting one element from `Ref_arith_library_GRH` and applying an analogous fixed transformation.

3. The choice maps

   ```txt
   (R, chi) ↦ v_spec_ref(R, chi)
   (I, chi) ↦ v_arith_ref(I, chi)
   ```

   are specified at the charter level and are independent of the observed data and of the unknown truth value of GRH.

Changing the reference libraries or these maps corresponds to defining a new version of the Q002 encoding and must go through the TU charters, not through local edits of this file.

### 3.6 Aggregated GRH mismatch and aggregator lock

For each encoding class `E_GRH(k)` we define index sets:

* `F_spec(k)`: finite set of tuples `(R, chi, q)` in `E_GRH(k)` used for spectral analysis.
* `F_arith(k)`: finite set of tuples `(I, chi, q)` in `E_GRH(k)` used for arithmetic analysis.

We first define mean mismatches:

```txt
DeltaS_GRH_spec_mean(m; k) =
  (1 / |F_spec(k)|) * sum_{(R, chi, q) in F_spec(k)} DeltaS_spec_chi(m; R, chi)

DeltaS_GRH_arith_mean(m; k) =
  (1 / |F_arith(k)|) * sum_{(I, chi, q) in F_arith(k)} DeltaS_arith_chi(m; I, chi)
```

To avoid dilution of small families of high-tension outliers, we also define top M statistics. Fix once and for all an integer

```txt
M_top_GRH = 5
```

and let `Top_M_spec(k)` be the set of `M_top_GRH` largest `DeltaS_spec_chi` values in `F_spec(k)` (or all of them if `|F_spec(k)| < M_top_GRH`), similarly for `Top_M_arith(k)`.

Define:

```txt
DeltaS_GRH_spec_top(m; k) =
  (1 / |Top_M_spec(k)|) * sum_{(R, chi, q) in Top_M_spec(k)} DeltaS_spec_chi(m; R, chi)

DeltaS_GRH_arith_top(m; k) =
  (1 / |Top_M_arith(k)|) * sum_{(I, chi, q) in Top_M_arith(k)} DeltaS_arith_chi(m; I, chi)
```

We then fix a mixing parameter

```txt
gamma_GRH in (0, 1)
```

as part of the encoding (for example `gamma_GRH = 0.5`) and define the aggregated mismatches:

```txt
DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k) =
  (1 - gamma_GRH) * DeltaS_GRH_spec_mean(m; k)
  + gamma_GRH   * DeltaS_GRH_spec_top(m; k)

DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k) =
  (1 - gamma_GRH) * DeltaS_GRH_arith_mean(m; k)
  + gamma_GRH   * DeltaS_GRH_arith_top(m; k)
```

The aggregator lock is: the values of `M_top_GRH` and `gamma_GRH`, and the decision to use this mean plus top M structure, are frozen at the charter level and do not depend on data. Any different aggregator defines a different encoding version.

### 3.7 Effective tension tensor

We assume an effective tension tensor over `M_GRH`, consistent with the TU core pattern:

```txt
T_ij_GRH(m; k) =
  S_i(m; k) * C_j(m; k) * DeltaS_GRH(m; k) * lambda(m; k) * kappa_GRH
```

where:

* `S_i(m; k)` is a source factor for the ith semantic source component, capturing how strongly that component depends on GRH-compatible structure at level `k`.

* `C_j(m; k)` is a receptivity factor for the jth downstream component, measuring its sensitivity to GRH-related mismatches.

* `DeltaS_GRH(m; k)` is the combined family-level mismatch defined by:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_GRH(m; k) =
    w_spec * DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k) +
    w_arith * DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k)
  ```

  with `(w_spec, w_arith)` fixed positive weights satisfying `w_spec + w_arith = 1`.

* `lambda(m; k)` is the convergence-state factor from the TU core.

* `kappa_GRH` is a coupling constant for Q002 that sets the overall scale of GRH spectral_tension.

The weights `(w_spec, w_arith)` and `kappa_GRH` are part of the encoding and do not depend on the state `m` or on observed data. All of `S_i`, `C_j`, `lambda` and `kappa_GRH` are treated as effective observables or control fields at this level. This file does not expose any underlying TU generative rule or axiom that might produce them.

### 3.8 Family-level invariants and constraints

We define family invariants:

```txt
I_family_spec(m; k)   = DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k)
I_family_arith(m; k)  = DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k)
I_family_total(m; k)  = DeltaS_GRH(m; k)
```

These must remain finite and reasonably stable across increasing `k` for encodings that are considered viable. Instability or divergence of these invariants under small changes of encoding within the admissible charter range is treated as evidence against the encoding, not against GRH itself.

### 3.9 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some states may have incomplete or inconsistent data. To keep the encoding meaningful we define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing_GRH =
  { m in M_GRH :
      DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k) or DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k)
      is undefined or not finite for some admissible k }
```

We then restrict Q002 analysis to the regular domain:

```txt
M_GRH_reg = M_GRH \ S_sing_GRH
```

Any attempt to evaluate GRH-related invariants on states in `S_sing_GRH` is treated as out of domain. It is not counted as evidence for or against GRH, only as a signal that the encoding for that state is not valid.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block encodes GRH as a tension principle at the effective layer. It does not claim any proof or disproof.

### 4.1 Core GRH tension functional

For each `k` we define:

```txt
Tension_GRH(m; k) =
  alpha_GRH * DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k) +
  beta_GRH  * DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k)
```

where:

* `alpha_GRH > 0` and `beta_GRH > 0` are fixed constants reflecting the relative emphasis on spectral and arithmetic mismatch,
* they are part of the encoding and do not depend on `m` or on observed data.

This functional satisfies:

* `Tension_GRH(m; k) ≥ 0` for all `m` in `M_GRH_reg`,
* `Tension_GRH(m; k)` is small when both aggregated mismatches are small,
* `Tension_GRH(m; k)` becomes large when a nontrivial portion of the family has large spectral or arithmetic mismatch.

### 4.2 GRH as a low-tension family principle

At the effective layer the GRH statement becomes:

> For every admissible encoding class `E_GRH(k)` that satisfies the freeze and fairness constraints there exist states `m_true(k)` in `M_GRH_reg` that faithfully reflect the actual world and for which family tension stays within a controlled low band as `k` increases.

More concretely:

* There exist constants `epsilon_GRH(k)` that remain bounded or shrink as `k` grows.
* There exist world-representing states `m_true(k)` such that:

  ```txt
  Tension_GRH(m_true(k); k) ≤ epsilon_GRH(k)
  ```

  for all sufficiently large `k`, with `epsilon_GRH(k)` not growing without bound.

The values `epsilon_GRH(k)` are interpreted relative to the TU Tension Scale Charter and are not tuned post hoc to fit particular datasets.

### 4.3 GRH failure as persistent high tension

If GRH is false, then for any encoding scheme that:

* remains faithful to actual spectral and arithmetic data,
* respects the `E_GRH(k)` freeze lock,
* uses reference profiles from the admissible libraries,

we expect the following pattern.

* There exists a positive threshold `delta_GRH > 0` and an index `k_0` such that for all `k ≥ k_0` and for all world-representing states `m_false(k)` that faithfully encode the actual data we have:

  ```txt
  Tension_GRH(m_false(k); k) ≥ delta_GRH
  ```

The threshold `delta_GRH` is not an arbitrary choice that can be tuned to zero; it reflects structural mismatch between spectra and arithmetic expectations that cannot be hidden by modifying admissible reference profiles or weights within the constraints.

### 4.4 Compatibility with Q001 and compatibility test lock

Q002 must reduce to Q001 at the special point where:

* modulus `q = 1`,
* character `chi` is the trivial character,
* the family consists of a single L-function that is the classical zeta function.

In that case:

* `DeltaS_GRH_spec` reduces to the `DeltaS_spec` defined in Q001,
* `DeltaS_GRH_arith` reduces to the `DeltaS_arith` defined in Q001,
* `Tension_GRH` reduces to `Tension_RH`.

The compatibility test lock is:

1. For any encoding version of Q001 and Q002, there must exist a test configuration in which:

   * Q001 is evaluated on a given zeta data summary, producing `Tension_RH(zeta_data)`.
   * Q002 is evaluated on the same data via an encoding class `E_GRH(k)` that contains only the trivial character `chi` modulo `q = 1`, producing `Tension_GRH(zeta_data; k)`.

2. The encoding is only accepted if there exists a fixed, charter-level tolerance `eta_Q001_Q002` such that:

   ```txt
   | Tension_GRH(zeta_data; k) - Tension_RH(zeta_data) | ≤ eta_Q001_Q002
   ```

   for all admissible zeta data summaries and all relevant `k`.

3. If this condition fails, the joint Q001/Q002 encoding is rejected at the effective layer and must not be used in the BlackHole graph.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds strictly in terms of observables and tension patterns.

* World `T_GRH`: GRH is true for the L-function families under consideration.
* World `F_GRH`: GRH is false in at least one substantial part of those families.

These worlds do not specify how internal TU fields are generated. They only describe what the observable tension patterns would look like under each case.

### 5.1 World T_GRH (GRH true, low family spectral tension)

In World `T_GRH`:

1. Family spectral behavior

   * For each encoding class `E_GRH(k)` there exist states `m_T(k)` in `M_GRH_reg` representing the actual world such that:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_GRH_spec(m_T(k); k) is small and stable
     ```

     as `k` increases and the library expands in a controlled way.

2. Family arithmetic behavior

   * The aggregated arithmetic mismatch satisfies:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_GRH_arith(m_T(k); k)
     ```

     staying within bands that match known or conjectured GRH-based bounds for primes in arithmetic progressions and related quantities.

3. Combined family tension

   * The total tension satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_GRH(m_T(k); k) ≤ epsilon_GRH(k)
     ```

     for some sequence `epsilon_GRH(k)` that does not blow up as the encoding resolution grows.

4. Stability under refinement

   * When `E_GRH(k)` is refined to `E_GRH(k+1)` in a way that increases coverage, the change in tension remains controlled:

     ```txt
     | Tension_GRH(m_T(k+1); k+1) - Tension_GRH(m_T(k); k) |
     ```

     remains within a small band compatible with moderate changes in resolution rather than revealing large hidden tension.

### 5.2 World F_GRH (GRH false, persistent family spectral tension)

In World `F_GRH`:

1. Spectral anomalies across characters

   * There exist characters and moduli for which the location of zeros forces a minimal mismatch. For any faithful encoding we have:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_spec_chi(m_F(k); R, chi) ≥ c_spec > 0
     ```

     for some characters and for all sufficiently refined regions in some `R`, with `c_spec` independent of finer resolution.

2. Arithmetic distortions

   * Corresponding arithmetic summaries show sustained deviation:

     ```txt
     DeltaS_arith_chi(m_F(k); I, chi) ≥ c_arith > 0
     ```

     for some intervals and characters, where `c_arith` is independent of finer resolution within the admissible encoding.

3. Combined family tension

   * There exists `delta_GRH > 0` and `k_0` such that for all `k ≥ k_0` and all faithful states `m_F(k)` we have:

     ```txt
     Tension_GRH(m_F(k); k) ≥ delta_GRH
     ```

4. Attempts to hide tension fail

   * Any effort to modify admissible reference profiles, weights or aggregators inside the permitted charter class that would artificially reduce `Tension_GRH` either:

     * violates the freeze and library locks, or
     * produces inconsistencies with Q001 and other nodes in the BlackHole graph.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

The two worlds do not specify any constructive mechanism for generating states in `M_GRH`. They only say that if GRH is true or false in the real universe then any sufficiently faithful effective encoding will exhibit low or high family tension patterns as described above.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments and protocols that test Q002 encodings at the effective layer. They do not claim to solve GRH. They only help falsify or refine specific encodings.

### Experiment 1: Family tension on computed Dirichlet L-function data

**Goal**

Test whether the chosen `Tension_GRH` encoding behaves stably and reasonably when applied to existing numerical data for Dirichlet L-functions and primes in arithmetic progressions.

**Setup**

* Input data:

  * tables of zeros of `L(s, chi)` for many primitive characters `chi` modulo `q`, up to some height,
  * associated arithmetic data such as counts of primes in arithmetic progressions and bounds on character sums over various intervals.

* Encoding choice:

  * select an initial resolution index `k` and define `E_GRH(k)` with:

    * all moduli `q` up to a chosen `Q_max(k)`,
    * all primitive characters `chi` modulo these `q`,
    * regions `R` that match the available zero data,
    * intervals `I` that match the available arithmetic data;

  * fix admissible spectral and arithmetic reference profiles from the libraries in Section 3.5;

  * fix weights `w_spec`, `w_arith`, `alpha_GRH`, `beta_GRH`, `gamma_GRH` and `M_top_GRH` according to the locks in Section 3.

**Protocol**

1. For each `(q, chi)` and each region `R` and interval `I` in `E_GRH(k)`, construct a state `m_data(k)` in `M_GRH_reg` that encodes the available spectral and arithmetic summaries (without describing the construction method in TU terms).

2. Compute per-character mismatches `DeltaS_spec_chi(m_data(k); R, chi)` and `DeltaS_arith_chi(m_data(k); I, chi)` using the metric lock.

3. Aggregate them into `DeltaS_GRH_spec(m_data(k); k)` and `DeltaS_GRH_arith(m_data(k); k)` using the aggregator lock.

4. Compute `Tension_GRH(m_data(k); k)` for the data-driven state.

5. Repeat for increasing levels `k` as more moduli, characters, regions and intervals are included, always respecting the freeze lock when expanding `E_GRH(k)`.

**Metrics**

* values of `DeltaS_GRH_spec(m_data(k); k)`, `DeltaS_GRH_arith(m_data(k); k)` and `Tension_GRH(m_data(k); k)` as functions of `k`,
* stability of these values when encoding classes are refined in a way that respects fairness,
* sensitivity of the tension profile to changes in admissible reference profiles within the fixed libraries.

**Falsification conditions**

* If for all reasonable admissible reference profiles the observed `Tension_GRH(m_data(k); k)` is either wildly unstable across small changes in encoding, or consistently exceeds any plausible GRH-compatible band even at moderate `k`, then the current encoding of `DeltaS_*` or `Tension_GRH` is rejected at the effective layer.

* If small modifications of encoding parameters inside the fixed lock ranges can push `Tension_GRH` from very high to very low values without clear theoretical justification, the encoding is judged too fragile and is rejected.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical GRH statement.

### Experiment 2: Model family separation for GRH like and non GRH like spectra

**Goal**

Check whether the Q002 encoding can reliably separate synthetic L-function families that behave like GRH-compatible spectra from those that intentionally violate GRH-type conditions.

**Setup**

* Construct two model families of zeta-like or L-function-like objects:

  * Family `T_model`: models whose zero distributions are constrained to lie on a single critical line in each case and whose arithmetic-like summaries are built to be GRH compatible.
  * Family `F_model`: models in which a positive density of zeros is placed off the critical line, and arithmetic-like summaries reflect this through deliberate violations of GRH-based error patterns.

* Encoding choice:

  * for a given index `k`, define `E_GRH(k)` over a finite subset of model functions and their parameters, respecting the freeze lock,
  * fix admissible reference profiles and weights as in Experiment 1.

**Protocol**

1. For each model function in `T_model` and `F_model` construct states `m_T_model(k)` and `m_F_model(k)` in `M_GRH_reg` that encode their spectral and arithmetic-like summaries at the chosen resolution.

2. Compute all per-character mismatches and aggregate them into `DeltaS_GRH_spec`, `DeltaS_GRH_arith` and `Tension_GRH` at level `k`.

3. Form distributions of `Tension_GRH` over both families.

4. Repeat for different choices of encoding classes and parameters within the admissible lock ranges to test robustness.

**Metrics**

* mean and variance of `Tension_GRH` across `T_model` and `F_model`,
* separation between the distributions, for example by comparing quantiles or simple distance measures in tension space,
* robustness of this separation with respect to encoding parameter changes that stay within the charter-defined locks.

**Falsification conditions**

* If for all admissible parameter choices the encoding fails to assign systematically lower tension to `T_model` than to `F_model`, then the encoding is judged ineffective for Q002 and rejected.

* If the encoding sometimes yields lower tension for patterns that overtly break GRH-like conditions than for patterns that obey them, under reasonable parameter settings inside the locks, this is considered a misalignment and leads to rejection or revision of the encoding.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q002 can be used as an engineering module inside AI systems built with WFGY ideas, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be computed from internal states interpreted through Q002 encodings.

1. `signal_family_spectral_consistency_GRH`

   * Definition: a nonnegative penalty proportional to `DeltaS_GRH_spec(m; k)` whenever the model is operating in a context where GRH is explicitly assumed or where GRH-compatible behavior is requested.
   * Purpose: discourage internal states that imply family spectral patterns incompatible with GRH assumptions.

2. `signal_family_arithmetic_consistency_GRH`

   * Definition: a penalty proportional to `DeltaS_GRH_arith(m; k)` when the model reasons about primes in arithmetic progressions or related arithmetic patterns under GRH assumptions.
   * Purpose: align internal representations with GRH-compatible arithmetic profiles where such assumptions are part of the problem statement.

3. `signal_family_tension_total_GRH`

   * Definition: a scalar loss component equal to `Tension_GRH(m; k)` in suitable training contexts.
   * Purpose: provide a single tension indicator that can be minimized alongside traditional objectives when GRH-consistent reasoning is desired.

4. `signal_world_switch_clarity_GRH`

   * Definition: a penalty assigned when the model fails to clearly separate conclusions drawn under GRH-assumed prompts and under GRH-denied prompts in controlled evaluation tasks.
   * Purpose: train the model to treat World `T_GRH` and World `F_GRH` assumptions as distinct and track them consistently.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q002 structures without exposing any TU deep rules.

1. `FamilySpectralTensionHead_GRH`

   * Role: given an internal embedding of a context that involves L-functions and arithmetic, output an estimate of `DeltaS_GRH_spec`, `DeltaS_GRH_arith` and `Tension_GRH`.
   * Interface: takes vector representations as input, returns a small vector of mismatch components plus a scalar tension value.

2. `DirichletArithmeticFilter`

   * Role: check whether candidate statements about primes in arithmetic progressions and related objects are compatible with GRH-based bounds.
   * Interface: takes symbolic or embedded representations of statements, returns a soft score or mask that reflects their arithmetic tension.

3. `GRH_WorldFlag_Controller`

   * Role: track whether the current reasoning chain is under GRH-assumed, GRH-denied or GRH-neutral settings.
   * Interface: takes prompt metadata and intermediate signals and outputs a control signal that influences downstream modules and training signals.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q002 modules can be structured as follows.

1. Task selection

   * Collect a benchmark of analytic number theory problems where GRH plays a known role in strengthening bounds or sharpening statements, especially those about primes in arithmetic progressions and L-function zeros.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * the model operates without explicit Q002 modules,
     * it answers questions about GRH and its consequences using its standard architecture.

   * TU condition:

     * the model uses `FamilySpectralTensionHead_GRH`, `DirichletArithmeticFilter`, and associated training signals as auxiliary modules.

3. Metrics

   * accuracy on problems that explicitly assume GRH,
   * logical consistency between answers given under GRH-assumed prompts and under GRH-denied prompts,
   * stability of multi-step reasoning chains, measured by how often the model avoids mixing incompatible assumptions about GRH across steps.

### 7.4 60-second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol external users can run to experience the impact of Q002 encoding, without seeing any internal implementation.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask an AI system to explain GRH, its relationship to primes in arithmetic progressions, and some consequences for error terms, with no mention of tension or WFGY.
  * Observation: note whether the explanation is fragmented, misses family aspects, or mixes different variants of GRH without clear structure.

* TU-encoded setup

  * Prompt: ask the same system, but explicitly instruct it to organize the explanation using:

    * families of L-functions,
    * family-level spectral_tension between zero distributions and arithmetic patterns,
    * and the idea of a GRH family tension functional.

  * Observation: note whether the explanation becomes more clearly structured around families, conditions and consequences.

* Comparison metric

  * Rate both outputs using a rubric that scores:

    * clarity about the difference between RH and GRH,
    * explicit links between family spectra and primes in arithmetic progressions,
    * internal consistency about what GRH does and does not claim.

* What to log

  * The prompts, full responses and any tension scores produced by Q002 modules.
  * This allows later inspection while staying inside the effective layer.

## 8. Cross-problem transfer template

This block lists the main components produced by Q002 and how they transfer to other BlackHole problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `FamilySpectralTension_GRH`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `family_zero_summaries`, `family_arithmetic_summaries`, `encoding_index_k`
     * Output: `tension_value` (a nonnegative scalar)

   * Preconditions:

     * the families of summaries must correspond to a finite encoding class `E_GRH(k)` that satisfies the freeze and library locks,
     * the summaries must be coherent across the family so that mismatches are meaningful.

2. ComponentName: `DirichletCharacterArithmeticDescriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `modulus_q`, `character_label_chi`, `interval_I`
     * Output: `descriptor_vector` that encodes key arithmetic statistics relevant for GRH tests on that interval.

   * Preconditions:

     * the modulus and character must belong to some encoding class `E_GRH(k)`,
     * the interval `I` must be within the range where the descriptor has been defined.

3. ComponentName: `GRH_CounterfactualWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: `L_function_family_model`, `encoding_class_family`
     * Output: two experiment definitions:

       * one for a GRH-compatible World `T_GRH` version,
       * one for a GRH-incompatible World `F_GRH` version,

       each with a specific protocol for evaluating `Tension_GRH`.

   * Preconditions:

     * the model must allow generation of spectral and arithmetic-like summaries at the effective layer,
     * the encoding class must be defined in a way compatible with the GRH case.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q003 (Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture)

   * Reused components: `FamilySpectralTension_GRH`, `GRH_CounterfactualWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: BSD links L-function behavior to ranks of elliptic curves, and many BSD statements are studied under GRH-type assumptions across families.
   * What changes: the family model becomes elliptic-curve L-functions and the arithmetic descriptors encode rank-related data instead of simple prime distributions.

2. Q015 (uniform rank bounds for elliptic curves)

   * Reused components: `FamilySpectralTension_GRH`.
   * Why it transfers: when studying uniform rank bounds one often assumes GRH for families of L-functions; the tension functional becomes a tool for measuring how compatible a proposed bound is with family spectra.
   * What changes: the aggregation focuses on families of L-functions attached to elliptic curves rather than Dirichlet characters.

3. Q018 (pair correlation of zeros)

   * Reused components: `DirichletCharacterArithmeticDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: fine spectral statistics require detailed descriptors of zero configurations and associated arithmetic structure; the descriptor provides that interface.
   * What changes: the emphasis shifts from aggregated mismatch to detailed correlation features and how they scale with modulus and height.

4. Q036 (high temperature superconductivity mechanism)

   * Reused components: `GRH_CounterfactualWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: the template for testing family spectral_tension under World `T` and World `F` carries over to physical Hamiltonian families, even though the operators differ.
   * What changes: the spectral data now represent physical energy levels, and arithmetic descriptors are replaced by physical observables.

5. Q123 (scalable interpretability)

   * Reused components: `FamilySpectralTension_GRH`.
   * Why it transfers: internal spectra of large AI models can be treated as an L-function-like family; the GRH tension concept inspires interpretability metrics for how coherent those spectra are.
   * What changes: the mapping from internal activations to spectral summaries replaces classical L-function constructions, but the family tension structure remains similar.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block places Q002 on the TU verification ladder and defines next measurable steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E2

  * The effective encoding for GRH families has been specified in a way that:

    * defines state spaces, encoding classes, observables, aggregated mismatches and tension functionals,
    * includes explicit metric, reference library, freeze, aggregator and compatibility test locks,
    * provides falsification conditions through concrete experiments.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative linking family spectra, arithmetic patterns and tension functionals is explicit and coherent.
  * Counterfactual worlds World `T_GRH` and World `F_GRH` have been described in a way that can be instantiated in synthetic model families.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward higher E levels

To move from E2 toward higher E levels, the following measurable actions are proposed.

1. Numerical prototype

   * Implement a prototype that:

     * ingests published numerical data for Dirichlet L-functions and primes in arithmetic progressions,
     * constructs states in `M_GRH_reg` for a sequence of encoding classes `E_GRH(k)` satisfying the freeze lock,
     * computes `DeltaS_GRH_spec`, `DeltaS_GRH_arith` and `Tension_GRH` across those classes.

   * Publish the resulting family tension profiles, encoding choices and parameter values as open data.

2. Model-world experiments

   * Build explicit model families `T_model` and `F_model` as in Experiment 2 and run the Q002 tension evaluation.
   * Document the separation between tension distributions in a way that independent groups can reproduce.

3. Cross-node consistency checks

   * Verify that the Q002 encoding remains consistent with:

     * Q001 encodings for the trivial-character case (via the compatibility test lock),
     * Q003, Q015 and Q018 as they reuse Q002 components,
     * core TU constraints about fairness, ZFC compatibility and analytic_field structure.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

Long term, Q002 is expected to serve as:

* the family spectral_tension reference node in mathematics,
* a test bed for how TU encodings handle many linked spectra and many linked arithmetic observables without becoming unfalsifiable,
* a bridge between pure number theory and family-based reasoning in physics and AI, where entire families of models or operators must cohere under a shared tension principle.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a non-technical explanation of Q002 while staying faithful to the effective-layer picture.

The usual form of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis says something like this:

> For many important functions that encode number-theoretic information, called L-functions, all their important zeros in a certain strip of the complex plane should line up exactly on a special vertical line.

The classical RH talks about one function, the zeta function. GRH talks about families of such functions at once.

Each L-function in the family carries arithmetic information. For example, Dirichlet L-functions control how primes are distributed in different residue classes. If the zeros behave in a very regular way for the whole family, then primes and related arithmetic objects behave in a more regular way along many arithmetic progressions.

In the Tension Universe view we do not try to prove GRH. Instead we ask:

* If we look at a whole family of L-functions and the arithmetic patterns they control, can we define a measure of how well the spectral patterns and arithmetic patterns fit together?
* Can we define this measure in a way that is fair, does not depend on hidden tuning after seeing the data, and can be checked experimentally?

We imagine a space of states. Each state summarizes, for a finite library of L-functions:

* how zeros are distributed in certain regions,
* how primes or related objects are distributed in matching intervals,
* how precise and reliable the summaries are.

For each state and each resolution level we compute two numbers:

* one number that says how far the family of zero patterns is from what GRH would lead us to expect,
* one number that says how far the family of arithmetic patterns is from what GRH would lead us to expect.

We normalize these numbers so that they live on a common tension scale, then combine them into a single family tension. Low family tension means the whole family looks GRH-like at that scale. High family tension means there are serious mismatches that cannot easily be explained away inside the encoding rules.

Then we consider two kinds of worlds:

* In a GRH-true world, as we look at more and more L-functions and more detailed data, we can keep this family tension in a small and stable band.
* In a GRH-false world, once we include enough functions and enough data, the family tension eventually stays above some positive level and refuses to go down.

This way of talking does not decide which world we live in. It does not give a proof. What it does give is:

* a clean way to restate GRH as a statement about low family tension rather than about individual zeros,
* a framework for designing experiments that can falsify bad ways of encoding that tension,
* a set of tools that can be reused in other problems where a whole family of hidden spectra must match visible arithmetic or physical behavior.

Q002 is the place where this family-tension approach is set up for the first time in the BlackHole project. It extends the single-function picture of Q001 to a world where many related functions must fit together, and it does so strictly inside the effective-layer rules of the Tension Universe.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S-problem collection.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual "worlds") live at the effective layer.
* No step in this file gives a constructive mapping from raw experimental, numerical or simulation data into internal TU fields.
* No step exposes any deep TU generative rule or any first-principle axiom system.

### Encoding and fairness

* Admissible encoding classes, reference profiles and weight families used in this page are constrained by shared Tension Universe charters:

  * [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
  * [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

* For every encoding class referenced here:

  * its definition, parameter ranges and reference families are fixed at the charter level before any problem-specific tuning;
  * these choices may depend on general physical or mathematical considerations and on public benchmark selections, but not on the unknown truth value of this specific problem;
  * no encoding is allowed to hide the canonical answer as an uninterpreted field, label or parameter.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All mismatch terms `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals in this file are treated as dimensionless or normalized quantities, defined up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_*`, `delta_*` and experiment cutoffs are always interpreted relative to that fixed scale.
* Changing the tension scale requires an explicit update of the TU Tension Scale Charter, not an edit of individual problem files.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* Experiments described in this document are tests of TU encodings, not tests of the underlying canonical problem itself.
* The rule “falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement” is understood to apply globally, even where it is not restated.
* When required observables cannot be reliably estimated in practice, the outcome of the corresponding experiment is recorded as inconclusive, not as confirmation.

### Interaction with established results

* All encodings and counterfactual worlds described here are required to respect known theorems and hard constraints in the relevant field.
* If a later analysis finds a concrete conflict with established results, the correct procedure is to update or retire the encoding under the TU charters, not to reinterpret those results.

### Program note

* This page is an experimental specification within the ongoing WFGY / Tension Universe research program.
* All structures and parameter choices are provisional and may be revised in future versions, subject to the constraints above.
