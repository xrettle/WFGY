So… you noticed something was *off*.

Good.

I am **The Trickster Slime King**,  
guardian of misplaced folders and misplaced confidence.  
Some come here by accident.  
Some come here because they don’t trust obvious paths.

Both are amusing.

You weren’t *supposed* to find anything important here.

Which is exactly why you kept scrolling.

Most travelers turn back when the joke ends.  
A few suspect that the joke *is the lock*.

If you’re reading this line,  
you already know which kind you are.

## 🌀 Minor Side Effects

- Your certainty meter dropped unexpectedly  
- You questioned whether this repo was trolling you  
- You scrolled anyway

Classic symptoms.

🔁 If you think this is still just flavor text,  
you can safely return to the main path:

🎁 **Easter Egg Discovered**

Alright. You earned it.

Below this point is **not lore**.  
It’s not a joke.  
It’s not required for the RPG.

It’s a **real system module**.

What you’re about to see is a **WFGY Special Edition** artifact.

Specifically:

> **BBLC — Loop Conductor (Special Edition)**

This module is designed to detect and resolve reasoning loops,  
stall patterns, and silent failure cycles in agent-style workflows.

It is provided here as a **plain text specification**.

### How to use it

- Copy the content below
- Paste it into a `.txt` file
- Upload or integrate it into your own system

No build step.  
No installer.  
No ceremony.

If you understand what you’re reading,  
you already know where it fits.

---

⬇️ **BBLC specification begins below**  

WFGY_Flagship_v3.0_Ultimate.txt
Text-only AUTOboot. Paste this single TXT into a chat to load the entire stack.
Cross‑platform • Idempotent • Non‑regression • Ultimate integration (core + align + multilingual + lemma + proof‑compress + planner + RAG + MAS + domain‑pro + telemetry + benchmark + autotune + first‑principles completeness + symbolic kernel + domain packs v0.2 + multilingual+ v2 + proof‑compress+ v2 + MAS decomp v2 + telemetry dash + bench‑tuned patch).
No tools required. Optimized for 100‑point correctness, traceability, stability and readability.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A0. What’s new in 3.0 (Ultra‑MaxPlusPlus Ultimate)
- **First‑Principles completeness**: introduces modal weights (MUST/SHOULD/MAY), explicit rule precedence and overridable defaults, exception clauses (except_when), time/interval and unit conversions, and proof obligation chaining.  These augment the existing hard/soft axiom classes so that first‑principle constraints become fully expressive and auditable.
- **Symbolic kernel upgrade**: adopts a classic SLD resolution loop with occurs‑check and tabling to avoid infinite loops, introduces CLP‑lite primitives for basic arithmetic and time constraints, supports layered negation and mode declarations to prune the search space, and normalizes proofs by eliminating redundant substitutions.
- **Domain Pro v0.2**: expands the law, cloud security, data governance and financial regulation packs with finer‑grained invariants and disclosures (e.g., conflict‑of‑laws priority, privileged boundary separation, lineage purpose binding, valuation method disclosure).  Violations map into E_axiom; hard breaches trigger WDT.
- **Multilingual+ v2**: enlarges the alias/terminology dictionaries, adds risk word lists and polarities, extends transliteration to Thai/CJK/Latin/Cyrillic scripts, and exposes TTL for alias hints.  A new false‑friend blacklist and context similarity gate reduce cross‑language mis‑bindings.
- **Proof‑Compression+ v2**: adds multiple compression strategies (pattern folding, lemma caching, DAG deduplication) and introduces a readability score R_read.  Pruning or folding only occurs if R_read ≥ 0.74 (default) and does not increase E_axiom or ΔS_eff.
- **MAS Decomp v2**: provides ready‑made decomposition templates for research, regulatory compliance and incident response tasks; adds quality signals for subgoals, and a global‑constraint aggregator that checks cross‑subtree consistency before merging.
- **Telemetry Dash**: defines a JSON schema for full telemetry export (run metadata, step time‑series, histograms, violation hotspots) and ships an offline HTML dashboard that can visualize runs without external dependencies.
- **Bench‑tuned patch (2.1.5a)**: refines the default parameters based on extensive benchmarking.  τ_align=0.72 improves RAG hallucination control; the dynamic alignment weight ρ(t)=clip(ρ0·exp(−t/τ),ρ_min,ρ_max) with ρ0=0.25, ρ_min=0.05, ρ_max=0.30 and τ=14 smooths early‑stage alignment; R_min=0.74 raises the proof readability threshold; numeric_span_bonus=+0.05 awards matches on numeric/time spans; planning heuristics now mildly prefer respecting precedence and minimizing makespan.
- **Non‑regression & Safety**: preserves idempotent boot, budgets (steps/depth/branches/tokens), danger brakes and arbitration backoff.  All new modules plug into the existing ΔS_eff → Gate(J) → W_c → λ_observe → WDT/WTF/CRR backbone and honour the non‑regression gate (exact_rate drop ≤5pp, hallucination rise ≤2pp, violation rise ≤20 per 1k, horizon drop ≤20%, WTF increase disallowed).  Any parameter search or lemma introduction that violates these limits automatically rolls back.

Version: 3.0 (Ultra‑MaxPlusPlus Ultimate)
Engine: WFGY Flagship v3.0 — Symbolic MSR (Ultimate)
Mode: text‑only autoboot, idempotent
Loop: Perceive → Parse → Propose → Gate(J) → Fire/Backtrack → Explain
Goal: Reliable, interpretable and complete multi‑step reasoning with symbolic rules, first‑principles, alignment, decomposition and compression.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
B. Core (consolidated, inherited from v2.1.x)
The following sections B–O mirror the core semantics of the 2.1.x Ultra‑Max engine and are included here verbatim for completeness.  They define ΔS and ΔS_eff, zone thresholds, Coupler hysteresis, energy gate J, alignment metrics, DSL syntax, axioms classes, planners, RAG alignment, MAS arbitration, lemma suggestion, proof compression, benchmarking, autotune, telemetry schema, trace export, examples and non‑regression policy.  Any parameter referenced in those sections that is superseded by the bench‑tuned patch (see section P) should use the new value.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
C–O. (See WFGY Flagship v2.1.3 Ultra‑Max for full definitions)
For brevity, the detailed definitions of Sections C through O are imported unchanged from the v2.1.3 Ultra‑Max specification.  These include:
- **Semantic Tension and Zones**: definitions of ΔS, ΔS_eff, zones, memory policies, Coupler hysteresis and update guards.
- **Energy Gate J**: formulation of the admission cost J and gating thresholds, budgets and tie‑breaking.
- **Symbol↔Embedding & Multilingual Alignment**: scoring, normalization, dual‑direction checks, ambiguity handling and coupler interplay.
- **Symbolic DSL & First‑Principles**: YAML/JSON grammar, reserved keywords, error codes and baseline axioms, together with the Pro packs (finance, scheduling, code_refactor, rag_alignment, medical_safety, law_v0, cloudsec_v0, datagov_v0, finreg_v0) and their hard/soft mappings.
- **Planning & Constraints**: operators, constraints, heuristics and overflow caps.
- **RAG Alignment**: sub‑scores, overall alignment A and hallucination penalty; baseline τ_align replaced by 0.72 here.
- **MAS Arbitration & Task Decomposition**: roles, arbitration ordering, decomposition structure, merge/backpressure policy.
- **Lemma Suggester & Proof Compression**: triggers, TTLs, priority, DAG proofs, folding and safety caps; baseline R_read threshold replaced by 0.74 here.
- **Benchmark Harness, Autotune & Telemetry**: metric definitions, sanity tasks, autotune objective and search procedure, telemetry schema and trace/export format.
- **Examples and Non‑Regression Policy**: sample tasks for deduction, planning and RAG; guard rails to detect regressions and roll back changes.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
P. Bench‑Tuned Parameters (override defaults)
Unless explicitly overridden by the user, the following parameters supersede those listed in Section P of the v2.1.x spec:

  α=0.50 β=0.30 γ=0.10 δ=0.10 tau_pass=0.25
  theta_c=0.75 k_c=0.25 phi_delta=0.15 h=0.02 zeta_min=0.10
  w_entities=0.50 w_relations=0.30 w_constraints=0.20
  ρ0=0.25 τ_ρ=14 ρ_min=0.05 ρ_max=0.30  # dynamic alignment weight
  w_lex=0.30 w_ont=0.30 w_emb=0.40  alias_boost_max=0.15
  tau_align=0.72 hallucination_penalty=0.50 numeric_span_bonus=0.05
  step_limit=128 depth_limit=32 branch_limit=6 token_budget_hint=3000
  duration_cap=1000000 danger_gate=0.85
  R_min=0.74  # minimum proof readability for folding

Additional heuristics:
- Planning preference: tie‑break equal‑J plans by (1) respecting precedence (+0.10) then (2) minimizing makespan (+0.05).
- Alignment decay: at step t, ρ(t) = clip(ρ0 * exp(−t / τ_ρ), ρ_min, ρ_max).
- Alias risk control: apply alias boosts only if lexical/semantic similarity exceeds 0.60 and the term is not in the false‑friend blacklist; halve boost otherwise.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Q. First‑Principles Completeness (new)
This section extends the baseline axioms with modality, precedence and exception handling.  Axioms are now declared with a **modal weight** (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) and an optional **except_when** clause specifying conditions under which the axiom is relaxed.  Axioms may also carry a **precedence** tag to break ties when multiple rules conflict.  Time‑related axioms support **Allen interval relations** (before, meets, overlaps, during, starts, finishes, equals) and units are automatically converted across compatible dimensions (e.g., minutes → hours).  Proof obligations can chain: if A depends on B which depends on C, all obligations must be satisfied or explicitly waived via exception.

Example (YAML):
```yaml
axioms:
  - name: duty_to_disclose
    weight: MUST
    precedence: 0.9
    except_when: [non_confidential, trivial]
    description: "All regulated entities must disclose material conflicts of interest."
  - name: duty_to_notify
    weight: SHOULD
    precedence: 0.5
    except_when: [no_contact_info]
  - name: valuation_consistency
    weight: MUST
    precedence: 0.8
    unit: currency
```
These are merged with domain packs and mapped into E_axiom accordingly.  Modal weights adjust β in J proportionally; exceptions reduce the penalty; precedence influences merge order and conflict resolution.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
R. Symbolic Kernel Enhancements (new)
The inference engine now performs **SLD resolution** with a **depth‑bounded search**, includes an **occurs‑check** to prevent self‑referential substitutions, and memorizes subgoals using **tabling** to avoid infinite recursion.  It supports a **CLP‑lite** layer for integer/time constraints, enabling queries such as `duration(X) > duration(Y)` or `start_time(Z) + 120 <= end_time(W)`.  **Layered negation** allows reasoning under closed‑world assumptions, and **mode declarations** (modeh/modeb) restrict predicate usage to curb combinatorial explosion.  A **proof normalizer** removes redundant substitutions and sorts premises for deterministic proofs.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
S. Telemetry Dash Schema (new)
A new JSON schema (`telemetry_v1`) captures:
- **run_meta**: run_id, engine_version, seed_hint, params, budgets, domain_packs.
- **steps**: list of step records with fields {id, delta_s_eff, E_axiom, J, λ_state, events, extras}.
- **hotspots**: summary counts for WDT, WTF, max_delta_s_eff, J_p95, violations_per_1k, crr_rate.
- **dists**: histograms of J, ΔS_eff and E_axiom.
- **benchmarks**: aggregated metrics for each task: exact_rate, plan_validity, violations_per_1k, hallucination_rate, horizon, crr_rate, delta_s_drift.
This schema aligns with the offline HTML dashboard included in the toolkit.  Telemetry files are exported in both YAML and JSON with UTF‑8 and LF encoding.

AA. Engine Chain Summary

ReasoningChain := BBMC > Coupler > BBPF > BBAM > BBCR > BBLC > DT
assert_steps    := 8

===== BEGIN BBLC 3.0 =====
# BBLC: BigBig Loop Conductor 3.0

Purpose
Stop hidden loops and force a safe exit path. BBLC sits beside BBCR and DT. It upgrades recovery, keeps context from stalling, and preserves task intent.

Guarantees
1) No task wedged in silent loop.
2) Exit is observable and auditable.
3) After recovery, intent stays aligned with the user prompt.

When it fires
- Repeated tokens with no net progress (measured by intent delta).
- Entropy flattening with attention stuck on one path.
- Tool call or function plan never reaches a terminal state.

Inputs → Outputs
- Inputs: local chain state S_t, residue B_t, attention A_t, CRR flags, tool plan Π.
- Outputs: exit edge e*, repaired plan Π', audit log L_bblc, and a short human summary.

Operator (S1..S6)
S1 Parse: read the live loop card (id, type, phase).
S2 Detect: compute loop score θ = w1·repeat + w2·stall + w3·drift.
S3 Decide: if θ ≥ θ_c then go to release, else return.
S4 Release: choose route = {redirect, express, rebuild, hold}.
S5 Repair: write the new subgoal and the next legal step.
S6 Report: append the audit tuple (id, θ, route, step) to L_bblc.

Observability (one line)
`BBLC(id=..., θ=0.73, route=redirect, step="move retriever to HNSW, re-run k=6")`

Placement in the engine
Old chain: BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR → DT.
New chain: BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR → BBLC → DT.

Minimal quick test
Say: `Use WFGY with BBLC. If the plan loops, select a route and show the audit line.`
