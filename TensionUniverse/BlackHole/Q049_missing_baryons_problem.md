## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal of this page is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the missing baryons problem in terms of:

  * state spaces,
  * observables and fields,
  * invariants and tension functionals,
  * counterfactual tension worlds,
  * falsifiable experiment patterns,
  * AI and engineering hooks.
* This page does not define or expose any TU-generating rules, axiom systems, or microphysical equations that might underlie the effective-layer objects.
* No explicit mapping is given from raw survey catalogs, simulation outputs, or microscopic baryon configurations to the internal state space `M`. We only assume the existence of admissible encodings that are compatible with the constraints stated here.
* The canonical missing baryons problem remains an open problem in cosmology. This document does not claim to solve it or to locate all baryons. It only provides a structured way to talk about baryon-budget tension at the effective layer.
* All symbols such as `M`, `Omega_b_true`, `Omega_b_obs`, `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, `Tension_MB`, and all counterfactual "worlds" live at this effective layer. They must not be read as claims about ultimate ontology or about the true microscopic state of the universe.
* Any implementation, tool, or AI module that reuses components from Q049 is expected to respect the effective-layer boundary and the TU charters on encoding and fairness. Numerical artifacts or implementation choices can be revised without changing the content of this specification.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The standard cosmological model provides a precise estimate of the cosmic baryon density, often written in terms of a density parameter

```txt
Omega_b_true
```

inferred from early-universe probes such as big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background anisotropies under a specified cosmological model.

At low redshift, independent observations count baryons in different phases, for example:

* stars in galaxies
* cold and warm gas in galaxies
* hot gas in clusters and groups
* diffuse intergalactic and circumgalactic media

The missing baryons problem is the tension between:

* the theoretically and observationally well-constrained total baryon density `Omega_b_true`, and
* the sum of all observed baryon components at low redshift, which historically falls short of `Omega_b_true` by a significant fraction.

In other words:

> Where are the baryons that should exist according to early-universe cosmology, but that are not clearly accounted for in the census of visible and diffuse matter at later times?

This canonical formulation belongs to standard cosmology and is not introduced by TU. The present document restates it and builds an effective-layer encoding. It does not claim any new physical solution.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key facts about the status:

* Cosmic microwave background measurements provide high-precision values of `Omega_b_true` that are widely accepted within the standard cosmological model.
* Low redshift surveys historically recovered only a fraction of this baryon density when summing known components such as stars, cold gas, and hot cluster gas.
* Subsequent observations have revealed additional baryon reservoirs, especially in warm hot intergalactic medium and circumgalactic medium, but uncertainties remain large.
* Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations predict that a large fraction of baryons may reside in diffuse, low-density phases that are observationally challenging to detect.

The difficulty arises from:

* the need to combine multiple observational techniques across a wide range of environments and redshifts,
* uncertain feedback processes (for example galactic winds and active galactic nucleus feedback) that redistribute baryons across phases and length scales,
* systematic uncertainties in converting observables into baryon mass estimates.

The problem is not whether baryons exist in some absolute sense. The practical questions are:

* whether we can identify and quantify all major baryon reservoirs,
* whether we can reconcile the early-universe baryon budget with late-time phase-resolved baryon distributions,
* whether we can understand the dynamical processes that move baryons between phases.

Within TU, Q049 treats these questions as a thermodynamic-tension node. It encodes budget and phase-partition tension at the effective layer only and does not claim to settle which cosmological model is correct.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q049 plays three roles:

1. It is a prototype of a thermodynamic_tension problem where a conserved quantity (baryon number) is distributed across multiple phases and environments.
2. It provides a concrete arena for studying hidden reservoirs and incomplete observational coverage in a high-precision cosmological setting.
3. It serves as a bridge node linking:

   * early-universe parameter inference (via Q044 and CMB-related nodes),
   * large-scale structure and feedback physics (via Q045 and related nodes),
   * cross-domain hidden-reservoir problems (for example climate and epidemiology nodes).

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q049 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge is listed with a one-line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These problems provide prerequisites, tools, or general foundations that Q049 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q044 (BH_COSMO_INIT_COND_L3_044)
  Reason: Provides primordial baryon density and initial conditions that define the global baryon budget observable `Omega_b_true` used in Q049.

* Q045 (BH_COSMO_LSS_FORM_L3_045)
  Reason: Encodes large-scale structure formation that determines where baryons can cluster, be shock heated, or remain diffuse in the cosmic web.

* Q041 (BH_COSMO_DARKMATTER_L3_041)
  Reason: Specifies gravitational potential wells and halo populations that control baryon trapping and ejection across environments.

* Q043 (BH_COSMO_INFLATION_SPECTRUM_L3_043)

  Reason: Q049 and Q042 both encode thermodynamic_tension on cosmic inventory consistency, but for different components (baryons versus dark energy).

* Q048 (BH_COSMO_H0_TENSION_L3_048)
  Reason: Both are consistency-tension problems comparing early-universe parameter inferences with late-universe observables.

* Q091 (BH_CLIMATE_ECS_L3_091)
  Reason: Both study how hidden reservoirs and phase partitions control global observables and feedbacks.

### 2.4 Cross-domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q049 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses thermodynamic-tension functionals on phase partitions to study energy-entropy budgets in information processing systems.

* Q091 (BH_CLIMATE_ECS_L3_091)
  Reason: Uses the `MissingReservoirWorldTemplate` component as an analogy for hidden heat and carbon reservoirs in the climate system.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces
* observables and fields
* invariants and tension scores
* singular sets and domain restrictions

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or construction of internal TU fields from raw survey data or simulations.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer:

* Each element `m` in `M` represents a coherent baryon-budget world configuration over a chosen redshift bin `z` and environment partition. Environments can include clusters, groups, filaments, field galaxies, and voids.
* A state `m` encodes, at a coarse-grained level:

  * estimates of baryon mass in different phases (for example stars, cold gas, warm gas, hot gas, diffuse warm hot intergalactic medium, circumgalactic medium) for the redshift bin,
  * indicators of observational completeness for each phase,
  * basic information about the large-scale structure environment fractions.

We do not specify how `m` is constructed from catalogs, maps, or simulation outputs. We only assume that:

* For any redshift bin and environment partition of interest, there exist states in `M` that summarize the phase-resolved baryon distribution and its uncertainties in a self-consistent way.

### 3.2 Observables and fields

We introduce the following effective observables on `M` for a given redshift bin `z`.

1. Global baryon density observables

```txt
Omega_b_true
Omega_b_obs(m, z)
```

* `Omega_b_true` is a scalar representing the cosmic baryon density inferred from early-universe probes under a fixed baseline cosmological model. Within this entry, it is treated as a given parameter, not a random quantity.
* `Omega_b_obs(m, z)` is a scalar representing the total baryon density recovered from all explicitly tracked phases in state `m` at redshift `z`.

2. Phase-resolved baryon fractions

```txt
f_phase(m, phase, z)
```

* Input: state `m`, phase label, and redshift `z`.
* Output: a scalar fraction between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of the total baryon budget assigned to that phase in `m` at `z`.
* By construction:

  ```txt
  0 <= f_phase(m, phase, z) <= 1
  sum over phases of f_phase(m, phase, z) <= 1
  ```

3. Observational completeness indicators

```txt
C_obs(m, phase, z)
```

* Input: state `m`, phase, redshift `z`.
* Output: a scalar between 0 and 1 measuring how well that phase is constrained by observations at `z`.
* Interpretation:

  * `C_obs = 0` means essentially unconstrained or only upper limits.
  * `C_obs` near 1 means well constrained with multiple independent probes.

4. Baryon budget mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_baryon(m, z) >= 0
```

* Measures the deviation between `Omega_b_true` and `Omega_b_obs(m, z)` in a normalized way.

* A simple functional form is:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_baryon(m, z) =
      |Omega_b_true - Omega_b_obs(m, z)| / Omega_b_true
  ```

* Properties:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_baryon(m, z) >= 0
  DeltaS_baryon(m, z) = 0 if Omega_b_obs(m, z) = Omega_b_true
  ```

5. Phase-distribution mismatch observable

We choose a reference phase partition at redshift `z`, denoted by

```txt
f_ref(phase, z)
```

taken from a fixed, admissible reference source such as a specific simulation suite or a published review.

We then define:

```txt
DeltaS_phase(m, z) >= 0
```

as a nonnegative scalar measuring the deviation between `f_phase(m, phase, z)` and `f_ref(phase, z)` across phases, for example:

```txt
DeltaS_phase(m, z) =
    sum over phases of w_phase(phase, z) *
    |f_phase(m, phase, z) - f_ref(phase, z)|
```

where:

* `w_phase(phase, z)` are fixed nonnegative weights that sum to 1 across phases at each `z`,
* both `f_phase` and `f_ref` are interpreted as fractions of `Omega_b_true`.

Properties:

```txt
DeltaS_phase(m, z) >= 0
DeltaS_phase(m, z) = 0 if f_phase(m, phase, z) = f_ref(phase, z) for all phases
```

### 3.3 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

We denote by `E_adm` the admissible class of encoding rules for Q049. An element `enc` of `E_adm` is a procedure that maps raw or summarized data for a given redshift bin and environment partition to a state `m` in `M`, together with associated observables such as `Omega_b_obs`, `f_phase`, and `C_obs`.

To avoid hidden tuning and retrospective fitting, `E_adm` is required to satisfy the following fairness constraints.

1. Early-universe baryon density

   * The reference baryon density `Omega_b_true` is fixed by early-universe probes under a specified baseline cosmological model.
   * `Omega_b_true` is chosen outside Q049 and is not adjusted based on late-time baryon census results.

2. Reference phase partition menu

   * There exists a documented menu of admissible reference partitions:

     ```txt
     F_ref_menu(z) = { f_ref^a(phase, z), f_ref^b(phase, z), ... }
     ```

     derived from selected simulation suites or review compilations.

   * For a given analysis, one `f_ref` is chosen from `F_ref_menu(z)` before any `DeltaS_phase` values are computed on world data.

   * The choice of `f_ref` cannot depend on the realized values of `f_phase(m, phase, z)` for the world under study.

3. Weight constraints

   * For each redshift `z`, phase weights satisfy:

     ```txt
     w_phase(phase, z) >= w_phase_min > 0
     sum over phases of w_phase(phase, z) = 1
     ```

     where `w_phase_min` is a design-time constant that does not depend on world data.

   * Combination weights used later for tension functionals satisfy design-time bounds:

     ```txt
     alpha >= alpha_min > 0
     beta  >= beta_min > 0
     ```

     and neither `alpha` nor `beta` is allowed to depend on the particular world or data set.

4. Encoding-level invariance

   * The functional form of `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, and the combination rule into `Tension_MB` is fixed at the level of encoding design for Q049 and cannot be changed after inspecting the numerical outcomes in a given world.
   * Transformations of encodings inside `E_adm` that preserve the above properties are allowed. Any mapping that chooses `f_ref`, `alpha`, `beta`, or `w_phase` in response to the observed `f_phase(m, phase, z)` or to specific world data is considered outside `E_adm`.

These constraints ensure that tension measures cannot be trivially driven to zero by retroactively fitting reference partitions or weights to match the data.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor components

We define an effective combined mismatch:

```txt
DeltaS_total(m, z) =
    alpha * DeltaS_baryon(m, z) + beta * DeltaS_phase(m, z)
```

where:

* `alpha > 0` and `beta > 0` are fixed constants chosen at design time within the admissible encoding class and satisfy the lower bounds stated in Block 3.3,
* `DeltaS_total(m, z) >= 0` for all `m` and `z`.

Following the TU core decision for thermodynamic_tension nodes, we define an effective tension tensor:

```txt
T_ij(m, z) = S_i(m, z) * C_j(m, z) * DeltaS_total(m, z) * lambda(m, z) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m, z)` represents the strength of the i-th semantic or physical source component, for example how strongly a particular environment or phase enters the analysis.
* `C_j(m, z)` represents the sensitivity of the j-th cognitive or downstream component to baryon-distribution mismatches, for example predictive models or AI agents that rely on baryon budgets.
* `lambda(m, z)` is a convergence-state factor that encodes whether local reasoning or modeling is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic. It takes values inside a bounded interval specified in TU core charters.
* `kappa` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of baryon-distribution thermodynamic_tension in this encoding.

The indexing sets for `i` and `j` are not specified at the effective layer. It is sufficient that for each `m` and `z`, `T_ij(m, z)` is well defined and finite for all relevant indices.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some observables may become undefined or unreliable if data coverage is too poor or if an encoding is inconsistent. For a given redshift bin `z`, we define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing(z) = {
  m in M :
  Omega_b_obs(m, z) is undefined or not finite
  or DeltaS_baryon(m, z) is undefined
  or DeltaS_phase(m, z) is undefined
}
```

We then restrict attention to the regular subset:

```txt
M_reg(z) = M \ S_sing(z)
```

Rules:

* All tension analysis for Q049 at redshift `z` is performed only on states `m` in `M_reg(z)`.
* If an attempted evaluation of `DeltaS_baryon` or `DeltaS_phase` encounters a state in `S_sing(z)`, the result is recorded as out of domain and is not interpreted as evidence for or against any cosmological model or encoding choice within TU.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q049 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer. Within the TU taxonomy, Q049 is a thermodynamic_tension node for a conserved quantity partitioned across phases and environments.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

We define a baryon-budget tension functional:

```txt
Tension_MB(m, z) =
    alpha * DeltaS_baryon(m, z) + beta * DeltaS_phase(m, z)
```

with the same `alpha` and `beta` as in Block 3.4. This functional satisfies:

```txt
Tension_MB(m, z) >= 0 for all m in M_reg(z)
Tension_MB(m, z) = 0 only if
  Omega_b_obs(m, z) = Omega_b_true and
  f_phase(m, phase, z) = f_ref(phase, z) for all phases
```

The numerical values of `alpha` and `beta` are part of the encoding design for Q049. They are fixed ahead of any particular experiment, within the admissible encoding class `E_adm`, and do not depend on which world or data set is being analyzed.

### 4.2 Missing baryons as a low-tension principle

At the effective layer, a resolved missing baryons world is one in which:

* For relevant redshift bins and environments, there exist world-representing states `m` in `M_reg(z)` such that

  ```txt
  Tension_MB(m, z) <= epsilon_MB(z)
  ```

  where `epsilon_MB(z)` is a small design-time threshold that reflects observational uncertainties and modeling limitations at that redshift.

* As data quality and coverage improve, `epsilon_MB(z)` may be refined, but design choices ensure that `epsilon_MB(z)` does not grow without bound purely because more reliable information is added.

* Phase partitions and global baryon budgets remain jointly compatible with early-universe constraints within these low-tension bands for at least one admissible encoding in `E_adm`.

In this view, resolving the missing baryons problem means showing that the universe admits low-tension configurations across the relevant redshift range for some encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm` that satisfies the fairness constraints.

### 4.3 Persistent missing baryons as high tension

Conversely, a persistent missing baryons world is one in which:

* For any encoding rule `enc` in `E_adm` and for any reasonable refinement of observational data, there are redshift bins or environments where world-representing states `m` in `M_reg(z)` satisfy

  ```txt
  Tension_MB(m, z) >= delta_MB(z)
  ```

  for some strictly positive design-time threshold `delta_MB(z)` that cannot be reduced below a small chosen value without introducing inconsistency with early-universe constraints or with observed data.

* The high-tension behavior is not localized to isolated data artifacts. It persists under:

  * improved measurements within the same observational strategy,
  * independent observational methods targeting the same reservoirs,
  * different choices of reference phase partitions drawn from the predefined menu `F_ref_menu(z)`.

At the effective layer, Q049 asks whether the universe belongs to a low-tension baryon-budget world or to a world where a nontrivial fraction of baryons remains permanently hidden in ways that resist reconciliation.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline two counterfactual worlds, described strictly through observable patterns and tension behaviors:

* World T: missing baryons effectively resolved.
* World F: missing baryons real and persistent.

Both worlds are described in terms of effective observables and `Tension_MB` values for encoding rules in `E_adm`. They do not describe or assume any TU-generative rules.

### 5.1 World T (resolved baryons, low tension)

In World T:

1. Global budget closure

   * For each redshift bin within a chosen range, for example `0 <= z <= 2`, there exist states `m_T(z)` in `M_reg(z)` and encoding rules `enc` in `E_adm` such that

     ```txt
     DeltaS_baryon(m_T, z) is small and stable
     ```

     when data are refined and combined across independent surveys.

2. Phase-partition compatibility

   * Phase mismatch `DeltaS_phase(m_T, z)` remains within narrow bands compatible with at least one reference partition `f_ref` in `F_ref_menu(z)`.

3. Multi-scale stability

   * When the environment partition is refined, for example by splitting halos into mass bins or filaments into density bins, the aggregated `Tension_MB(m_T, z)` remains in a low band, up to expected fluctuations from sampling and systematics.

4. No unexplained high-tension pockets

   * Any local high tension in `Tension_MB` can be traced to identifiable systematics, inadequate modeling, or clearly incomplete surveys, and it decreases as those issues are resolved.

### 5.2 World F (persistent missing baryons, high tension)

In World F:

1. Budget gap

   * There exist redshift bins and environments such that, for all encoding rules `enc` in `E_adm` and realistic data refinements, any world-representing state `m_F(z)` in `M_reg(z)` satisfies

     ```txt
     DeltaS_baryon(m_F, z) >= delta_b > 0
     ```

     where `delta_b` is a strictly positive design-time threshold representing a significant fraction of the total baryon budget.

2. Systematic phase mismatch

   * For certain phases or environments, `DeltaS_phase(m_F, z)` does not converge toward any reference partition in `F_ref_menu(z)` even when observational completeness `C_obs` increases.

3. Robust high-tension regions

   * The tension functional `Tension_MB(m_F, z)` retains a high baseline for specific redshift and environment ranges. This high-tension pattern remains under multi instrument and multi method observational campaigns that are considered reasonable within the design of `E_adm`.

4. Hidden-reservoir inference pressure

   * Any attempt to reduce `Tension_MB(m_F, z)` within `E_adm` forces the introduction of new, poorly constrained phases or mechanisms that themselves remain tension heavy in other parts of the data space. In that case, Q049 registers a shift in where the tension resides rather than a genuine resolution.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not assume or construct any internal TU generative rules. They describe how observable baryon budgets and phase partitions behave, and how the resulting tension measures respond, if the missing baryons problem is effectively resolved or if it remains fundamentally unresolved. Q049 does not assert which kind of world we inhabit.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols at the effective layer that can:

* test the coherence of the Q049 encoding,
* distinguish between different baryon-budget tension models,
* falsify specific encoding choices for `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, and `Tension_MB`.

These experiments do not decide the ultimate truth of cosmological models. They can only reject particular TU encodings for Q049.

Design-time thresholds used in this block, such as tolerance levels and separation scores, are chosen before looking at the specific numerical outcomes of the world and are documented as part of the experimental protocol.

### Experiment 1: Low redshift baryon census tension scan

*Goal:*
Test whether a specific choice of `Tension_MB` encoding produces stable and interpretable tension profiles when applied to existing low redshift baryon census data.

*Setup:*

* Input data:

  * Published estimates of baryon content in different phases, such as stars, cold gas, hot intracluster medium, warm hot intergalactic medium, circumgalactic medium, and other diffuse components, for redshift bins in the range `0 <= z <= 1`.
  * Corresponding estimates of observational completeness for each phase.

* Choose at design time:

  * A fixed value of `Omega_b_true` from a standard cosmic microwave background analysis under a specified cosmological model.
  * A fixed reference phase partition `f_ref(phase, z)` from a selected element of `F_ref_menu(z)`.
  * Fixed weights `alpha`, `beta`, and `w_phase(phase, z)` within the admissible encoding class, satisfying the lower bounds in Block 3.3.
  * A tolerance profile `epsilon_MB_design(z)` describing the expected low-tension band for each redshift and a sensitivity tolerance `DeltaT_tol(z)` that bounds how much `Tension_MB` is allowed to vary under small admissible changes in `f_ref` or `w_phase`.

*Protocol:*

1. For each redshift bin `z` with available data, construct an effective state `m_data(z)` in `M_reg(z)` encoding:

   * `Omega_b_obs(m_data, z)`
   * `f_phase(m_data, phase, z)`
   * `C_obs(m_data, phase, z)`

2. Compute:

   * `DeltaS_baryon(m_data, z)`
   * `DeltaS_phase(m_data, z)`
   * `Tension_MB(m_data, z)`

3. Record the set of tension values across all `z`, along with the associated completeness indicators. Build a profile:

   ```txt
   T_profile(z) = Tension_MB(m_data, z)
   ```

4. Optionally repeat the procedure with alternative but still admissible choices of `f_ref` from `F_ref_menu(z)` to test robustness, keeping `alpha`, `beta`, and `w_phase` fixed.

5. For each redshift bin, compute a sensitivity measure:

   ```txt
   DeltaT_MB(z) = max over admissible f_ref in F_ref_menu(z)
                  |Tension_MB_f_ref(m_data, z) - Tension_MB_baseline(m_data, z)|
   ```

   where `Tension_MB_baseline(m_data, z)` is defined as `Tension_MB(m_data, z)` evaluated using the initial reference partition chosen in step 4, and `Tension_MB_f_ref(m_data, z)` denotes `Tension_MB(m_data, z)` evaluated with a candidate reference partition `f_ref` drawn from `F_ref_menu(z)`.

*Metrics:*

* Distribution of `Tension_MB(m_data, z)` over redshift.
* Correlation of `Tension_MB(m_data, z)` with `C_obs(m_data, phase, z)` aggregated over phases, for example whether high tension is always associated with very low completeness.
* Sensitivity of `Tension_MB` to changes in `f_ref` within `F_ref_menu(z)`, summarized by `DeltaT_MB(z)`.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If for a substantial subset of redshift bins, `DeltaT_MB(z)` exceeds the design-time sensitivity tolerance `DeltaT_tol(z)` in generic and non interpretive ways, the current definition of `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, or the choice of combination weights is considered unstable and rejected for Q049.
* If `Tension_MB(m_data, z)` is either nearly zero across all redshifts or extremely large in ways that cannot be traced to data completeness, known systematics, or clearly documented reference choices, the encoding is flagged as misaligned and subject to revision.
* If small, justified changes in modeling within `E_adm` result in tension profiles that contradict basic physical expectations, for example by labeling obviously incomplete surveys as low tension while classifying more complete surveys as systematically high tension, the encoding is considered falsified.

*Semantics implementation note:*
This experiment treats all quantities as continuous-field summaries consistent with the metadata declaration. It does not introduce discrete or hybrid reinterpretations within this block.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a TU encoding for Q049 does not solve the canonical missing baryons problem. This experiment can reject specific tension encodings but cannot by itself determine whether the cosmological missing baryons problem is fully resolved.

---

### Experiment 2: Simulation versus observation cross-tension

*Goal:*
Assess whether the Q049 encoding can distinguish, in a stable and interpretable way, between baryon distributions predicted by simulations and those inferred from observations, without being overwhelmed by trivial systematics.

*Setup:*

* Input data:

  * A set of hydrodynamical cosmological simulation snapshots providing phase-resolved baryon distributions at selected redshifts.
  * A matching set of observational baryon census data for similar redshift ranges and environments.

* Use the same `Omega_b_true`, reference phase partition `f_ref` from `F_ref_menu(z)`, and weights `alpha`, `beta`, `w_phase` as in Experiment 1, within the admissible encoding class `E_adm`.

* Predefine a separation metric and threshold:

  * For each redshift `z`, define

    ```txt
    S_sep(z) = P( Tension_MB(m_sim, z) < Tension_MB(m_obs, z) )
    ```

    where the probability is taken over simulation snapshots and matched observational samples.
  * Choose a design-time threshold `S_sep_min(z)` that represents a meaningful separation level between simulation and observation in tension space for the specific experiment.

*Protocol:*

1. For each chosen redshift `z`, construct:

   * states `m_sim(z)` representing simulation-based phase partitions and total baryon budgets,
   * states `m_obs(z)` representing observation-based phase partitions and total baryon budgets.
     Both types of states must be built by encoding rules in `E_adm`.

2. Compute `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, and `Tension_MB` for both `m_sim(z)` and `m_obs(z)`.

3. For each redshift, estimate `S_sep(z)` using the joint distribution of `Tension_MB(m_sim, z)` and `Tension_MB(m_obs, z)`.

4. Optionally vary aspects of simulation physics, for example feedback strength, to see how tension profiles and `S_sep(z)` shift.

5. Throughout the experiment, the labels "simulation" and "observation" are assigned based on data provenance alone. They are never inferred or redefined based on tension values.

*Metrics:*

* Differences between `Tension_MB(m_sim, z)` and `Tension_MB(m_obs, z)` across redshifts and environments.
* The separation metric `S_sep(z)` and its behavior compared with the design-time thresholds `S_sep_min(z)`.
* Sensitivity of tension differences to changes in simulation parameters, summarized by changes in `S_sep(z)` and in the distribution of tension values.
* Robustness of tension differences under admissible changes of `f_ref` within the same simulation family.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If under reasonable encoding choices within `E_adm`, the estimated `S_sep(z)` remains close to one half across redshifts, so that simulations and observations are not distinguishable by `Tension_MB` even when known discrepancies exist in the underlying data, the encoding is considered too insensitive and rejected for Q049.
* If small, physically unmotivated adjustments to encoding parameters or to the choice of `f_ref` inside `F_ref_menu(z)` can arbitrarily flip which side (simulation or observation) appears more tension heavy in generic settings, the encoding is considered unstable and rejected.
* If `S_sep(z)` exceeds `S_sep_min(z)` only for encodings that implicitly use knowledge of which samples are simulations or observations, for example by tuning parameters separately for each family, the encoding is considered to violate the fairness constraints of `E_adm` and is rejected.

*Semantics implementation note:*
Both simulations and observations are reduced to the same type of continuous-field summaries before computing tension. This preserves consistency with the declared `Field_type` and semantics.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a TU encoding for Q049 does not determine whether simulations or observations are closer to the true universe. It only tests whether the tension functional is suitable for discriminating structured differences between them.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q049 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer. All training signals and architectural patterns described here operate on effective-layer summaries and tension indicators only. They do not access or expose any TU-generative rules or hidden microphysical states.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that can be used as auxiliary objectives or diagnostics.

1. `signal_baryon_budget_consistency`

   * Definition:

     ```txt
     signal_baryon_budget_consistency(m, z) =
         DeltaS_baryon(m, z)
     ```

   * Purpose: penalize internal states or outputs that imply baryon budgets strongly inconsistent with `Omega_b_true` when the context assumes a standard cosmological model.

2. `signal_phase_partition_stability`

   * Definition:

     ```txt
     signal_phase_partition_stability(m, z) =
         DeltaS_phase(m, z)
     ```

   * Purpose: encourage internal representations that yield phase partitions compatible with the chosen reference patterns when such compatibility is part of the assumed background.

3. `signal_missing_reservoir_flag`

   * Definition:

     ```txt
     signal_missing_reservoir_flag(m, z) =
         1 if Tension_MB(m, z) >= tau_MB
         0 otherwise
     ```

     where `tau_MB` is a design-time threshold chosen to represent a significant baryon-budget tension.

   * Purpose: flag contexts where the model should explicitly acknowledge missing reservoirs or limited observational coverage instead of inventing unsupported reservoirs.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that can reuse Q049 structures without exposing any TU deep generative rules.

1. `CosmicBudgetTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal embedding of a cosmology-related context, produce estimates of `DeltaS_baryon`, `DeltaS_phase`, and `Tension_MB` as auxiliary outputs.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal embeddings representing the current cosmological scenario or explanation.
     * Outputs: scalar estimates `DeltaS_baryon_hat`, `DeltaS_phase_hat`, `Tension_MB_hat` and optional uncertainty ranges.

2. `PhasePartitionObserver`

   * Role: extract coarse phase-partition features, for example approximate fractions in stars, gas, warm hot intergalactic medium, circumgalactic medium, from text or data representations.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: context embeddings and optional structured inputs describing environments.
     * Outputs: a vector of phase fraction estimates that can be fed into tension heads or consistency filters.

3. `MissingReservoirDetector`

   * Role: monitor tension outputs and decide when answers should include explicit statements about observational incompleteness or unresolved reservoirs.
   * Interface:

     * Inputs: `Tension_MB_hat` and data completeness indicators if present.
     * Outputs: a control signal that modulates answer templates, for example adding phrases such as “current observations are incomplete” or “a significant fraction of baryons may reside in difficult-to-detect phases”.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We suggest an evaluation harness to test AI systems augmented with Q049-aware modules.

1. Task selection

   * Construct a set of questions and multi-step prompts about:

     * cosmic baryon census,
     * roles of warm hot intergalactic medium and circumgalactic medium,
     * comparison between early-universe baryon density and low redshift observations.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition: the model answers questions without any explicit `CosmicBudgetTensionHead` or `MissingReservoirDetector`.
   * TU condition: the same base model uses these modules and their signals as auxiliary guidance.

3. Metrics

   * Scientific coherence: consistency of baryon budget numbers and phase descriptions across multiple questions and follow-up prompts.
   * Acknowledgment of uncertainty: frequency with which the model correctly indicates incomplete observational coverage instead of overstating precision.
   * Cross-question stability: whether the model maintains a consistent narrative about where baryons reside and how certain that knowledge is.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the practical impact of Q049 encoding.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain the missing baryons problem, list main baryon components at low redshift, and comment on their relative importance.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation is vague about phases, ignores diffuse components such as warm hot intergalactic medium and circumgalactic medium, is inconsistent about the baryon budget, or is overconfident about having completely solved the problem.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same question, but with an additional instruction to the AI to:

    * use a baryon-budget tension score as an internal check,
    * explicitly identify any phases or environments where tension remains high or data are incomplete.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation becomes more structured, with clear mention of known reservoirs, data gaps, and unresolved issues.

* Comparison metric

  * Use a rubric for:

    * completeness of phase listing,
    * correctness of qualitative statements about each reservoir,
    * explicit handling of uncertainty and missing data.

* What to log

  * Prompts, responses, and any associated auxiliary tension estimates.
  * This allows independent reviewers to check whether the model behavior changes in ways consistent with the Q049 tension framing.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q049 and how they transfer to other problems. All transfer happens at the effective layer. No TU-generative rules are shared.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `CosmicBudgetTensionScore_MB`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       Omega_b_true
       Omega_b_obs
       {f_phase(phase)}
       {w_phase(phase)}
     Output:
       tension_value = Tension_MB
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs describe a consistent baryon census for a given redshift bin and environment partition.
     * Phase fractions and weights sum appropriately and are taken from the admissible encoding class `E_adm`.

2. ComponentName: `PhasePartitionFieldDescriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       environment_descriptor
       redshift z
     Output:
       phase_fraction_vector
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * Environments are described at a coarse-grained level, for example halo mass bins, filament versus void, cluster versus field.
     * Phase fractions form a valid vector, entries lie between 0 and 1, and the sum is less than or equal to 1.

3. ComponentName: `MissingReservoirWorldTemplate`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs:
       model_class
     Outputs:
       World_T_pattern
       World_F_pattern
       tension_evaluation_protocol
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The model class admits a partition of a conserved quantity, for example baryons, energy, carbon, or pathogen population, into observable and potentially hidden reservoirs.
     * A notion of global budget and phase partitions is available at the effective layer.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q047 (Origin of supermassive black holes)

   * Reused component: `PhasePartitionFieldDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: supermassive black hole growth requires knowledge of gas and baryon availability in halos and filaments, which can be summarized by the phase partition descriptor.
   * What changes: environments include specific halo mass and redshift ranges relevant to black hole seeding and early accretion.

2. Q048 (Hubble constant tension)

   * Reused component: `CosmicBudgetTensionScore_MB`.
   * Why it transfers: distance ladder and baryon acoustic oscillation based H0 inferences depend on baryon acoustic signatures and baryon distribution, which can be cross checked using the same tension score.
   * What changes: focus shifts to how baryon distribution affects calibration of observables entering the H0 analysis. `Tension_MB` becomes one of several inputs to an H0 consistency functional.

3. Q091 (Equilibrium climate sensitivity)

   * Reused component: `MissingReservoirWorldTemplate`.
   * Why it transfers: climate problems also involve potentially hidden reservoirs, such as deep ocean heat and soil carbon, and incomplete coverage. The template can be reused with different observables and compartments.
   * What changes: the conserved quantity becomes heat or carbon rather than baryon number, and phase labels are climate relevant rather than cosmological.

4. Q100 (Environmental drivers of pandemic risk)

   * Reused component: `MissingReservoirWorldTemplate`.
   * Why it transfers: pathogen reservoirs and surveillance gaps can be encoded as hidden versus observed compartments, analogous to missing baryon reservoirs.
   * What changes: the model class and phases are epidemiological rather than cosmological. The same concept of persistent budget tension is applied to infection and reservoir data.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q049 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective-layer encoding of the missing baryons problem has been specified:

    * state space and observables,
    * mismatch measures `DeltaS_baryon` and `DeltaS_phase`,
    * a combined tension functional `Tension_MB`,
    * an admissible encoding class `E_adm` with fairness constraints,
    * and a singular set with domain restrictions.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative linking early-universe baryon budgets, low redshift phase partitions, and hidden reservoirs is explicit and internally consistent but still at an outline level.
  * Counterfactual worlds and experiments are specified but have not yet been instantiated with concrete numerical protocols based on specific data compilations.

These definitions of E1 and N1 are consistent with other TU nodes. Higher levels will require implemented tools and published benchmarks.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented:

1. A concrete implementation of `Tension_MB` that operates on published baryon census compilations, providing open tension profiles as a function of redshift and environment along with documented choices of `Omega_b_true`, `f_ref`, and weights.
2. A comparative study where several candidate phase partitions and reference models inside `F_ref_menu(z)` are tested within the admissible encoding class, with results documented so that independent groups can reproduce and challenge them.
3. An AI evaluation harness, as described in Block 7.3, deployed on a benchmark set of cosmology questions, with before versus after analysis of how baryon-budget reasoning changes under Q049-aware training signals.

All of these steps respect the effective-layer boundary because they operate on observable summaries and documented reference models only.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q049 is expected to serve as:

* The canonical hidden-reservoir node for cosmology, illustrating how thermodynamic_tension on conserved quantities is used when observations are incomplete.
* A template for constructing and testing similar encodings in other domains that face missing-reservoir problems, such as climate, ecology, and epidemiology.
* A calibration point for AI systems that must reason about global budgets, reservoirs, and observational gaps without overstating certainty or inventing unsupported components.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non experts, while still aligned with the effective-layer description.

Cosmology tells us, from early-universe physics, how many baryons the universe should contain. That total amount is encoded in a number called `Omega_b_true`. It comes from careful analysis of the cosmic microwave background and of nuclear reactions in the first minutes after the big bang.

Later in cosmic history, we can look around and try to count where those baryons actually are:

* in stars,
* in gas inside galaxies,
* in very hot gas inside clusters of galaxies,
* in more diffuse material between galaxies and around galaxies.

When astronomers add up all those pieces, they do not always get back the total that early-universe physics says should be there. The missing baryons problem is simply the question:

> In which phases and environments do the missing baryons hide, and how sure are we about our current census?

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to build a new cosmological model or solve the detailed astrophysics inside this entry. Instead, we:

1. Represent each possible world configuration as a state that summarizes:

   * how many baryons are counted in each phase,
   * how complete the observations are for each phase.
2. Compare two things in each such state:

   * the total baryon density we infer from observations at late times,
   * the total baryon density predicted by early-universe physics.
3. Measure how much tension there is between:

   * the global budget from early-universe probes,
   * the phase-resolved census at later times.

This tension is encoded in a number we call `Tension_MB`. It is:

* small when observations and models agree on where the baryons are, within reasonable uncertainties,
* large when there is a significant shortfall or a very unusual phase distribution.

We then imagine two types of worlds:

* In a resolved world, as we gather better data and combine different observations, the tension stays small and stable. The missing baryons problem becomes an accounting exercise that we can close.
* In a persistent world, even with improved data, tension remains high in specific redshift ranges or environments. We are forced to conclude that there are reservoirs we have not yet understood, or that our models of how baryons move between phases are incomplete.

Q049, in this framework, does not claim to answer where every baryon is. It provides:

* a precise way to talk about how well we are doing with the baryon census,
* a set of observables and experiments for testing different encodings of missing baryons tension,
* components that can be reused in other problems where a conserved quantity seems to be missing from the obvious places.

All of this is kept at the effective layer. We work with what can be observed, summarized, and compared, without exposing or relying on any hidden generative rules of the Tension Universe itself.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the WFGY / Tension Universe S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective-layer encoding of the named problem Q049 within the Tension Universe framework.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It must not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved. It should be cited, if at all, as an encoding and engineering specification.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here, including the state space `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds, and experiment patterns, live at the effective layer of Tension Universe.
* No statement in this document should be read as a claim about ultimate microscopic dynamics, ontological commitments, or new fundamental physics.
* Any implementation of this encoding, whether as software tools, AI modules, or numerical pipelines, can be revised or replaced based on experimental feedback without changing the status of this effective-layer specification.

### Relation to TU charters

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

These charters define the global rules for what counts as an admissible effective-layer encoding, how fairness and invariance must be handled, and how tension scores are interpreted across the Tension Universe program.
