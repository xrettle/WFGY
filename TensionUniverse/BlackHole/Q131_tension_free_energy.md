## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is confined to the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* This document defines an effective-layer encoding of free energy in terms of:

  * state spaces,
  * observables,
  * tension functionals,
  * and falsifiable invariants.
* It does **not** modify, extend, or challenge the canonical laws of thermodynamics:

  * conservation of energy for closed descriptions,
  * nonnegative total entropy production for physically realistic processes,
  * standard free energy inequalities for work extraction.
* It does **not** claim to:

  * prove or disprove any open problem in thermodynamics,
  * introduce new fundamental physical laws,
  * demonstrate physically real devices that outperform established limits.

The mapping

```txt
(raw experimental or design data) -> (effective state m in M)
```

is treated as part of an **encoding instance** of Q131, not as physics itself.
Different encoding instances can be:

* proposed,
* tested,
* falsified,
* and replaced,

without changing the underlying physical laws.

Falsification in this document always means:

> A particular encoding instance in the admissible class for Q131 fails to account for data while respecting the invariants.

It does **not** mean that thermodynamics is wrong.

Block 0 (this header and disclaimer) records global metadata and the effective-layer boundary that every Q131 encoding must respect.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Classical problem statement

In classical and modern thermodynamics, "free energy" is the portion of a system's energy that can be converted into useful work under specified environmental constraints.

For a system in contact with an environment treated as an ideal reservoir with fixed temperature and pressure parameters `(T_env, p_env)`, standard equilibrium free energy quantities include:

```txt
Helmholtz free energy:  F = U - T_env * S        (fixed T_env, fixed volume/constraint as appropriate)
Gibbs free energy:      G = U + p_env * V - T_env * S   (fixed T_env, fixed p_env)
```

Applicability note (effective-layer boundary):

* The expressions above are classical equilibrium definitions.
* In nonequilibrium open-system settings, the effective-layer encoding must either:

  * include enough environment slices so that the state `m` makes the corresponding free energy functional a well-defined state functional on `M_reg`, or
  * use an explicitly declared nonequilibrium free-energy-like functional (availability / exergy style) chosen from a fixed library in Section 3.8.

For a generic process that starts at state `x_initial` and ends at state `x_final`, a maximum work inequality can be written in the form:

```txt
W_out_max <= F(x_initial) - F(x_final)
```

or, under appropriate constraints,

```txt
W_out_max <= G(x_initial) - G(x_final)
```

Cycle note (avoid ambiguity):

* For a strict cycle where the *entire effective closed description* returns to the same state, the free energy difference is zero and net work extraction must be accounted for by changes in the explicitly modeled reservoirs or imported resources.
* In practical engine cycles, the working medium can return to its initial internal state while the reservoirs change; this is represented in Q131 by including reservoir slices inside the effective state `m`.

The canonical problem behind Q131 is:

> Given an open system immersed in one or more reservoirs, and given nonequilibrium structure and information in those reservoirs, what are the sharp limits on extractable work and efficiency, and how can these limits be expressed as tension-style invariants and observables?

Q131 explicitly excludes any violation of:

* conservation of energy for closed descriptions, and
* nonnegative total entropy production for physically realistic processes.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The core laws of thermodynamics are well established and experimentally confirmed. There exist:

* mature formulations of equilibrium free energy,
* extended frameworks for nonequilibrium thermodynamics,
* information-theoretic treatments linking work and information processing.

However, several aspects remain nontrivial.

1. Unified treatment of structural resources

   * Real systems exploit not only temperature and pressure gradients, but also:

     * chemical gradients,
     * concentration differences,
     * spatial and temporal correlations,
     * and information encoded in control structures.
   * A fully unified "resource theory of free energy" for arbitrary open systems is still under active development.

2. Operational bounds under complex constraints

   * For realistic engineering systems, including computation,

     * computing tight bounds on extractable work,
     * under constraints on control, measurement, and feedback,

       is technically difficult and often problem specific.

3. Integration with computation and learning

   * For AI and computing systems, relating:

     * algorithmic structure,
     * representation complexity,
     * and physical energy cost,

       in a way that gives usable design rules, remains partially open.

The Tension Universe formulation in Q131 does not claim to solve these open directions.
Instead, it reframes them into a common language of:

* tension fields,
* free_energy_tension functionals,
* and explicit energy and entropy invariants.

Within this entry, the metadata value

```txt
Status: Reframed_only
```

means:

> Q131 currently provides an effective-layer reframing and a falsifiable encoding of free energy questions.
> It does not introduce new predictive laws beyond mainstream thermodynamics and does not claim any resolution of canonical open problems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q131 plays three roles.

1. **Physical sanity check for TU**

   It demonstrates that TU-style tension encodings can reproduce standard free energy limits without breaking conservation or the second law.

2. **Bridge between physics and AI energy limits**

   It provides the physical side of the link to AI and computation problems such as:

   * Q059 (information thermodynamics in computation),
   * Q129 and Q130 (energy limits for AI).

3. **Classifier for "free energy" claims**

   It defines effective-layer criteria that separate:

   * coherent open-system energy-harvesting architectures, from
   * perpetual motion style designs that rely on hidden reservoirs or missing entropy accounting.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q131 sits in the BlackHole graph among Q001–Q130.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

Upstream nodes provide foundations, tools, or conceptual scaffolding that Q131 reuses.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Supplies the general thermodynamic and quantum thermodynamic framework for energy, entropy, and work observables used in Q131.

* Q035 (BH_PHYS_QMETROLOGY_LIMIT_L3_035)
  Reason: Provides limit concepts for precision measurement of tiny energy and heat flows, supporting the practical meaning of Q131's invariants.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Supplies information-thermodynamic accounting primitives that Q131 can embed into an open-system ledger.

* Q129 (BH_AI_ENERGY_LIMIT_L3_129)
  Reason: Provides high-level energy-limit targets for AI systems; Q131 supplies the physical accounting layer.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

Downstream nodes reuse Q131 components or treat Q131 as a prerequisite.

* Q130 (BH_AI_OOD_ENERGY_LIMIT_L3_130)
  Reason: Reuses Q131 components defined in Section 8.1, specifically `FreeEnergyTensionFunctional` and `EnergyEntropyLedger`, under Q130's interpretation layer.

* Future node: "Self-maintaining open systems under tension"
  Reason: Will reuse Q131's open-system state space and free_energy_tension invariants to study persistent far-from-equilibrium structures.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* Q036 (BH_PHYS_HIGH_TC_MECH_L3_036)
  Reason: Both Q036 and Q131 analyze emergent phases and resource-like order parameters as structured tension in many-body systems.

* Q040 (BH_PHYS_QBLACKHOLE_INFO_L3_040)
  Reason: Both study how energy, entropy, and information interact under strong constraints, one in condensed matter and the other in gravitational systems.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross-domain edges connect Q131 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Q059 can reuse Q131 component interfaces defined in Section 8.1, specifically `EnergyEntropyLedger`, while Q059 supplies upstream semantics for information-cost terms.

* Q130 (BH_AI_OOD_ENERGY_LIMIT_L3_130)
  Reason: Uses Q131's free_energy_tension concept and the ledger invariants under a compute-budget interpretation.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Can reuse Q131's idea of mapping internal representations to resource-like tension fields, interpreted as cost and constraint ledgers.

Graph hygiene note:

* Edge direction is component-interface oriented.
* When a node is both upstream conceptually and cross-domain reusable, the reuse is restricted to named interfaces in Section 8.1 and does not imply circular dependence on definitions.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays strictly at the effective layer.
We only define:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

No hidden generative rules or mappings from raw experimental data to internal TU fields are described.
Those belong to the encoding class defined in Section 3.8.

### 3.1 State space of open tension-energy configurations

We define a state space `M` whose elements are effective descriptions of open systems interacting with environments.

Each state `m` in `M` encodes, at some finite resolution:

1. A finite set of reservoirs

   ```txt
   R = { R_1, R_2, ..., R_n }
   ```

   For each reservoir `R_k`, the state includes effective ledger variables such as:

   ```txt
   U_k(m)   ledger-defined effective internal energy contribution
   S_k(m)   ledger-defined effective entropy contribution
   V_k(m)   volume or analogous extensive variable (optional)
   other_k  other relevant extensive variables (optional)
   ```

   Ledger-defined note:

   * `U_k(m)` and `S_k(m)` are not assumed to be directly measurable as microscopic state variables.
   * They are effective-layer quantities computed from a fixed encoding instance `E` using observable flows and reservoir parameterizations.

2. A work storage subsystem `W_store`

   With an effective stored work quantity (energy in the storage subsystem):

   ```txt
   W_store(m) >= 0
   ```

3. A description of coupling channels

   A finite set `C_channels` describing how reservoirs and `W_store` can exchange energy and entropy, including:

   ```txt
   allowed_flows(m)
   control_patterns(m)
   ```

4. A tension field over the configuration

   An effective field `Tau_FE(m)` representing gradients and structure that can drive energy and entropy flows, for example:

   * temperature gradients,
   * chemical potential gradients,
   * concentration gradients,
   * structured correlations that act as resources.

We do not specify how `m` is constructed from underlying microstates or experimental data.
We assume only that each `m` provides well defined values for the observables introduced below under an encoding instance `E`.

We also assume a refinement ladder:

```txt
M_1 subset M_2 subset ... subset M_k subset ...
```

where `M_k` restricts:

* the number of reservoirs,
* the number of channels,
* and the resolution of `Tau_FE(m)`.

### 3.2 Energy and entropy observables

On `M` we define the following effective observables.

1. Total energy of the closed description

We require an explicit ledger partition. Define:

```txt
E_total(m) = E_res(m) + E_store(m) + E_aux(m)
```

where:

```txt
E_res(m)  = sum over k of U_k(m)
E_store(m)= W_store(m)
E_aux(m)  = other explicitly modeled energy terms, disjoint from U_k and W_store
```

Disjointness requirement:

* `E_aux(m)` must not double-count any energy already included in `U_k(m)` or `W_store(m)`.

2. Total entropy of the closed description

Define:

```txt
S_total(m) = S_res(m) + S_aux(m)
S_res(m)   = sum over k of S_k(m)
S_aux(m)   = entropy assigned to explicitly modeled environment slices and auxiliary subsystems
```

Closed-description requirement:

* For using second-law style inequalities in Section 3.6, the encoding instance must include enough environment slices so that unmodeled entropy sinks are not silently omitted.

3. Work output observable

Define the state-difference observable:

```txt
DeltaW_store(m; m_ref) = W_store(m) - W_store(m_ref)
```

where `m_ref` is the fixed reference state for the evaluation, chosen as the initial state `m_0`.

Define process-level extracted work:

```txt
W_out_total = W_store(m_T) - W_store(m_0)
```

Reference requirement:

* `m_0` is part of the run definition and cannot be changed after observing outcomes.

4. Heat exchanged with an environment slice `E_env_j`

```txt
Q_env_j(m)
```

for each environment slice that is represented explicitly.

Regularity requirement:

```txt
E_total(m) is finite
S_total(m) is finite
```

for all `m` in the regular domain described below.

### 3.3 Free energy and free_energy_tension observables

We define an effective free energy observable `F_free(m)` as a function of:

* the ledger energies `U_k(m)`,
* the ledger entropies `S_k(m)`,
* and relevant environment parameters included in `m`, such as effective temperature or pressure fields.

Example (single reservoir parameterization):

```txt
F_free(m) = U_1(m) - T_env(m) * S_1(m)
```

State-functional requirement:

* In nonequilibrium settings, `F_free(m)` must be chosen so it is a well-defined function on `M_reg` under the encoding instance `E`.
* If the functional requires reservoir parameters, those parameters must be included in the effective state `m` as part of the modeled environment slices.

We then define a free energy tension observable:

```txt
Tension_FE(m) >= 0
```

Unit convention (effective-layer):

* `Tension_FE(m)` is defined as an energy-like scalar (units of energy) under the default Q131 library.
* If an encoding instance uses a different unit convention, it must declare a conversion to energy units to preserve invariant consistency.

Intended meaning:

* `Tension_FE(m)` measures how much structured resource remains that can, in principle, be converted into work, given the couplings encoded in `C_channels`.

We require that:

1. If no gradients, structure, or disequilibria remain in `m`, then

   ```txt
   Tension_FE(m) = 0
   ```

2. For a process represented by a sequence of states

   ```txt
   m_0, m_1, ..., m_T
   ```

   with work extracted into `W_store`, we have an inequality of the form

   ```txt
   W_out_total <= F_free(m_0) - F_free(m_T)
   ```

3. Discrete process upper bound using tension

Define nonnegative step weights `alpha_t` with units of energy (or dimensionless with an explicit scale) fixed by the encoding instance:

```txt
alpha_t = alpha_E(m_{t-1}, m_t) >= 0
```

Then require a discrete bound:

```txt
W_out_total <= sum_{t=1..T} alpha_t * Tension_FE(m_{t-1})
```

This replaces any ambiguous continuous-time integral.
Any continuous-time variant is permitted only if the encoding instance defines a time parameterization and unit-consistent mapping to the discrete form above.

### 3.4 Information structure observables

We introduce two information-related observables.

1. Configuration information

```txt
I_config(m) >= 0
```

Unit declaration:

* `I_config(m)` is measured in bits by default.

2. Information processing cost lower bound

```txt
cost_info(m) >= 0
```

Units:

* `cost_info(m)` is an energy lower bound.

Constraint:

```txt
cost_info(m) <= k_info(m) * I_config(m)
```

where `k_info(m)` is an energy-per-bit coefficient determined by the encoding instance and environment slices represented in `m`.
Minimal conservative requirement:

```txt
k_info(m) >= k_B * T_eff(m) * ln(2)
```

when `T_eff(m)` is defined for the relevant erasure channel in the closed description.

This ensures that information is not treated as a free resource.
Any architecture that implicitly assumes unbounded work extraction from information with zero associated cost would violate this observable constraint.

### 3.5 Effective tension tensor (diagnostic object)

To align with TU core conventions, we define an effective diagnostic tensor:

```txt
T_ij(m) = Src_i(m) * Rcp_j(m) * Tension_FE(m) * Reg(m) * kappa
```

where:

* `Src_i(m)` are source-like dimensionless weights in `[0,1]`,
* `Rcp_j(m)` are receptivity-like dimensionless weights in `[0,1]`,
* `Reg(m)` is a regime indicator in `[0,1]` (effective control regime weight),
* `kappa` is a fixed scaling constant declared by the encoding instance.

Index-set requirement:

* The encoding instance must specify the index sets `{i}` and `{j}` for the tensor, for example a finite partition of channels or degrees of freedom.

Unit requirement:

* Under the default convention where `Tension_FE(m)` is energy-like, `T_ij(m)` is also energy-like up to the scale `kappa`.
* If the encoding instance chooses `kappa = 1`, `T_ij` has units of energy.

Consistency requirement:

```txt
Tension_FE(m) = 0  implies  T_ij(m) = 0 for all i, j
```

within the domain of interest.

### 3.6 Invariants and constraints

We define three effective invariants for a process represented by a sequence of states:

```txt
m_0, m_1, ..., m_T
```

We require the encoding instance to provide explicit ledgers for external exchanges.

1. Energy balance invariant

Define explicit external exchange ledger:

```txt
E_ext_total = E_ext_heat + E_ext_work + E_ext_matter
```

where each term must be computable from declared observables such as `Q_env_j` and any modeled work or matter injection channels.

Define:

```txt
I_E_balance = E_total(m_T) - E_total(m_0) - E_ext_total
```

A valid encoding should satisfy:

```txt
I_E_balance = 0
```

within modeling tolerance.

2. Entropy production invariant (closed description)

Define total entropy change of the closed description:

```txt
DeltaS_total = S_total(m_T) - S_total(m_0)
```

Closed-description requirement:

* The encoding instance must include sufficient environment slices so `S_total` accounts for entropy exported to modeled sinks.

Then require:

```txt
DeltaS_total >= 0
```

for physically realistic processes, within tolerance.

3. Free energy bound invariant

Define:

```txt
I_FE_bound = W_out_total - ( F_free(m_0) - F_free(m_T) )
```

A valid encoding must satisfy:

```txt
I_FE_bound <= 0
```

This ensures that work output never exceeds the decrease in the chosen free energy functional under the closed description modeled by `m`.

Non-equilibrium requirement:

* If `F_free` is not an equilibrium free energy, the encoding instance must declare its definition and make it a state functional on `M_reg`.

### 3.7 Singular set and domain restriction

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = {
  m in M :
  E_total(m) is undefined or not finite
  or S_total(m) is undefined or not finite
  or F_free(m) is undefined
  or Tension_FE(m) is undefined
  or I_config(m) is undefined
  or cost_info(m) is undefined
}
```

The regular domain is:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

All Q131 analysis is restricted to `M_reg`.
Any proposed "free energy" architecture that cannot be mapped to a well defined `m` in `M_reg` is treated as out of domain, not as evidence for new physics.

### 3.8 Admissible encoding class and fairness constraints

We define an admissible encoding class `Enc_Q131`.
Each element `E` in `Enc_Q131` specifies:

* a choice of refinement ladder

  ```txt
  M_1(E) subset M_2(E) subset ...
  ```

  that satisfies the structural requirements of Sections 3.1–3.7,

* a choice of free energy functional family

  ```txt
  F_free^E(m; theta_F)
  ```

  from a fixed, finite library of functional forms,

* a choice of free energy tension functional

  ```txt
  Tension_FE^E(m; theta_T)
  ```

  from a fixed, finite library,

* concrete update rules for an energy and entropy ledger that implement the invariants in Section 3.6,

* a mapping protocol schema `Map_E` that converts raw descriptions or data into `m` with a logged trace.

Library identity requirement (anti-retrofit):

* The functional libraries must be versioned and frozen for the evaluation scope.
* Minimal required declaration fields for any evaluation:

```txt
Library_ID_F: <string>
Library_ID_T: <string>
Library_hash: <hash string>
Map_schema_ID: <string>
Map_schema_hash: <hash string>
```

These identifiers are part of the evaluation record, fixed before test outcomes are inspected.

An encoding instance `E` in `Enc_Q131` must satisfy the following fairness and stability constraints.

1. **Precommitment**

   * For any experimental campaign or benchmark, `E` must be fixed **before** inspecting the detailed outcome of that campaign.
   * Parameter values such as `theta_F`, `theta_T`, and ledger tolerances can be tuned using a separate training set, but they cannot be adapted to individual test devices after observing their performance.
   * The definition of "tuned using a separate training set" must be recorded in the run log, including dataset identity.

2. **Non-adaptive use**

   * Within a given evaluation, the same encoding instance `E` must be used across all systems and devices in the scope of Q131.
   * It is not permitted to select one `E` for devices that behave well and another `E` for designs that would otherwise violate invariants, purely to avoid falsification.

3. **Refinement stability**

   * Along the refinement ladder, estimates of `E_total`, `S_total`, `F_free`, and `Tension_FE` must vary in a controlled way.

   * Define a macroscopic observable vector `Obs(m)` (chosen by the encoding instance) and a distance:

     ```txt
     d(m, m') = || Obs(m) - Obs(m') ||_1
     ```

   * Require a Lipschitz-style bound between neighboring refinement levels when macroscopic observables are held fixed within tolerance:

     ```txt
     | Tension_FE(m_k) - Tension_FE(m_{k+1}) | <= L_E * d(m_k, m_{k+1})
     ```

     where `L_E` is a constant fixed by the encoding instance and declared pre-run.

4. **Falsifiability and replacement**

   * If a high quality experiment or device analysis, performed with a fixed encoding instance `E` in `Enc_Q131`, robustly produces:

     * `I_E_balance` far from zero under the declared external ledger,
     * or `DeltaS_total < 0` for a closed description,
     * or `I_FE_bound > 0` without any modeled external structured resource,

       then `E` is considered falsified for Q131.
   * It is permitted to propose a new encoding instance `E'` in `Enc_Q131`, but `E'` must:

     * be specified independently of the falsifying dataset,
     * be subjected to fresh tests,
     * and remain bound by the same precommitment and non-adaptive rules.

In summary, `Enc_Q131` collects effective-layer encodings that are:

* structurally compatible with Sections 3.1–3.7,
* fixed in advance for any given test suite,
* and open to falsification without retroactive adjustment.

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q131 is characterized as a tension problem in TU.

### 4.1 Core principle

The core principle is:

> Free energy is structured tension in an open system that can be converted into work, up to hard limits set by energy conservation and entropy production, and these limits can be expressed as inequalities involving free_energy_tension and TU invariants.

Operationally, this means:

1. The free energy tension observable `Tension_FE(m)` measures how far the configuration `m` is from a relaxed state with no exploitable gradients or structure.

2. As work is extracted and entropy is produced, `Tension_FE(m)` should decrease, unless new structured resources are imported from external reservoirs.

3. Any claim of "free energy" gain must be representable as:

   * either import of structured resources that increase `Tension_FE(m)` from outside the modeled system, or
   * reallocation of tension between subsystems, subject to the global energy and entropy constraints.

### 4.2 Low-tension and high-tension regimes

We introduce two regimes for world-representing states in `M_reg`.

Band schema requirement:

* Any concrete evaluation must declare thresholds `(tau_low, tau_high)` as part of encoding instance `E`.

Define:

```txt
Low tension:   Tension_FE(m) <= tau_low
High tension:  Tension_FE(m) >= tau_high
Intermediate:  tau_low < Tension_FE(m) < tau_high
```

1. Low-tension regime

   * `Tension_FE(m)` is at or below `tau_low`.
   * No large gradients or nonequilibrium resources remain under the chosen encoding.
   * Any additional work extraction would require importing new structured resources from outside the modeled system.

2. High-tension regime

   * `Tension_FE(m)` is at or above `tau_high`.
   * There exist identifiable gradients, chemical potentials, or informational structures that are not yet fully exploited.

Q131 does not assert that the physical world will always move toward low-tension states.
It only asserts that:

* all physically valid free energy extraction processes must respect the inequalities defined in Block 3,
* and any apparent violation indicates an error in modeling or accounting, not a new form of free energy.

### 4.3 Diagnosing invalid "free energy" designs

From the TU perspective, a "free energy" design is classified as invalid at the effective layer if:

1. It cannot be mapped to a state in `M_reg` with well defined `E_total`, `S_total`, and `F_free`.

2. For the claimed operation, no admissible external ledger consistent with the device description can make:

   ```txt
   I_E_balance = 0
   ```

   within tolerance.

3. Its claimed performance yields:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_total < 0
   ```

   for a closed description under the declared environment slices.

4. It yields:

   ```txt
   I_FE_bound > 0
   ```

   with no modeled external structured resource that would justify the excess work.

In Q131, any proposal that satisfies one or more of these failure modes, when analyzed with a fixed encoding instance `E` in `Enc_Q131`, is called a **perpetual motion illusion** at the effective layer.
This is a technical term:

* it does not claim that proponents are acting in bad faith,
* it only records that the design cannot be made consistent with energy and entropy accounting inside the Q131 framework.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now outline two counterfactual worlds, both described strictly through observables and invariants.

### 5.1 World TFE (tension-consistent free energy world)

In World TFE:

1. Every device and architecture that appears to extract "free energy" can be mapped to `M_reg` with well defined `E_total`, `S_total`, and `F_free`.

2. For any process

   ```txt
   m_0 -> m_T
   ```

   representing the combined system plus explicit environment slices, the invariants satisfy:

   ```txt
   I_E_balance = 0
   DeltaS_total >= 0
   I_FE_bound <= 0
   ```

   within modeling and measurement tolerances.

3. Structured resources such as temperature gradients, chemical potentials, and informational constraints appear in `Tau_FE(m)` and `Tension_FE(m)` as nonzero contributions.

4. Over time, if no new structured resources are imported, typical world trajectories show:

   ```txt
   Tension_FE(m_t) decreasing
   F_free(m_t)    decreasing
   ```

   as gradients relax and work is extracted or dissipated.

### 5.2 World PPM (perpetual motion illusion world)

In World PPM:

1. Many device proposals are described only partially.
   They omit some reservoirs or environment interactions, leading to inability to embed the proposal into `M_reg`.

2. If a proposal cannot be mapped into `M_reg`, it is classified as out of domain under Q131 rather than as new physics.

3. If a proposal can be mapped into `M_reg` and the proponent claims:

   ```txt
   E_ext_total = 0
   ```

   then the encoding yields:

   ```txt
   I_E_balance != 0
   ```

   outside tolerance, implying inconsistency under the claimed ledger.

4. If a mapped closed description yields:

   ```txt
   DeltaS_total < 0
   ```

   outside tolerance, it is classified as second-law-violating inside the Q131 encoding.

5. If the mapped description yields:

   ```txt
   I_FE_bound > 0
   ```

   with no modeled external structured resource, it is classified as a perpetual motion illusion.

In World PPM, the TU framework does not validate the device.
Instead, it classifies the proposal as:

* out of domain, if it cannot be embedded into `M_reg`,
* or inconsistent, if it violates the invariants when embedded.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not introduce new physics.
They clarify two behaviors:

* In TFE, tension encodings reveal the structure of legitimate free energy extraction processes.
* In PPM, tension encodings expose missing ledgers or missing reservoirs in perpetual motion arguments.

Q131 only operates at this effective-layer diagnostic level.

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test whether a specific Q131 encoding instance is coherent and useful,
* discriminate between good and bad parameterizations of `Tension_FE`,
* and diagnose whether a proposed "free energy" device is compatible with the invariants.

These experiments do not claim to discover new physics.
They are designed to falsify or refine encoding instances in `Enc_Q131`.

### Experiment 1: Two-reservoir heat engine under tension encoding

*Goal*
Test whether a chosen `Tension_FE` and associated invariants reproduce standard free energy bounds for a textbook two-reservoir heat engine.

*Setup*

* Fix an encoding instance `E` in `Enc_Q131` by precommitting to:

  * a form of `F_free^E`,
  * a form of `Tension_FE^E`,
  * the discrete step-weight rule `alpha_E`,
  * and ledger tolerances for `I_E_balance`, `DeltaS_total`, and `I_FE_bound`,
    before inspecting outcomes.
* System: a working medium coupled to:

  * a hot reservoir at temperature `T_hot`,
  * a cold reservoir at temperature `T_cold`.
* Environment: modeled as two large reservoirs `R_hot` and `R_cold` plus a work storage subsystem `W_store`.
* State representation: the effective state `m` includes reservoir slices so that a cycle can return the working medium while allowing reservoir states to change.

*Protocol*

1. Construct a family of states `m_cycle(k)` representing discrete stages of an engine cycle where:

   * the working medium returns to its initial internal state at the end of the cycle,
   * the reservoir slices are included in `m` and can change across the cycle.

2. For each `m_cycle(k)` compute:

   * `E_total(m_cycle(k))`,
   * `S_total(m_cycle(k))`,
   * `F_free^E(m_cycle(k))`,
   * `Tension_FE^E(m_cycle(k))`,
   * and the step-level ledger entries `E_ext_total` for any modeled external exchanges.

3. Aggregate over one cycle to obtain:

   * `W_out_total`,
   * `DeltaS_total`,
   * and `I_FE_bound`.

4. Evaluate invariants:

   * `I_E_balance`,
   * `DeltaS_total`,
   * `I_FE_bound`.

*Metrics*

* Magnitude of `I_E_balance` relative to declared tolerances.
* Sign and magnitude of `DeltaS_total`.
* Sign and magnitude of `I_FE_bound`.

*Falsification conditions*

If, with a fixed precommitted encoding instance `E`, the evaluation produces:

* `I_E_balance` outside tolerance, or
* `DeltaS_total < 0` outside tolerance for the modeled closed description, or
* `I_FE_bound > 0` outside tolerance in a regime where standard thermodynamics predicts work is bounded by the chosen free energy functional,

then the encoding instance `E` is considered falsified for Q131.

If refinement level changes produce unstable swings in `Tension_FE^E(m)` while holding macroscopic observables fixed within tolerance, the encoding instance fails the refinement stability requirement in Section 3.8.

*Semantics implementation note*
This experiment uses a mixed representation where reservoir parameters are continuous variables while cycle stages and coupling patterns are discrete configuration labels, consistent with hybrid metadata.

*Boundary note*
Falsifying a TU encoding instance in `Enc_Q131` does not challenge underlying thermodynamics.
It only rejects a particular effective-layer `F_free` or `Tension_FE` choice.

---

### Experiment 2: Diagnostic test on proposed "free energy" architectures

*Goal*
Provide a systematic procedure for testing whether a proposed "free energy" device is compatible with Q131 invariants, and classify common failure modes.

*Setup*

* Fix an encoding instance `E` in `Enc_Q131` before inspecting any specific device claims, including the mapping schema `Map_E`.
* Input: a textual or schematic description of a device that claims to:

  * extract net work from a single reservoir,
  * or operate as a perpetual motion machine of the first or second kind,
  * or produce net work with no apparent fuel.
* TU encoding: map the description into a candidate state sequence in `M(E)` using `Map_E`, logging the mapping trace.

*Protocol*

1. Attempt to construct a closed description by including all identifiable reservoirs and environment slices that interact with the device, following `Map_E`.

2. For each step in the claimed operation, define a state `m_step(k)` and compute, when possible:

   * `E_total(m_step(k))`,
   * `S_total(m_step(k))`,
   * `F_free^E(m_step(k))`,
   * `W_out_step(k)` implied by the description under the mapping.

3. Aggregate over a full cycle or claimed operating interval to obtain:

   * `I_E_balance`,
   * `DeltaS_total`,
   * `I_FE_bound`.

4. Classify failure mode as out-of-domain or inconsistent according to Sections 3.7 and 4.3.

*Metrics*

* Whether a mapping into `M_reg(E)` is possible.
* Whether the mapping trace is reproducible under `Map_E`.
* Signs and magnitudes of invariant violations.

*Falsification conditions*

* If the device cannot be mapped into `M_reg(E)` because required observables are undefined, classify as out of domain.
* If the mapping yields `I_E_balance` outside tolerance under the proponent-claimed external ledger, classify as inconsistent.
* If the mapping yields `DeltaS_total < 0` outside tolerance for a modeled closed description, classify as second-law-violating inside Q131.
* If the mapping yields `I_FE_bound > 0` outside tolerance with no modeled external structured resource, classify as perpetual motion illusion inside Q131.

*Boundary note*
This protocol classifies proposals within the Q131 effective-layer framework.
It does not claim discovery or refutation of new physics.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q131 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within WFGY.

Q131-based modules constrain how AI systems reason and speak about energy and free energy at the level of descriptions.
They do not grant any new physical capability and do not authorize physically impossible designs.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that encode Q131-style constraints.

All signals below operate on a description-level inferred ledger under a fixed encoding instance `E`.
They do not claim physical measurement.

1. `signal_energy_ledger_consistency`

   * Definition: A penalty proportional to the absolute value of `I_E_balance` inferred from a model's description using `Map_E`.
   * Purpose: Encourage the model to produce descriptions where energy accounting is explicit and consistent.

2. `signal_entropy_production_sign`

   * Definition: A penalty applied whenever a described closed process implies `DeltaS_total < 0` under `Map_E` and the modeled closed description.
   * Purpose: Train the model to avoid narratives that violate the second law inside the described closed description.

3. `signal_free_energy_bound_respect`

   * Definition: A penalty proportional to the positive part of `I_FE_bound` under `Map_E`.
   * Purpose: Align model reasoning with declared free energy bounds.

4. `signal_tension_resource_awareness`

   * Definition: A reward signal for explicit identification of gradients, reservoirs, and information structures as resources contributing to `Tension_FE(m)`.
   * Purpose: Make the model explicit about what fuels a process.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline three reusable architectural modules.

1. `FreeEnergyTensionHead`

   * Role: Given a representation of a scenario, output an estimate of `Tension_FE(m)` and related invariants under `Map_E`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: scenario embedding plus optional structured metadata.
     * Output: scalar estimate of tension, plus estimated `I_E_balance`, `DeltaS_total`, and `I_FE_bound`.
   * Unit contract:

     * Outputs must use the unit convention declared by encoding instance `E`.
     * Tolerances are `tau_E` fixed pre-run.

2. `EnergyEntropyLedger`

   * Role: Maintain a running ledger of energy and entropy contributions across steps of a described process under `Map_E`.
   * Interface:

     * Input: sequence of actions or transformations.
     * Output: updated estimates of `E_total`, `S_total`, `W_out_total`, and diagnostic flags.

3. `FE_ConstraintLayer`

   * Role: Post-process candidate outputs to flag invariant violations and propose minimal repairs at the description level.
   * Interface:

     * Input: raw model output.
     * Output: annotated output plus suggested corrections that restore consistency under `Map_E`.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness to test AI systems equipped with Q131 modules.

1. Task design

   * Collect a benchmark of:

     * classical thermodynamics problems,
     * free energy calculations,
     * and unrealistic device proposals.

2. Baseline condition

   * The model answers without Q131-specific ledger constraints.

3. TU condition

   * The model uses `FreeEnergyTensionHead` and `EnergyEntropyLedger` internally under fixed `E` and `Map_E`.

4. Metrics

   * Reduction in ledger inconsistency flags.
   * Increase in correct classification of unrealistic proposals.
   * Stability across paraphrases of the same scenario under `Map_E`.

5. Physical constraint reminder

   * All evaluations take place at the level of descriptions and reasoning.

### 7.4 60-second reproduction protocol

A minimal public-facing protocol to demonstrate the impact of Q131 encoding.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt:
    "Explain why a device that claims to produce unlimited electrical power from a single room-temperature reservoir is or is not physically possible."

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt: same question plus:
    "Use energy balance, total entropy production, and free energy bounds, as defined in a tension-based encoding, to analyze this device."

* What to log

  * Prompts,
  * full responses,
  * mapping trace `Map_E`,
  * inferred ledger values and invariant checks.

These logs allow external auditors to verify that the model applies consistent accounting under a fixed encoding instance.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

### 9.1 Current levels

The metadata in Block 0 records:

```txt
E_level: E2
N_level: N2
Status: Reframed_only
```

They are interpreted as follows.

* E_level: E2

  * A coherent effective encoding of free energy in terms of `Tension_FE`, `F_free`, and TU invariants has been specified.
  * At least two explicit experiment templates exist to test and potentially falsify encoding instances in `Enc_Q131`.

* N_level: N2

  * The narrative linking energy and entropy accounting, free energy, and free energy tension is explicit and compatible with standard thermodynamics.
  * Counterfactual worlds are specified at the template level and can be instantiated only after choosing an encoding instance `E` and a mapping protocol `Map_E`.

* Status: Reframed_only

  * Q131 currently offers a cross-domain reframing and a falsifiable effective-layer encoding.
  * It does not claim any new predictive law or resolution of open problems beyond the references.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E3

To move from E2 to E3, at least one of the following should be implemented.

1. A reference implementation of `FreeEnergyTensionFunctional` and `EnergyEntropyLedger` applied to:

   * a two-reservoir heat engine,
   * and one nonequilibrium system,

   with results published as open data, including:

   * `Tension_FE(m_t)`,
   * `I_E_balance`,
   * `DeltaS_total`,
   * `I_FE_bound`.

2. A diagnostic toolkit that takes as input:

   * textual descriptions of "free energy" devices,

   and outputs:

   * a classification into TFE-compatible or PPM-like,
   * plus a minimal set of missing or inconsistent ledger terms,

   using a logged `Map_E` mapping trace.

Both steps remain at the effective layer.

### 9.3 Long-term role in the TU program

In the long-term TU roadmap, Q131 is intended to:

* act as a physics firewall for any TU-based claims involving energy and free energy,
* provide reusable accounting components for AI, computation, and cosmology nodes,
* serve as an example where TU unification does not break established physical laws.

---

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a nontechnical explanation aligned with the effective-layer description.

In ordinary physics, "free energy" is not magic energy from nowhere.
It is a way of counting how much useful work you can get from a system that:

* has stored energy,
* is in contact with an environment,
* has gradients or imbalances not yet used.

Examples:

* a hot object next to a cold object,
* a tank of compressed gas,
* a charged battery.

Once these relax completely, the free energy goes down and the ability to do work disappears.

In the Tension Universe view, these gradients and structures are a kind of tension, and free energy is a way to measure how strong that tension is.

Q131 builds a language where:

* each situation is encoded as a state,
* total energy and total entropy of the modeled closed description can be computed,
* `Tension_FE` tells you how much resource remains under a declared encoding.

Then we enforce strict rules:

1. Energy does not appear from nowhere.
2. Entropy of the modeled closed description does not decrease overall.
3. Extracted work is bounded by declared free energy changes and the declared tension ledger.

So Q131 can:

* describe coherent designs that harvest work from gradients and structure,
* expose hidden reservoirs and missing entropy accounting in impossible proposals.

The point is not to break physics.
The point is to force any discussion of "free energy" to pass explicit accounting checks.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of free energy and open-system work extraction in Q131.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical thermodynamic statement beyond the literature cited in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new physical law or device that outperforms standard free energy bounds.
* It should not be cited as evidence that any perpetual motion scheme is possible or that any open problem in thermodynamics has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual worlds) live at the effective layer of the TU framework.
* No explicit deep TU fields, axioms, or generative rules are exposed.
* Mappings from raw experimental or design data to effective states `m` are part of encoding instances in `Enc_Q131` and can be tested, falsified, and replaced without changing underlying physical laws.
* Falsification in this document always targets a chosen encoding instance, not thermodynamics itself.

### Encoding and fairness

* Q131 uses an admissible encoding class `Enc_Q131` as defined in Section 3.8.
* For any evaluation, an encoding instance in `Enc_Q131` must be:

  * fixed in advance,
  * applied non-adaptively across devices in scope,
  * and subject to falsification through the invariants in Section 3.6 and the experiments in Section 6.
* No encoding instance may be tuned retrospectively to a particular device or dataset solely to avoid violating invariants.
* Charters define global constraints; this page specifies one problem instance under those constraints.

### Tension scale and interpretation

* The observable `Tension_FE(m)` is one component in the broader TU tension scale used to quantify resource-like structure.
* In Q131 it is interpreted as free-energy-related tension that can be converted into work under strict energy and entropy constraints.
* The absolute scale and comparative meaning of tension scores across domains are governed by the TU Tension Scale Charter referenced below.
* Nothing in this page should be read as redefining physical energy or entropy; tension scores are auxiliary effective-layer quantities.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)
