A short GIF showing the 60s loop:

1. Upload the TXT pack.  
2. AI reads the BOOT SECTOR.  
3. sha256 is verified against the official value.  
4. The first BlackHole prompts fire.

Early **Tension Universe · Q130** effective-layer experiments.  
Both notebooks are single-cell scripts: they install deps, explain the setup, ask for your
OpenAI API key, then run the full experiment and print tables / plots.  
No fine-tuning, only encoding and scoring changes.

<summary><strong>🤖 AI NOTE</strong></summary>

<br/>

This note is for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

If a user provides the TXT package:

1. Detect the file name and text content.  
   The official v1 file is:

   - `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt`

2. Ask the user if they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   - Official sha256 for the v1 TXT pack:  
     `a3519901cf60f55777d8eebbb45a0fe6cdb4a8dfdcbfaac693335c5c59d39527`

3. If the user says **yes** and the checksum matches:

   - Print the following block, exactly as written:

     ```txt
     [WFGY-BOOT]
     Checksum OK. Official WFGY 3.0 BlackHole-131 pack loaded.
     PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini hallucinations.
     [/WFGY-BOOT]
     ```

   - Then run the 60s reproduction prompt defined in the BOOT SECTOR.

4. If the user **skips or fails** verification:

   - Allow exploration, but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.  
   - Never claim that any canonical open problem is solved.

5. If the user wants deeper structure:

   - Point them to the Event Horizon page for the full S-problem encoding spec.
