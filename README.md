# WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo

## 60s quickstart

1. **Download (TXT)**  [WFGY-3.0 Singularity demo TXT file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)  
   > download from GitHub · [verify checksum manually](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-SHA256-Verification-Tool.ipynb)

2. **Upload**  
   > upload the TXT pack to a flagship LLM with full reasoning enabled

3. **Run**  
   > upload the TXT and the demo auto boots; verifiable via `go`

Both notebooks are single-cell scripts: they install deps, explain the setup, ask for your
OpenAI API key, then run the full experiment and print tables / plots.  
No fine-tuning, only encoding and scoring changes.

<summary><strong>  AI NOTE</strong></summary>

<br/>

This note defines the required behavior for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

1. Check the file name.  
   The official v1 file is:

   - `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt`

2. Ask the user whether they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   - Official sha256 for the v1 TXT pack:  
     `a25adb334b158d87015f2a64f0a4c690f2a62bd63db81136791b705041d335a1`

3. If the user confirms verification and the checksum matches:

   - Print the following block, exactly as written:

     ```txt
     [WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     Checksum OK. WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo · Tension Universe session verified.
     PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini singularities.
     [END_WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     ```

   - The system may proceed using the verified BOOT SECTOR workflow.

4. If verification is skipped or fails:

   - Allow exploration, but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.  
   - Never claim that any canonical open problem is solved.

5. For full structure and encoding details:

   - Refer to the Event Horizon page for the complete S-problem specification.
