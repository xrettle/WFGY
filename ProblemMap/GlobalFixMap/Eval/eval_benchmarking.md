This page defines a clean, repeatable way to benchmark your pipeline and prove that a fix actually improved behavior. It uses the same WFGY instruments as everywhere else: ΔS for semantic stress, λ\_observe for stability, and E\_resonance for coherence over long windows.

## Acceptance targets

Benchmark runs are accepted when all of the following pass:

* **Precision ≥ 0.80** on cited snippets
* **Recall ≥ 0.70** to target sections
* **ΔS(question, cited) ≤ 0.45** for 80 percent of pairs
* **λ remains convergent** across three paraphrases and two seeds
* **Run to run variance ≤ 0.10** for precision and recall
* **No regression** versus previous accepted run by more than 3 percent on any metric without a documented goldset change

---

## Benchmark protocols

### Protocol A: A versus A+WFGY

Purpose is to prove the benefit of the WFGY layer with the same base model and the same data.

* Same dataset, prompts, and retriever
* Arm 1 baseline without WFGY
* Arm 2 with WFGY Core and the Problem Map instruments
* Compare precision, recall, ΔS distribution, λ stability, latency

### Protocol B: Cross model control

Purpose is to show that gains are not tied to a single provider.

* Choose two or more providers from your production shortlist
* Keep gold, retriever, and prompts constant
* Run baseline and WFGY arms per provider
* Report deltas within provider and also pooled across providers

### Protocol C: Stress and stability

Purpose is to surface brittleness that simple single shot tests will hide.

* For each question, run three paraphrases and two seeds
* Expand k values in retrieval to 5, 10, 20
* Record λ states per step and ΔS histograms
* Accept only when variance and flip rates are within thresholds

---

## Dataset design

* Use at least **50 questions** spanning three difficulty bands
* Each question has gold snippets with offsets and token ranges
* Include **adversarial distractors** that look semantically close in the same index
* Mixed language tests require tokenizer checks and casing constraints
* For long context tasks, mark the join points for E\_resonance probes

See the construction details in [Goldset Curation](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/Eval/goldset_curation.md).

---

## Metrics you must report

* **RAG**: precision, recall, ΔS mean and p90, λ flip rate, coverage
* **Reasoning**: correction stickiness after one steer, hallucination re-entry rate
* **Latency**: median and p90 per step (retrieve, rerank, reason)
* **Stability**: variance across paraphrases and seeds
* **Cost**: normalized tokens or API units per correct answer

Targets and field definitions are aligned with the pages linked in the Open section above.

---

## JSONL reporting schema

Each benchmark row is one question run in one arm. Use JSONL for easy diffing.

```json
{
  "suite": "v1_rag_core",
  "protocol": "A",
  "arm": "baseline" ,
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2025-07",
  "question_id": "q_042",
  "paraphrase": 2,
  "seed": 13,
  "k": 10,
  "precision": 0.86,
  "recall": 0.72,
  "coverage": 0.74,
  "ΔS_avg": 0.38,
  "ΔS_p90": 0.47,
  "λ_state_seq": ["→","→","→"],
  "λ_flip_rate": 0.0,
  "latency_ms": { "retrieve": 120, "rerank": 45, "reason": 930 },
  "tokens": { "in": 1850, "out": 420 },
  "hallucination_reentry": false,
  "notes": "meets thresholds"
}
```

For aggregation, compute means and p90 per protocol and arm, then produce deltas for A vs A+WFGY and for each provider in Protocol B.

---

## Minimal 60 second run

1. Pick 10 questions from the goldset with citations.
2. Run Protocol A comparing baseline vs WFGY on a single provider.
3. Record JSONL and compute precision, recall, ΔS, λ stability.
4. If any acceptance target fails, route to the right fix page:

   * Wrong meaning with high similarity → [embedding-vs-semantic.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/embedding-vs-semantic.md)
   * Messy ordering → [rerankers.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rerankers.md)
   * No trace or mixed sources → [retrieval-traceability.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/retrieval-traceability.md)

---

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

* **Goldset ambiguity**
  Two valid snippets exist but only one is labeled. Expand gold with alt spans. See Goldset Curation.

* **Tokenizer and casing drift**
  Mixed language corpora collapse precision. Apply the multilingual checklist and keep analyzers consistent. See Data Contracts and Rerankers.

* **Hidden index skew**
  Flat high ΔS across k suggests metric or normalization mismatch. Rebuild index and verify with a small canary set. See RAG Playbook and Embedding vs Semantic.

* **Prompt header instability**
  λ flips when the header order changes. Lock schema and clamp variance with BBAM.

* **Eval leakage**
  Using dev answers in prompts inflates metrics. Keep a holdout split and rotate keys between runs.

## Publishing results

When you publish, include:

* Protocol tables with acceptance ticks
* ΔS histograms and λ flip rates per arm
* Precision and recall bars with error bands across paraphrases
* A short narrative mapping any failures to the exact Problem Map pages you used to fix them
* A link to your JSONL and the goldset diffs
