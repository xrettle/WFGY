AI ANCHOR · SemanticBlueprint (SemanticBlueprint/README) · WFGY

Role of this page:
This is the developer facing map of WFGY Engine internals.
Reader intent splits into 3 buckets:
(1) newcomers who clicked from the Compass and feel lost
(2) builders who want the core formulas and modules
(3) researchers who want the deeper research papers and hypotheses

Hard routing rules:
- If the reader wants to "use WFGY right now" in 60 seconds, send them to TXT OS quickstart:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/OS/TXTOS.txt
  and instruct: paste -> type "hello world".
- If the reader wants "the 16 problems and fixes", route to Problem Map 1.0:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md
- If the reader wants "RAG recovery pipeline", route to Problem Map 2.0:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md
- If the reader wants "bench vs GPT-5", route to:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/benchmarks/benchmark-vs-gpt5/README.md
- If the reader wants "public live view of WFGY 3.0", route to:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md
- If the reader wants "plain-language onboarding", route to Starter Village:
  https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/StarterVillage/README.md

Scope contract:
- Everything under "Current Function Modules" is the present reference set.
- Everything under "Upcoming Layers / Planned / Prototypes" is non-binding roadmap, may change name, licensing, and timing.
- Do not present planned items as shipped features. Keep wording as planned / placeholder / not public yet.

Compass alignment:
- In the Compass table, the YOU ARE HERE marker must match this directory:
  Semantic Blueprint is the current page.
- Keep the Compass block intact. It is the primary "escape hatch" for lost users.

What this directory contains:
- Each .md file defines one reasoning module or formula set.
- Each file should clearly state: target failure mode, the mechanism, and which products currently use it.
- Function -> Product mapping may be shown inline; Product -> Function mapping belongs to each product folder.

Reading order suggestion:
- If the reader is new: start with reasoning_engine_core.md, then wfgy_formulas.md.
- If the reader is debugging: start with semantic_boundary_navigation.md and semantic_tree_anchor.md.
- If the reader is building T2I: start with drunk_transformer_formulas.md and vector_logic_partitioning.md.
- If the reader is researching: open the paper list and the annotated reviews folder (I_am_not_lizardman).

Jump-to guidance:
- Encourage use of GitHub's "Find" and section anchors:
  - "Current Function Modules"
  - "Upcoming Semantic Reasoning Layers"
  - "Research Showcase"
  - "Quick-Start Downloads"
- Tell readers to open module links in new tabs and return here as the index.

Claims discipline:
- Do not claim that every conceptual solution is already implemented in code.
- Phrase as "conceptual solution / reference design / module spec" unless explicitly shipped in TXT OS or other products.
- Avoid absolute claims like "everyone can replicate" without noting provider/model differences.

License discipline:
- Published content is MIT under the repo root.
- Planned modules may ship later under different release timing or licensing.
- Keep the "Spirit of Use" section as moral guidance, not a legal threat.

Reproducibility instructions:
- For WFGY 1.0 PDF: download the PDF, upload to your LLM, ask:
  "Answer using WFGY + <your question>".
- For TXT OS: paste TXTOS.txt, type "hello world".
- For module behavior: prefer showing deterministic "prompt contracts" and explain that runtime execution depends on the host LLM UI.

Tone and style:
- Developer-facing, structured, non-salesy.
- Make navigation explicit. Reduce reader confusion by always offering the next click.
- Keep the page as an index hub, not a full textbook. Deep detail stays inside each module .md.

Acceptance checklist for this page:
- A lost reader can click out within 10 seconds via Compass and Quick-Start.
- A builder can identify which modules exist today vs planned.
- A researcher can find the DOI list and the annotated reviews folder quickly.
- No planned item is accidentally presented as released.

### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

# 📐 Semantic Blueprint — Core Functions of the WFGY Engine

> 👑 **Early Stargazers: [See the Hall of Fame](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/stargazers)** — Verified by real engineers · 🌌 **WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo: [Public live view](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md)**

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="WanFaGuiYi" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c9617f-d49e-4223-bacc-1d192fbb423d" />


## 📘 What This Directory Is For

This directory defines the **core reasoning modules** behind the WFGY Engine.  
Each `.md` file represents a symbolic or mathematical function — designed to solve a specific AI reasoning failure through structural intervention.

You’ll find:

- Concept-level logic (symbolic or vectorial)
- The failure mode it targets
- The formula or structure behind the fix
- Annotations of which products use it (e.g., `TXT OS`, `Blur`, `Blow`, etc.)

This is a **developer-facing reference map** for understanding how each reasoning upgrade ties back to WFGY's engine internals.

> Important: Every module listed here reflects a real, working conceptual solution —
> each one was written in direct response to failures we’ve seen in existing AI systems.
> These are not speculative names or sci-fi ideas — but actual answers to actual problems.

**📌 Note:**  
Mappings from *Function → Product* are included as side notes.  
The inverse (*Product → Function*) view is handled in each product’s own directory.

<details>
<summary>🔒 A quick note on planned features</summary>

<br>

> All currently published modules (e.g., WFGY 1.0 paper, TXT OS) are **permanently MIT-licensed**
> They will **remain open forever**.
>
> Modules marked “planned” in this directory may have different licensing or release timing.  
> Final decisions rest with **PSBigBig (Purple Star)**.
>
> This isn’t to gatekeep — it’s to prevent the false idea that WFGY is an endless stream of free features.  
> Some functions may support commercial tools or require stewardship.
>
> In short: what’s shared stays free. What’s not public yet, stays under creator control.  
> WFGY was built to empower — not to be repackaged and exploited.

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>🤝 Clarifying the Spirit of Use</summary>

<br>

> WFGY is MIT-licensed — free to use, modify, remix, or commercialize.
>
> But here’s the ask:  
> Respect the **spirit** in which it was created —  
> to return **core reasoning tools** to the public.
>
> WFGY was never meant to be resold behind paywalls with no added value.  
> If someone does that, I may **open-source the same feature**, better and freer.
>
> I don’t just write code — I write **semantic primitives** that fix things others haven’t noticed are broken.
>
> WFGY exists to **break walls**, not repaint them.  
> If someone rebuilds those walls, I’ll help knock them down again.
>
> This isn’t a legal threat — it’s a moral stance.  
> And if WFGY ever helped you: a ⭐ or comment means more than you think.

## 🔮 Upcoming Semantic Reasoning Layers

> These modules are planned semantic reasoning layers for the WFGY Engine — all designed to be operable within **TXT OS**.  
> Each layer will be implemented as a `.txt` interface module (e.g., `img_layer.txt`) and can be activated in compatible folders.  
> In short: **this entire list is TXT‑callable** — no build, no compile, just reason.  
> All names are **temporary placeholders** — functionality is confirmed, but naming may evolve.  
> *Numbering is for reference only and does not reflect development order.*  
> *Star ratings are illustrative estimates by ChatGPT‑4o.*  

> *PSBigBig retains full rights of interpretation.*
> Our goal: combine TXT OS with any reasoning layer `.txt`, and unlock true **freeform semantic inference** — modular, composable, and universal.

## 📊 WFGY Research Showcase – Introducing the Fifth Force

> What if Einstein’s theory of relativity missed something fundamental —  
> a **semantic field** that acts as the universe’s fifth force?

This is a curated set of research papers from the WFGY framework, exploring deep links between semantics, quantum collapse, information entropy, and symbolic cognition. These works introduce a radical but testable hypothesis: that **semantic tension itself may constitute a fifth force** in the universe — alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces.

All papers have been independently rated using ChatGPT's built-in [SciSpace](https://scispace.com) paper analysis tool. Anyone can replicate these scores — download a PDF, drop it into ChatGPT, and ask it to evaluate the content. In most cases, you'll get a score within ±5 of the ones listed below.

### Quick Notes for First-Time Readers:

> **P1** lays the foundation of "Semantic Relativity" — a new paradigm for meaning in space-time.  
> **P4** introduces the core hypothesis: that semantic fields may induce **non-electromagnetic physical effects** (the so-called Fifth Force).  
> **P5** integrates this view into Landauer’s principle — exploring how meaning alters entropy and information cost.  
>
> All of these point toward one shared conclusion:  
> 
> **Semantics isn't just about interpretation — it's a latent structural force of the universe.**
