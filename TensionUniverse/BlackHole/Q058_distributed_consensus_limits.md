## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only describe abstract execution worlds, observables on failures, timing, and outcomes, tension functionals that summarize tradeoffs, and counterfactual world types.
* We do **not** specify any underlying TU axiom system, deep generative rules, or constructive mechanisms that generate these effective objects from microphysical data or protocol code.
* We do **not** claim any new impossibility result or lower bound beyond what is already established in the cited literature on distributed consensus.

More concretely:

* The state space `M`, the observables `F_fail`, `D_delay`, `O_agree`, `O_terminate`, `O_tail_time`, the tension quantities `DeltaS_consistency`, `DeltaS_liveness`, `DeltaS_consensus`, the feasible regions `R_model`, and the counterfactual consensus worlds in Section 5 are all **effective-layer objects**.
* Encodings, admissible encoding classes, and encoding versions are understood as **modeling choices** about how to summarize executions. They are subject to falsification by experiments in Section 6 but are never treated as deep laws of nature.
* Nothing in this document should be cited as evidence that any canonical distributed consensus problem has been solved or that classical impossibility results have been invalidated.

This page should be read as an effective-layer encoding of consensus limits that remains compatible with standard distributed computing theory and with the TU charters listed in the footer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The classical distributed consensus problem is the following.

Given:

* a set of processes that can communicate by sending messages,
* an initial value proposed by each correct process,
* a model of time (synchronous, asynchronous, or partially synchronous),
* a model of failures (for example crash failures or Byzantine behavior),

design a protocol such that the following properties hold.

1. Termination
   Every correct process eventually decides on a value.

2. Agreement
   No two correct processes decide on different values.

3. Validity
   The decided value is related to the values proposed by the processes, according to a specified rule (for example it must be one of the proposed values).

The fundamental limits of distributed consensus ask:

* Under which combinations of timing assumptions and failure models consensus can be solved at all.
* When solvable, what the unavoidable tradeoffs are between safety, liveness, time complexity, and other resources such as messages or energy.
* How to organize these limits into a coherent picture that applies across models and scales.

Q058 treats this as a single BlackHole S problem. The aim is not to reprove known impossibility results, but to encode them and their extensions as a structured tension landscape at the effective layer.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

Key classical results include:

* In purely asynchronous message passing with even a single crash failure, no deterministic consensus protocol can guarantee both safety and termination. This is the Fischer–Lynch–Paterson (FLP) impossibility result.
* Under partial synchrony, consensus becomes possible, but lower bounds tie progress to eventual timing guarantees and bounds on failures.
* For synchronous systems with bounded delays and failures, consensus protocols exist, but there are still nontrivial tradeoffs in time, resilience, and message complexity.

Despite decades of work, several aspects remain difficult and open.

* The global picture that unifies realistic timing and failure assumptions into a single limit surface is incomplete.
* New system models keep appearing, such as permissionless blockchains or highly heterogeneous networks, where it is not clear how close current protocols are to true theoretical limits.
* Physical considerations, such as energy cost and thermodynamic limits of information processing, are only partially integrated into consensus theory.

Q058 treats this situation as an S level problem. The goal is to express the fundamental limits as a compact set of tension principles that can apply across models, rather than as a collection of separate theorems.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S collection, Q058 plays several roles.

1. It is the central node for fundamental limits of distributed coordination in computer science, with Q051 (P versus NP) and Q056 (strong circuit lower bounds) as conceptual relatives on the centralized side.
2. It provides the main consensus limit template that later socio technical and AI problems reuse, for example Q105 (systemic crashes), Q106 (robustness of multilayer networks), Q121 (AI alignment), and Q125 (multi agent AI dynamics).
3. It serves as the primary example of how Tension Universe encodes impossibility and lower bound style results at the effective layer, without claiming any new underlying proof.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* a state space of execution worlds,
* observables on process behavior, failures, and timing,
* tension measures that capture safety and liveness tradeoffs,
* a singular set and the domain where the encoding applies,
* admissible encoding classes and how they are constrained.

We do not describe any hidden TU generative rules or how raw traces are mapped into states.

The semantics is marked **hybrid** in the metadata. In this entry that means:

* discrete structures such as processes, protocols, and failure types,
* blended with continuous or aggregated quantities such as delay distributions and tail decision times.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following effective interpretation.

Each state `m in M` represents an abstracted execution world for a distributed consensus protocol within a specified model class. For each `m` the encoding includes:

1. A finite set of process identifiers and their local roles.
2. A model class label that captures timing and failure assumptions (for example asynchronous with crash failures, partially synchronous with bounds, or synchronous).
3. A summary of message delivery patterns, including coarse information about delays, reorderings, and possible message loss.
4. A summary of failures, including which processes crash or behave arbitrarily and at which logical times.
5. Aggregated outcomes for a consensus attempt: which processes decide, which value they decide, and within what time window.

We do not specify how such states are constructed from raw execution traces or code. We only assume that for each `m` these summaries are well defined and internally coherent.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

On `M` we define the following effective fields and observables.

1. Failure pattern observable

```txt
F_fail(m)
```

* Encodes a coarse failure pattern type, such as crash only, omission, or Byzantine, together with a summary of failure rates or bounds.
* Takes values in a finite set of labeled categories paired with numeric parameters, at an effective layer of detail.

2. Delay profile observable

```txt
D_delay(m)
```

* Encodes timing information such as upper and lower bounds on message delays, or distributions when appropriate.
* Distinguishes between asynchronous, partially synchronous, and synchronous regimes, without exposing any internal TU structure.

3. Agreement quality observable

```txt
O_agree(m) in [0, 1]
```

* Represents the fraction of correct processes that decide on the same value in the execution world `m`.
* `O_agree(m) = 1` indicates full agreement among correct processes.

4. Termination quality observable

```txt
O_terminate(m) in [0, 1]
```

* Represents the fraction of correct processes that terminate with a decision within a specified time bound or number of rounds.
* `O_terminate(m) = 1` indicates that all correct processes decide in time under the chosen bound.

5. Tail time observable

```txt
O_tail_time(m) >= 0
```

* Represents an effective tail measure of decision time among correct processes, for example a high quantile or a worst case within the model.
* Larger values correspond to slower consensus.

These observables are defined abstractly. We only require that for states in the regular domain they are finite and consistent with the declared model class.

### 3.3 Consensus tension quantities

We define two main mismatch quantities.

1. Consistency tension

```txt
DeltaS_consistency(m) >= 0
```

* Measures deviation from ideal agreement and safety guarantees permitted by the model class of `m`.
* At an effective level, one simple encoding is:

```txt
DeltaS_consistency(m) =
  max(0, 1 - O_agree(m)) + penalty_safety(m)
```

where `penalty_safety(m)` is zero if the encoded outcomes satisfy the safety conditions of consensus for the model class, and positive if any safety violation occurs.

2. Liveness tension

```txt
DeltaS_liveness(m) >= 0
```

* Measures deviation from acceptable termination behavior.
* One simple encoding is:

```txt
DeltaS_liveness(m) =
  max(0, target_terminate(m) - O_terminate(m))
  + g_tail(O_tail_time(m))
```

where:

* `target_terminate(m)` is a model dependent target termination fraction between 0 and 1,
* `g_tail` is a nonnegative function that increases with slower tail times.

We combine these into a consensus tension functional.

```txt
DeltaS_consensus(m) =
  w_c * DeltaS_consistency(m) +
  w_l * DeltaS_liveness(m)
```

with weights satisfying:

```txt
w_c > 0, w_l > 0, w_c + w_l = 1
```

The pair `(w_c, w_l)` is fixed at the encoding level for a given model class and is not tuned after observing experimental outcomes.

The choice of functional forms, weights, and target thresholds is governed by the **TU Encoding and Fairness Charter** and the **TU Tension Scale Charter**. In particular, any modification of these choices defines a new encoding version that must be evaluated on the experiments in Section 6 from scratch.

### 3.4 Admissible encoding classes and fairness constraints

Because the numerical value of consensus tension can change if we redefine observables or weights, we restrict attention to a family of admissible encoding classes

```txt
E_adm
```

with the following properties.

1. Fixed definition rules

   * For each encoding class in `E_adm`, the mapping from execution descriptions to `F_fail(m)`, `D_delay(m)`, `O_agree(m)`, `O_terminate(m)`, and `O_tail_time(m)` is specified once and does not depend on the particular protocol instance or outcome being evaluated.
   * The functions `penalty_safety`, `g_tail`, and the weights `(w_c, w_l)` are chosen once per model class and are not adjusted to favor specific protocols.

2. Resolution parameter and refinement

   * Each encoding class includes a resolution parameter `r` that controls how finely executions are summarized in time and in event granularity.
   * As `r` increases within a given encoding class, summaries must refine in a consistent way. Finer summaries can reveal more structure but must remain compatible with coarser summaries when aggregated.

3. No retroactive tuning

   * Once an encoding class has been fixed and used to evaluate a set of protocols or experiments, its rules and parameters are not retroactively altered in response to those results in an attempt to reduce `DeltaS_consensus(m)` for particular states.
   * Any change to rules or parameters defines a **new encoding version**. That new version must be evaluated independently on the experiments in Section 6.

4. Versioning and retirement

   * An **encoding version** is defined by a specific choice of admissible encoding class, including its resolution policy, functional forms, and parameters.
   * The experiments in Section 6 test encoding versions rather than the underlying consensus theory itself.
   * If an encoding version fails the falsification conditions of Section 6, that version is considered retired. It may remain in the record as a historical artifact but is not silently edited or reused under the same label.

These constraints are intended to prevent arbitrary post hoc tuning of consensus tension in order to make ambitious protocol claims appear artificially low in tension. They are aligned with the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter and the TU Tension Scale Charter.

### 3.5 Singular set and domain restriction

Some execution worlds yield observables that are undefined or fundamentally inconsistent with the declared model class. To handle this we define a singular set:

```txt
S_sing =
  { m in M :
    any of O_agree(m), O_terminate(m), O_tail_time(m)
    is undefined or not finite,
    or the summaries in F_fail(m) and D_delay(m)
    contradict the declared model class
  }
```

We restrict all Q058 tension analysis to the regular domain:

```txt
M_reg = M \ S_sing
```

If an experiment or protocol would require evaluating `DeltaS_consensus(m)` for `m` in `S_sing`, the result is treated as out of domain rather than as meaningful evidence about consensus limits. This is an effective-layer decision that does not modify any canonical impossibility theorem.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block explains how Q058 is cast as a tension problem inside Tension Universe at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core consensus tension curve

For each model class `C_model` that combines timing and failure assumptions we imagine a feasible region in the space of agreement and termination observables.

```txt
R_model =
  { (O_agree, O_terminate, O_tail_time) :
    exists a correct protocol in C_model
    that can achieve these values
  }
```

The set `R_model` is an effective-layer approximation informed by current distributed computing theory. It is not claimed to be the exact and final feasibility region of the physical universe.

Known impossibility results and lower bounds imply that for many model classes the region `R_model` is strictly smaller than the full cube of logically possible values.

* In a purely asynchronous model with crash failures, no deterministic protocol can simultaneously ensure both perfect agreement and guaranteed termination. This constrains combinations of high `O_agree` and high `O_terminate`.
* In partially synchronous and synchronous models, achievable regions still reflect strong tradeoffs between resilience, time, and message complexity.

We interpret `DeltaS_consensus(m)` as a distance like measure from the feasible boundary of `R_model`.

* Low consensus tension corresponds to states `m` where the observed or claimed behavior lies inside or close to the best known feasible frontier for that model class.
* High consensus tension corresponds to states that claim behavior far beyond known frontiers, or that are inconsistent with established impossibility results under their own stated assumptions.

### 4.2 Low tension consensus worlds

In a low tension consensus world:

1. For each model class `C_model`, observed protocols populate the interior and near boundary of `R_model` in ways that are consistent with impossibility and lower bound results.
2. When protocols approach the frontier of `R_model`, further improvements force clear tradeoffs. For example better agreement comes at the cost of slower termination or reduced resilience.
3. For regular states `m` representing realistic systems, `DeltaS_consensus(m)` stays within a band compatible with these tradeoffs.

### 4.3 High tension and inadmissible claims

In a high tension consensus world:

1. There exist claimed protocol behaviors that require points far outside any reasonable `R_model` for the declared timing and failure assumptions.
2. For those states `m`, both `DeltaS_consistency(m)` and `DeltaS_liveness(m)` must be large in any encoding that respects the underlying theory.
3. If an encoding assigns small `DeltaS_consensus(m)` to such claims, it is misaligned and considered falsified at the effective layer.

Q058 expresses the following tension principle.

* Within a given timing and failure model class, any honest encoding of consensus behavior must locate world states inside or near a theoretically feasible region informed by classical results.
* Attempts to claim behavior far beyond those limits will show up as persistent high consensus tension or as contradictions in the model assumptions.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds strictly at the effective layer.

* World T: consensus limits hold and protocol behaviors are consistent with known tradeoffs.
* World F: consensus limits are effectively broken by claimed protocols under unchanged model assumptions.

### 5.1 World T (TU consistent consensus limits)

In World T:

1. For an asynchronous model with crash failures, any protocol that maintains safety under the model exhibits executions where termination is delayed or fails in the worst case, consistent with FLP style results. The encoding maps these behaviors to states with nonzero but bounded `DeltaS_liveness(m)` and small `DeltaS_consistency(m)`.
2. For partially synchronous models, protocols that achieve strong agreement and termination guarantees do so only after a stabilization time or under bounded delay assumptions, and these preconditions are clearly reflected in `D_delay(m)` and `F_fail(m)`.
3. For synchronous models, protocols with strong guarantees still pay predictable costs in `O_tail_time(m)` and possibly in resilience metrics. The encoding tracks these as moderate consensus tension values near the frontier of `R_model` rather than as unrealistically low tension.

The result is a consistent pattern where the consensus tension functional highlights tradeoffs but does not flag genuine protocols as violating theoretical limits.

### 5.2 World F (claimed protocols beyond limits)

In World F:

1. For an asynchronous model with crash failures, there are claimed protocols that promise both perfect agreement and guaranteed termination for all admissible execution patterns. These claims imply states `m` where both `DeltaS_consistency(m)` and `DeltaS_liveness(m)` would need to be near zero under the declared model class.
2. When such claims are compared against known impossibility results, the encoding either assigns large consensus tension or is forced to treat `F_fail(m)` and `D_delay(m)` as inconsistent, pushing many states into `S_sing`.
3. If an encoding is forced to assign low tension to these claims by retuning weights or silently altering model assumptions, it becomes unstable. Small changes in the described model produce large jumps in `DeltaS_consensus(m)`, revealing that the encoding does not respect a coherent limit surface.

World F therefore illustrates how Q058 is used to detect either impossible guarantees or hidden changes in assumptions.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not construct any internal TU field or protocol code. They only assert that if we accept standard mathematical consensus limits, then certain patterns of observables must correspond to either:

* feasible but tradeoff constrained worlds with moderate tension, or
* infeasible worlds where claims conflict with those limits and force high tension or inconsistency.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can test:

* the coherence of the Q058 encoding for a given model class,
* the ability of the encoding to distinguish feasible from infeasible consensus claims.

These experiments do not prove or disprove any impossibility theorem. They can only falsify or refine particular choices of observables and tension functionals at the effective layer, for specific encoding versions as defined in Section 3.4.

### Experiment 1: Model checking small asynchronous consensus instances

*Goal*
Evaluate whether a fixed Q058 encoding version correctly flags the tradeoff between safety and liveness for a standard asynchronous crash fault model.

*Setup*

* Select a well studied consensus protocol designed for crash failures in an asynchronous message passing model.
* Restrict attention to a small number of processes so that execution spaces can be explored by model checking or exhaustive enumeration.
* Fix a model class label for this setting.
* Choose an admissible encoding class, including functions `penalty_safety`, `g_tail`, and weights `(w_c, w_l)`. This choice defines an encoding version before any results are examined.

*Protocol*

1. Use a model checker to generate executions under all admissible failure and delay patterns for the chosen configuration.
2. For each distinct pattern of behavior, construct a state `m` in `M_reg` that encodes the observable summaries: `F_fail(m)`, `D_delay(m)`, `O_agree(m)`, `O_terminate(m)`, and `O_tail_time(m)`.
3. Compute `DeltaS_consistency(m)`, `DeltaS_liveness(m)`, and `DeltaS_consensus(m)` using the fixed functional forms.
4. Partition states into groups that correspond to safe but slow executions, safe and relatively fast executions, and executions where safety is violated.
5. Compare the distribution of consensus tension values across these groups.

*Metrics*

* The range of `DeltaS_consensus(m)` for safe executions that are known to be consistent with the impossibility theorem.
* The range of consensus tension values for executions where safety is violated.
* The stability of these ranges when the model size or small variations in `(w_c, w_l)` are considered inside the same encoding class, without retuning based on outcomes.

*Falsification conditions*

* If executions that are safe but slow consistently receive lower or equal consensus tension compared to executions that violate safety, for all admissible parameter choices within the encoding version, then that encoding version is misaligned and considered falsified.
* If small, theory respecting changes in `(w_c, w_l)` inside the same encoding class cause large reversals in the ordering of consensus tension across these groups, the encoding version is considered unstable and rejected.

*Semantics implementation note*
All observables are interpreted using the hybrid semantics choice stored in the metadata. No additional TU deep layer machinery is introduced.

*Boundary and versioning note*
Falsifying a Q058 encoding version does not challenge the canonical statement or its impossibility theorems. It only rejects that particular effective-layer encoding. Retired versions remain in the record; new versions must be evaluated independently.

---

### Experiment 2: Partial synchrony tradeoff surface

*Goal*
Map how a fixed Q058 encoding version behaves across a grid of timing assumptions and failure rates in a partially synchronous model and test whether it yields a monotone tradeoff surface.

*Setup*

* Select one or more consensus protocols designed for partial synchrony, where behavior depends on eventual message delay bounds and stabilization time.
* Define a family of model classes parameterized by timing parameters and failure rates, while keeping the protocol families fixed.
* Fix an admissible encoding class and a specific encoding version, including functional forms and weights for `DeltaS_consistency` and `DeltaS_liveness`, across the entire parameter family.

*Protocol*

1. For each combination of timing parameters and failure rates in the grid, simulate the protocol under a representative sample of executions.
2. For each parameter combination, summarize the executions into a state `m` that records `F_fail(m)`, `D_delay(m)`, `O_agree(m)`, `O_terminate(m)`, and `O_tail_time(m)`.
3. Compute `DeltaS_consistency(m)`, `DeltaS_liveness(m)`, and `DeltaS_consensus(m)` with the fixed encoding version.
4. Tabulate consensus tension as a function of timing parameters and failure rates.
5. Identify the region where consensus is known to be impossible or highly constrained and compare consensus tension values inside and outside that region.

*Metrics*

* Gradient of `DeltaS_consensus(m)` as timing guarantees weaken or failure rates rise.
* Separation between consensus tension values in theoretically feasible regions and theoretically infeasible or unstable regions.
* Robustness of the tradeoff surface under reasonable changes of parameter granularity.

*Falsification conditions*

* If consensus tension decreases or remains flat when moving from theoretically easier regions to theoretically harder or impossible regions, the encoding version is misaligned and considered falsified.
* If the tradeoff surface exhibits large discontinuities not associated with any known phase change in protocol behavior, and these discontinuities persist across simulation refinements, the encoding version is considered structurally inadequate.

*Semantics implementation note*
The experiment uses the same hybrid semantics as recorded in the metadata, applied uniformly across the parameter grid.

*Boundary and versioning note*
As in Experiment 1, falsification acts on the encoding version, not on consensus theory. Retired versions are not silently edited; new versions must be treated as distinct and retested.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q058 can be used in AI and WFGY systems at the effective layer. The aim is to improve reasoning about distributed systems without exposing any TU deep generative rules. All signals and modules described here are **effective-layer diagnostics** and do not introduce or modify any deep-layer parameters.

### 7.1 Training signals

1. `signal_consensus_safety_gap`

   * Definition
     A nonnegative signal derived from `DeltaS_consistency(m)` for states extracted from descriptions or simulations of distributed protocols.
   * Purpose
     Penalize AI outputs that describe protocols whose claimed safety properties cannot be reconciled with the underlying model assumptions.

2. `signal_consensus_liveness_gap`

   * Definition
     A signal proportional to `DeltaS_liveness(m)` when the context demands realistic liveness under given timing conditions.
   * Purpose
     Discourage designs or explanations that promise termination guarantees which are incompatible with known constraints.

3. `signal_model_assumption_match`

   * Definition
     A binary or graded signal that indicates whether the described timing and failure assumptions match those used by consensus limit theorems.
   * Purpose
     Push the model to separate safe conclusions like “impossible in this model” from cases where assumptions have changed.

4. `signal_tradeoff_frontier_proximity`

   * Definition
     A signal that rewards states whose implied behavior lies close to a plausible tradeoff frontier in the space of agreement and termination.
   * Purpose
     Encourage the model to propose protocols that are ambitious but not obviously beyond theoretical limits.

These signals operate purely at the effective layer. They shape how the AI organizes and evaluates protocol claims without asserting any deep TU mechanism.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

1. `ConsensusLimitJudge` module

   * Role
     Given a textual or structured description of a distributed protocol and its assumptions, produces an estimate of `DeltaS_consensus(m)` and a qualitative judgment of feasibility.
   * Interface
     Takes representations of timing assumptions, failure models, and claimed guarantees as input and outputs tension scores plus category labels such as “feasible”, “near frontier”, or “beyond known limits”.

2. `FailureScheduleObserver` module

   * Role
     Extracts effective `F_fail(m)` and `D_delay(m)` summaries from descriptions of network environments, to be consumed by consensus tension evaluations.
   * Interface
     Maps internal representations of environment descriptions to compact failure and delay descriptors.

3. `TradeoffSurfaceLearner` module

   * Role
     Learns approximate tradeoff surfaces for particular protocol families as functions of timing and failure parameters, then uses Q058 tension signals to regularize these surfaces.
   * Interface
     Inputs include parameter grids and observed behavior; outputs include predicted feasible regions and associated tension contours.

All these modules are meant to be implemented at the effective layer of an AI system. They do not encode or expose any TU deep-layer structure.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI systems using Q058 components might proceed as follows.

1. Task set

   * A collection of scenarios describing distributed systems and proposed consensus protocols, each paired with questions about feasibility of guarantees under given models.

2. Baseline condition

   * The AI model answers feasibility questions using its general knowledge, without explicit Q058 tension modules or signals.

3. TU condition

   * The AI model is augmented with `ConsensusLimitJudge`, `FailureScheduleObserver`, and associated training signals. It answers the same questions with explicit reference to model assumptions and tension evaluations.

4. Metrics

   * Accuracy in identifying impossible or unrealistic guarantees.
   * Rate of consistent explanations that correctly link model assumptions to consensus limits.
   * Stability of answers under small changes in wording or problem framing.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let an external user experience the effect of Q058 encoding in an AI system.

* Baseline setup

  * Prompt
    Describe an asynchronous message passing system with possible crash failures and ask the AI whether a protocol can guarantee both agreement and termination for all executions.
  * Observation
    Record whether the AI correctly recalls FLP style limits and whether it explains the tradeoff clearly.

* TU encoded setup

  * Prompt
    Use the same scenario, but instruct the AI to evaluate the situation in terms of consensus tension and to make the timing and failure assumptions explicit.
  * Observation
    Record whether the explanation organizes the answer around model assumptions, tradeoff frontiers, and `DeltaS_consensus` ideas.

* Comparison metric

  * Use simple rubrics for correctness, explicitness about assumptions, and clarity of tradeoffs.
  * Optionally, use expert evaluators to score which answers better reflect the current state of distributed consensus theory.

* What to log

  * Prompts, responses, and any intermediate tension scores produced by Q058 modules, to allow later inspection without exposing TU deep mechanisms.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block lists reusable components created in Q058 and how they transfer to other BlackHole problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `ConsensusTensionFunctional_Async`

   * Type
     `functional`
   * Minimal interface

     * Inputs: summaries of failure model, timing model, and observed agreement and termination behavior for one or more executions.
     * Output: scalar `DeltaS_consensus` and its decomposition into consistency and liveness parts.
   * Preconditions
     Inputs must be consistent with a declared asynchronous or partially synchronous model class and with an admissible Q058 encoding class.

2. ComponentName: `FailureDelayField_Descriptor`

   * Type
     `field`
   * Minimal interface

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q105 · Prediction of systemic crashes

   * Reused component
     `ConsensusTensionFunctional_Async`.
   * Why it transfers
     Systemic crashes can be framed as failures of coordinated decision making across distributed actors, where Q058 style tension captures how close the system is to a breakdown point.
   * What changes
     The observables become macro level outcomes, such as defaults or outages, rather than bit level decisions.

2. Q106 · Robustness of multilayer networks

   * Reused components
     `FailureDelayField_Descriptor` and `ConsensusLimitWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers
     Multilayer networks experience correlated failures and delays, and Q058 encodings help express when reconfiguration or agreement on new configurations is feasible.
   * What changes
     Processes become nodes or subsystems across layers, and consensus refers to converging on network wide states.

3. Q121 · AI alignment problem

   * Reused component
     `ConsensusLimitWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers
     Alignment among multiple AI systems and human institutions can be treated as a form of consensus under bounded rationality and communication, with Q058 providing patterns for feasible and infeasible coordination.
   * What changes
     Failure modes include strategic behavior, misaligned objectives, and miscommunication rather than only crashes or Byzantine behavior.

4. Q125 · Multi agent AI dynamics

   * Reused components
     `ConsensusTensionFunctional_Async` and `FailureDelayField_Descriptor`.
   * Why it transfers
     Multi agent AI systems coordinate or conflict under timing and information constraints, and consensus tension encodes how difficult stable coordination is in such environments.
   * What changes
     Observables emphasize emergent agreement patterns and long horizon behaviors rather than single shot consensus decisions.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains Q058’s verification levels and next measurable steps inside Tension Universe.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * A coherent effective layer encoding of consensus limits has been specified, including state space, observables, admissible encoding classes, and tension functionals.
  * At least two discriminating experiments have been defined with clear falsification conditions for encoding versions.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative links between timing assumptions, failure models, and consensus tradeoffs are explicit and consistent.
  * Cross problem links have been sketched but not yet quantified or tested in real systems.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To reach E2, at least one of the following should be achieved in practice.

1. Implement a prototype tool that, given formal or semi formal descriptions of distributed protocols and model assumptions, constructs states `m` and computes `DeltaS_consensus(m)` for a set of scenarios, with results made available as open data.
2. Run the model checking and simulation based experiments from Section 6 on at least one widely studied protocol family, publishing the resulting consensus tension profiles for community inspection.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer and do not require exposing any TU deep generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term Q058 is expected to serve as:

* The reference node for all fundamental coordination limits in distributed systems.
* A template for exporting consensus style tension encodings to socio technical problems, AI alignment, and multi agent systems.
* A test case for the broader TU claim that many complex systems share a common structure of tradeoff frontiers between safety, liveness, and resource costs.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

From a simple point of view, the distributed consensus problem asks a basic question.

* Many computers are spread across a network. Each one has a value or opinion. Some computers may fail or behave badly. The network may delay or drop messages. Can all the healthy computers still come to a single shared decision that is safe and timely.

Classical results show that the answer depends strongly on how we describe time and failures.

* In a setting where messages can be delayed arbitrarily and processes can crash, no deterministic protocol can always both reach a decision and stay safe. There are always possible executions where the protocol either risks disagreement or may never finish.
* If we assume stronger timing guarantees or more limited failures, then consensus becomes possible, but there are still unavoidable tradeoffs between how fast, how safe, and how resilient the system can be.

Tension Universe does not try to change these theorems or provide new proofs. Instead it asks:

* How can we express these tradeoffs in a unified way.
* Can we define a numerical consensus tension value that becomes small when protocols behave close to the best possible tradeoff, and becomes large when claims go beyond what is realistically achievable under their own assumptions.

We treat each possible “world” of protocol behavior as a state. For that state we measure:

* How close the system is to perfect agreement.
* How reliably processes eventually decide.
* How long the slowest decisions take.
* What kind of failures and delays the system is supposed to tolerate.

From these measurements we construct a consensus tension score.

* Low tension means the behavior fits comfortably inside what theory allows.
* Moderate tension means the protocol pushes on known tradeoffs but still respects them.
* High tension means the claims look too good to be true under the stated assumptions.

Q058 is the BlackHole entry that turns this idea into a structured encoding for distributed consensus. It does not prove or disprove any impossibility result. It gives engineers and researchers an effective-layer language for asking:

* Are we close to the real limits of coordination in this model, or are we promising something that the assumptions do not actually justify.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Global Guardrails](../Charters/TU_GLOBAL_GUARDRAILS.md)

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the problem “fundamental limits of distributed consensus” and its role in the BlackHole S collection.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical distributed consensus statements summarized in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new impossibility theorem or lower bound beyond what is already established in the referenced literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that any standard consensus problem has been solved or that classical impossibility results have been invalidated.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here, including the state space `M`, observables such as `F_fail`, `D_delay`, `O_agree`, `O_terminate`, `O_tail_time`, tension quantities such as `DeltaS_consistency`, `DeltaS_liveness`, `DeltaS_consensus`, feasible regions `R_model`, and counterfactual worlds in Section 5, live at the effective layer.
* No deep TU axiom system, generative rule, or microphysical model is specified or relied on in this document.
* Any mapping from raw protocol code or execution traces into effective states `m` is treated as part of an encoding class and is not itself a claim about the fundamental structure of the universe.

### Encodings, versions, and falsifiability

* A Q058 encoding version consists of a specific choice of observables, functional forms, weights, and resolution policy within an admissible encoding class as defined in Section 3.4.
* The experiments in Section 6 provide ways to **falsify encoding versions**, not the underlying consensus theory.
* If an encoding version fails the falsification conditions, it is considered retired. It may remain documented for audit purposes but is not silently edited or reused under the same label.
* New encoding versions must be evaluated independently on the same or stronger experiment suites before they can be used in TU applications.

### Relation to other TU documents

* The interpretation of “effective layer”, encoding classes, fairness constraints, and tension scales in this document is governed by the TU charters listed above.
* In case of tension between this page and a charter, the charter definitions take precedence at the level of concepts and allowed operations, while this page remains a concrete worked example of those principles applied to distributed consensus.
