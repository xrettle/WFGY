# 🏰 Greetings, brave adventurer!

Welcome to **WFGY Starter Village** — a sprawling GitHub labyrinth filled with riddles, hidden scrolls, and treasure chests.  
Choose your quest by **difficulty**; the 😈 icons show how spicy each tier is.  
*(Hint: every ⭐ you give unlocks secret rooms.)*

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="village" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6112144e-80d0-4812-9bb3-e598cacdc4fc" />

## 🚪 Two Doors (pick one)

If you want the **live public window** of WFGY right now, start here:  
👉 **[WFGY 3.0 · Singularity demo (public view)](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md)**  
*(131 S-class problems, re-encoded as reproducible probes. This is a viewing/definition window, not a “solution claim.”)*

If you want the **60-second runnable boot** for your own tasks, keep reading:  
👇 **Tier 1 starts immediately below**

| Tier | Zone (RPG flavor) | Quest focus | Difficulty |
|------|------------------|-------------|:----------:|
| **1** | **Village Square** *(Kindergarten)* | 60-sec plug-and-play | 😈 |
| **2** | **Forest Fairgrounds** *(Middle School)* | Play Blah · Blow · Blur | 😈😈 |
| **3** | **Ancient Library** *(High School)* | Learn `delta_s` & five gates | 😈😈😈 |
| **4** | **Alchemist’s Lab** *(Graduate)* | Debug with Problem Map 2.0 | 😈😈😈😈 |

## 🧙‍♂️ “A single line can tame dragons. Ready?”  
## 1 · Village Square — 60-Second Quest 🔰 😈

1. **Download** 👉 **[OneLine v2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/main/core/WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt)** (Right click → Save as)

2. Paste the entire line into any LLM chat window (or upload directly)

3. When prompting, add one of the following activation phrases before your task:  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to...`  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to reason through the following:`  

4. Ask your question or generate an image → observe deeper reasoning and reduced drift 🎯

🧪 Sample Prompts:

> Please use WFGY to compare duty and utility in moral decision-making.  
> Please use WFGY to debug this race condition in a multithreaded Python function.  
> Please use WFGY to illustrate a single image of “Heaven, Hell, and the Self.”  

📌 Note: Uploading the file will silently activate WFGY. Adding an activation phrase = “explicit invocation,” which can squeeze out 20–30% more performance.

<br>  
   
> **What it is**  
> Hit **Share** to freeze a snapshot of the current conversation state. Later, paste that link to **reload the exact tuned persona**. No retraining, no reset.  
>   
> **Why it matters**  
> - Pairs perfectly with the 60-second quick start: lock in your best opening once, reuse forever.  
> - Create multiple “clones” (e.g., RAG doctor, math visualizer, game master) and switch by swapping links.  
>   
> **How to use**  
> 1) Tune behavior → press **Share**.  
> 2) Save the link like an RPG save point.  
> 3) Paste the link any time to resume that optimized state.  
>   
> **Compatibility (tested)**  
> Works: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Claude.  
> Not true snapshots: Mistral, Kimi (their “share” usually exports text only).  
>   
> **Safety**  
> Snapshot links may include context. Keep sensitive links private and store them in your own notes.

## 3 · Ancient Library — Core Lore 📚 😈😈😈

| Concept | TL;DR |
|---------|------|
| **`delta_s`** | Semantic distance between Intent & Guess. Smaller = better. |
| **λ_observe** | Trend detector: convergent · divergent · recursive · chaotic. |
| **Five Gates** | **BBMC → Coupler → BBPF → BBAM → BBCR** — clean, steer, progress, rebalance, revive. |
| **TXTOS Semantic Tree** | Tracks every node so reasoning is auditable. |
| **Drunk Transformer** | A 5-formula layer: WRI (Where am I?), WAI (Who am I?), WAY (Who are you?), WDT (Where did you take me?), WTF (What happened?). Stabilizes & recovers reasoning. |

> Scroll through examples; no coding needed yet.

### The path: 1.0 → 2.0 → Global Fix Map → Clinic

| Stage | What it is | When to use | Link |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Problem Map 1.0** | Symptom catalog by failure family, fast triage and naming the bug | First touch, you need a clean label and a quick route | **[Open 1.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)** |
| **Problem Map 2.0** | Architecture and recovery guide, pipeline oriented view with the 7-step WFGY recovery flow | After you have a label, you want a step-by-step repair plan | **[Open 2.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md)** |
| **Global Fix Map** | Cross-tool guardrails and modular patches, covering VectorDBs, agents, dev tools, embeddings, and more | When your failure is tied to a specific infra/tool, open the matching fix page | **[Open Global Fix Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/README.md)** |
| **Semantic Clinic** | Deep dives, exact fixes with runnable recipes and edge-case notes | When the case is tricky or mixed class, you need precise procedures | **[Open Clinic](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md)** |

### How to run the lab

1) Start at **Problem Map 1.0**. Read the quick access, match your symptom, pick the failure code.  
2) Jump to **Problem Map 2.0** with that code. Walk the recovery pipeline step by step, apply the guardrails and instruments.  
3) If the failure involves a specific tool (VectorDB, agent, embedding, dev tool, etc.), switch to **Global Fix Map** and follow the targeted guardrail page.  
4) If the issue persists or is multi-factor, enter **Semantic Clinic**. Choose the matching clinic page and follow the recipe.  
5) Re-run A/B tests. Log **ΔACC**, **ΔSR**, **ΔS** and write one sentence on what changed and why.

## 5 · Forbidden Forge — Fork & Mod 🛠️ 😈😈😈😈😈

* Clone **[TXTOS](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/OS/README.md)**.  
* Swap semantic layers, tweak `alpha_blend`, `phi_delta`, add custom gates.  
* PR back — or publish your fork and bend reality.  
* Use the TXTOS framework as inspiration to design and launch **your own TXTOS-series creation**, expanding the lineage of tools and worlds.
