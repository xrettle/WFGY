## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this Q036 entry are made strictly at the effective layer of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* We only specify:

  * effective state spaces and descriptors,
  * admissible encoding and mechanism library classes,
  * observables, mismatch fields, and spectral_tension functionals,
  * counterfactual worlds and falsification style experiments.

* We do not:

  * propose or prove any microscopic Hamiltonian for high temperature superconductors,
  * introduce new theorems, axioms, or physical laws beyond the cited literature,
  * derive any TU core generative rule, axiom system, or deep field construction,
  * map raw experimental data or ab initio calculations into internal TU fields.

* This page must not be cited as evidence that the microscopic mechanism of high temperature superconductivity has been solved. It only defines an effective layer encoding and spectral_tension scheme that can be used to:

  * test candidate microscopic mechanism libraries,
  * compare encodings,
  * and design discriminating experiments.

* In the TU Tension Scale, the Q036 tension quantities are spectral_tension type objects. They measure mismatch between microscopic spectral and pairing patterns and macroscopic phase diagrams under a fixed mechanism library. They are not mechanical stress tensors and they are not assigned any direct dynamical force interpretation.

The canonical physics problem remains open. This document only defines an E1 level encoding and a family of tests at the effective layer.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

High temperature superconductivity refers to superconducting phases that occur at critical temperatures significantly higher than those explained by conventional BCS theory and electron phonon pairing in simple metals.

The canonical microscopic problem is:

> For cuprates, iron based superconductors, and related strongly correlated materials, identify a coherent microscopic mechanism or a small library of mechanisms that explains:
>
> * why superconductivity appears at the observed critical temperatures,
> * why the pairing symmetry takes the observed forms,
> * how the phase diagrams depend on doping, pressure, and other control parameters,
> * and how normal state anomalies connect to the onset of superconductivity.

This includes questions such as:

* What are the dominant pairing glues or channels in these materials?
* How do strong electronic correlations, Mott physics, and lattice structure cooperate to produce high critical temperatures?
* Is there a unified mechanism class that covers major high Tc families, or are different families governed by genuinely different microscopic mechanisms?

We do not assume any particular mechanism is correct. The question is treated as an open identification and unification problem at the microscopic level.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The microscopic mechanism of high temperature superconductivity remains an open problem. Partial knowledge includes:

* Conventional electron phonon pairing can explain many low Tc superconductors but is generally insufficient to account for the highest critical temperatures in cuprates and several other families.
* Strong correlation effects, proximity to Mott insulating phases, spin fluctuations, multiband effects, and orbital physics all appear important, but their precise roles are debated.
* Several mechanism proposals exist, such as spin fluctuation mediated pairing, resonating valence bond like pictures, various multiband and orbital selective scenarios, and more.
* Phase diagrams of high Tc materials often include pseudogap phases, strange metals, and competing orders. These features are only partially understood and are not captured by a single widely accepted microscopic theory.

There is no consensus on a single microscopic mechanism or a small set of mechanism templates that can robustly and quantitatively explain the observed phenomenology across material families. The problem is considered one of the central open questions in condensed matter physics.

From the TU perspective, Q036 is therefore an open microscopic physics problem whose effective layer encoding has reached verification level E1 in this document. We have a coherent encoding and tension scheme, but no claim that the underlying physics problem is solved.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q036 plays the following roles:

1. It is a flagship example of a spectral_tension problem in strongly correlated quantum matter. The primary tension observable compares microscopic electronic spectra, pairing indicators, and lattice controlled mechanisms with macroscopic superconducting behavior and phase diagrams.

2. It anchors a cluster of questions about quantum phases, quantum thermodynamics, and room temperature superconductivity design.

3. It provides a test case for TU encodings that must reconcile:

   * detailed microscopic spectral data,
   * coarse grained phase diagrams and thermodynamic observables,
   * and a finite library of candidate microscopic mechanisms.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q036 sits inside the BlackHole graph as nodes and edges among Q001–Q125. Each edge includes a one line reason that points to a concrete component or tension type.

  Reason: Shares thermodynamic tension style constraints between microscopic quantum states and macroscopic response.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q036 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059)
  Reason: Reuses “information versus physical cost” tension patterns to measure how much microscopic mechanism detail is required for predictive control of high Tc materials.

* Q091 (BH_EARTH_CLIMATE_SENS_L3_091)
  Reason: Both treat “macroscopic response versus strongly coupled micro degrees of freedom” as a tension problem between model spectra and observed bulk behavior.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state space,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and spectral_tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions,
* admissible encoding and mechanism library classes.

We do not describe any hidden TU generative rules or construction of internal TU fields from raw data.

In this problem, `Semantics: hybrid` means:

* some indices and labels (for example lattice sites, mechanism labels, phase labels) are discrete, and
* spectral and phase diagram information is represented as continuous quantities that have already been projected into finite dimensional descriptors.

No claim is made about any particular microscopic discretization or continuum limit. Only the hybrid descriptor level is used.

### 3.1 State space

We assume the existence of an effective state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation:

* Each state `m` in `M` represents a coherent “high Tc configuration” for:

  * a specific material family or compound class,
  * a range of control parameters such as doping and pressure,
  * a choice of experimental or theoretical probe resolution.

For a given state `m`, we assume the following information is encoded in a coarse yet coherent way:

* electronic spectral summaries near the Fermi level,
* lattice and structural descriptors at the level of symmetry and local environment classes,
* macroscopic phase diagram segments over a bounded range of control parameters.

We do not specify any map from raw experimental data or ab initio simulations into `M`. We only assume that for the materials and regimes of interest there exist states in `M` that encode these summaries consistently at the effective layer.

### 3.2 Admissible encoding and mechanism library classes

We introduce an admissible class of encodings for Q036.

1. Mechanism library class

```txt
L_mech = { M_1, M_2, ..., M_K }
```

where:

* `K` is a finite positive integer chosen in advance,
* each `M_k` is a mechanism template describing a candidate microscopic mechanism type (for example spin fluctuation pairing, RVB like pairing, multiband orbital scenarios) at the effective layer.

Admissibility conditions:

* The library is chosen using only high level meta information such as:

  * which broad mechanism families are seriously considered in the literature,
  * which energy scales appear relevant in aggregate.

* The library cannot be tuned separately for each material state `m`. Once fixed, it must be reused across all `m` in the domain of interest.

* The library does not depend on the detailed spectral summaries or phase diagrams of any specific `m` that will be evaluated. It is fixed before tension evaluation.

2. Encoding class

An encoding in the Q036 context is a pair

```txt
E = (FeatureMap, L_mech)
```

where:

* `FeatureMap` is a procedure at the effective layer that assigns to each state `m` in `M` a finite dimensional summary of:

  * microscopic spectral features,
  * macroscopic phase diagram features,

  in a fixed format suitable for tension evaluation.

* `L_mech` is a mechanism library chosen as above.

The admissible encoding class `E_HTC` consists of all such pairs `E` that satisfy:

* finiteness of `L_mech`,
* uniform reuse of `L_mech` across states,
* bounded feature dimension for all `m` in the domain,
* stability under refinement as described below.

3. Refinement order

We assume a refinement parameter

```txt
k = 1, 2, 3, ...
```

that indexes increasingly refined versions of the feature map, for example:

* finer grids in energy and momentum windows,
* finer sampling in doping, pressure, or temperature,
* richer yet still finite sets of derived observables.

Refinement is monotone in the sense that:

* a higher `k` includes at least as much information as a lower `k` in a compatible way,
* for any fixed `m` in `M`, the sequence of feature representations under `FeatureMap_k` is well defined.

We do not specify how the refinement is implemented in practice. We only require that each `FeatureMap_k` remains within the admissible encoding class `E_HTC` and respects the fairness rules in the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter.

### 3.3 Effective observables and mismatch fields

Within an admissible encoding `E` in `E_HTC`, we define the following effective observables.

1. Spectral descriptor

```txt
rho_spec(m; E_window, k_window)
```

* Input: state `m` and a bounded window in energy and momentum space.
* Output: a nonnegative scalar or small vector summarizing spectral weight and correlation features in that window.

2. Pairing indicator

```txt
O_pair(m; channel)
```

* Input: state `m` and a pairing channel label (for example d like, s like, extended s).
* Output: an effective scalar for the strength and coherence of pairing correlations in that channel.

3. Phase diagram descriptor

```txt
Phi_phase(m; control_window)
```

* Input: state `m` and a bounded range of control parameters (for example a doping range).
* Output: a structured summary of which phases appear in this window and where superconducting regions lie.

4. Pairing mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_pair(m; E)
```

* A nonnegative scalar that measures how much the pairing indicators encoded in `m` deviate from the nearest mechanism template in `L_mech` under encoding `E`.

* Properties:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_pair(m; E) >= 0
  DeltaS_pair(m; E) = 0  only if pairing features match some M_k in L_mech within the encoding tolerance
  ```

5. Phase diagram mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_phase(m; E)
```

* A nonnegative scalar that measures deviation between the phase diagram features encoded in `m` and the predictions of mechanisms in `L_mech` under encoding `E`.

* Properties:

  ```txt
  DeltaS_phase(m; E) >= 0
  DeltaS_phase(m; E) = 0  only if phase diagram features are compatible with at least one template M_k
  ```

6. Combined high Tc mismatch

We define the combined mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_HTC(m; E) = w_pair * DeltaS_pair(m; E)
                 + w_phase * DeltaS_phase(m; E)
```

with weights subject to

```txt
w_pair >= 0
w_phase >= 0
w_pair + w_phase = 1
w_pair, w_phase are fixed for E and do not depend on m
```

The weights are part of the encoding choice but must be chosen once for a given encoding `E` and reused across all states and materials. They cannot be retuned to reduce `DeltaS_HTC` for specific materials after seeing the data.

### 3.4 Effective spectral_tension tensor

Consistent with the TU Tension Scale Charter, we assume an effective spectral_tension tensor of bookkeeping type

```txt
T_ij(m; E) = S_i(m; E) * C_j(m; E) * DeltaS_HTC(m; E) * lambda(m; E) * kappa
```

where:

* `S_i(m; E)` is a source like factor for how strongly component `i` injects microscopic mechanism related claims into the configuration `m`.
* `C_j(m; E)` is a receptivity like factor for how sensitive component `j` is to mechanism mismatch in this configuration.
* `DeltaS_HTC(m; E)` is the combined high Tc mismatch defined above.
* `lambda(m; E)` encodes the local convergence state of reasoning about high Tc mechanisms in this encoding.
* `kappa` is a fixed coupling constant for Q036 encodings.

The index sets for `i` and `j` are left implicit. It is sufficient that for each admissible encoding `E` and state `m` in the regular domain the tensor components are finite.

This `T_ij` is an effective layer tensor that packages spectral_tension contributions for Q036. It is not a mechanical stress tensor, it is not derived from TU core field equations, and it carries no direct dynamical meaning beyond the bookkeeping of mismatch factors.

### 3.5 Invariants, hybrid semantics, and regular domain

For each admissible encoding `E` and refinement level `k`, we define

```txt
Tension_HTC(m; E, k) = DeltaS_HTC_k(m; E)
```

where `DeltaS_HTC_k` is the combined mismatch computed using `FeatureMap_k`.

We then define a family level invariant

```txt
I_family(E, k) = sup over m in M_reg(E, k) of Tension_HTC(m; E, k)
```

where `M_reg(E, k)` is the regular domain at level `k` as defined below. The supremum is taken over the set of states for which the encoding is defined and finite.

We introduce the singular set

```txt
S_sing(E, k) = { m in M : DeltaS_HTC_k(m; E) is undefined or not finite }
M_reg(E, k)  = M \ S_sing(E, k)
```

All tension analysis for Q036 is restricted to `M_reg(E, k)`. States in `S_sing(E, k)` are treated as “out of domain” rather than as evidence for or against any mechanism.

Hybrid semantics is enforced as follows:

* Spectral quantities inside `rho_spec` are continuous in the underlying physics but appear here only through finite descriptors.
* Phase diagram patterns in `Phi_phase` are encoded as discrete labels over continuous control windows.
* Mechanism labels in `L_mech` are purely discrete.

We do not require that `I_family(E, k)` is finite for arbitrary encodings. Instead, admissible encodings in `E_HTC` are required to have

```txt
I_family(E, k) < infinity  for all k
```

within the range of refinement scales considered. In the TU Tension Scale this `I_family(E, k)` is the family level spectral_tension envelope for Q036.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q036 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core high Tc spectral_tension principle

Given an admissible encoding `E` in `E_HTC`, the core high Tc spectral_tension functional is

```txt
Tension_HTC(m; E, k) = DeltaS_HTC_k(m; E)
```

for each state `m` in `M_reg(E, k)` and refinement level `k`.

Low spectral_tension (small `Tension_HTC`) indicates that:

* pairing features and phase diagram features in `m` are both close to predictions from some mechanism template in `L_mech`,
* the same mechanism library remains usable across different material families at this refinement scale.

High spectral_tension indicates that:

* either pairing or phase diagram features are incompatible with any mechanism in `L_mech`,
* or different families demand incompatible mechanism assignments that cannot be reconciled with a fixed finite library.

### 4.2 Unified mechanism as a low tension condition

At the effective layer, the statement “a unified microscopic mechanism or small mechanism library explains high Tc materials” can be phrased as:

> There exists an admissible encoding `E` in `E_HTC` and a refinement level threshold `k_0` such that for all `k >= k_0` the family level spectral_tension invariant satisfies
>
> ```txt
> I_family(E, k) <= epsilon_HTC
> ```
>
> for some small threshold `epsilon_HTC` that does not grow without bound as `k` increases.

Informally, once a sufficiently refined yet finite description of spectra and phase diagrams is used, a fixed mechanism library can keep the spectral_tension between observed features and that library within a narrow band for all relevant high Tc materials.

### 4.3 Fragmented mechanisms as persistent high tension

The statement “no unified microscopic mechanism is adequate” can be phrased as:

> For every admissible encoding `E` in `E_HTC` and every refinement strategy, there exists a sequence of refinement levels `k_n` and states `m_n` in `M_reg(E, k_n)` such that
>
> ```txt
> Tension_HTC(m_n; E, k_n) >= delta_HTC
> ```
>
> for some strictly positive `delta_HTC` that does not shrink to zero as `n` increases.

In this case, any attempt to use a fixed finite mechanism library and a stable encoding will face persistent high spectral_tension somewhere in the high Tc material space.

### 4.4 Fairness constraints and non cheating condition

The admissible encoding class already includes fairness constraints, but for Q036 we restate the non cheating condition explicitly:

* The mechanism library `L_mech` and weights `w_pair`, `w_phase` are fixed before evaluating any particular material state at the given level.

* They cannot be tuned post hoc per sample in order to reduce `DeltaS_HTC`.

* Refinement `k` may increase the resolution of features but cannot introduce new mechanism templates that are tailored to specific anomalies.

These constraints ensure that low or high spectral_tension conclusions are genuinely about the compatibility between a fixed mechanism library and a broad class of materials, not about retrospective tuning.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe two counterfactual worlds for Q036, purely at the effective layer.

* World T: There is a coherent microscopic mechanism library that keeps high Tc spectral_tension low across known materials.
* World F: No finite mechanism library in the admissible class can keep spectral_tension low. The microscopic story remains fragmented.

### 5.1 World T (unified mechanism, low spectral_tension)

In World T:

1. Mechanism library sufficiency

   * There exists an admissible encoding `E_T` and threshold `k_0` such that for all `k >= k_0`:

     * for each high Tc family considered, there is at least one `M_k` in `L_mech` that fits both pairing and phase diagram features with small mismatch,

     * `Tension_HTC(m; E_T, k)` remains below `epsilon_HTC` for all representative states `m` across the material families.

2. Robust pairing patterns

   * Encoded pairing indicators `O_pair(m; channel)` for high Tc materials cluster around a small set of channels predicted by the library.
   * Deviations can be treated as controlled perturbations rather than fundamental contradictions.

3. Phase diagram coherence

   * Encoded phase diagrams `Phi_phase(m; control_window)` match predictions from the same mechanism templates that explain pairing features.
   * Qualitative shapes such as domes, pseudogap regions, and strange metal regimes follow patterns that are predictable from the mechanism library.

4. Stability under refinement

   * As the refinement parameter `k` increases, spectral_tension values remain within a stable low band instead of revealing new high tension anomalies.
   * The invariant `I_family(E_T, k)` does not grow beyond `epsilon_HTC` for larger `k`.

### 5.2 World F (fragmented mechanism, persistent high spectral_tension)

In World F:

1. Mechanism library insufficiency

   * For any admissible encoding `E` and any finite mechanism library `L_mech`, there exist high Tc families for which:

     * no mechanism template in `L_mech` can simultaneously fit pairing and phase diagram features,

     * `DeltaS_HTC(m; E)` remains above `delta_HTC` for representative states of those families.

2. Incompatible pairing stories

   * Some materials require strong d like pairing features, others require mechanisms that are incompatible with those features.
   * Attempts to include both in `L_mech` lead to conflicts when a single parameterization is applied across families.

3. Phase diagram contradictions

   * Phase diagrams in different families display critical behavior and competing orders that cannot be reconciled with a unified mechanism library.
   * Capturing one family with low spectral_tension requires changes that increase spectral_tension elsewhere.

4. Refinement reveals new anomalies

   * As the refinement parameter `k` increases, previously hidden mismatch features appear.
   * There exists a sequence of refinement levels where `I_family(E, k)` is bounded below by `delta_HTC` independently of how `L_mech` is chosen, as long as it is finite and admissible.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

These worlds do not assert anything about the actual microscopic Hamiltonians or their exact derivation from quantum field theories. They only describe possible patterns of observables and spectral_tension scores at the effective layer of the TU encoding.

They can be used to:

* falsify or support specific mechanism libraries and encodings,

* organize data analysis and model comparison,

* and define what it would mean, at the effective layer, for the high Tc mechanism story to look unified or fragmented.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of the Q036 encoding,
* discriminate between different encodings in `E_HTC`,
* provide evidence about whether a given mechanism library behaves more like World T or World F.

These experiments do not solve the microscopic mechanism problem. They can only falsify or support specific TU encodings for Q036.

Since Q036 is currently at E_level E1, the experiments described here should be understood as E1 level discriminating tests. They guide how one might stress test candidate encodings on real or simulated data. They do not yet constitute a full E2 or E3 verification pipeline.

### Experiment 1: Cross family mechanism library test

*Goal:*
Test whether a fixed finite mechanism library and encoding can keep high Tc spectral_tension within an acceptable band across major material families.

*Setup:*

* Select several high Tc material families (for example cuprates, iron based superconductors, one or two additional families).

* For each family, gather:

  * representative electronic spectral summaries from experiments or theory,
  * representative phase diagram segments, including superconducting regions and adjacent phases.

* Choose an admissible encoding `E = (FeatureMap, L_mech)` and a refinement strategy `k`.

* Fix the mechanism library `L_mech` and weights `w_pair`, `w_phase` before spectral_tension evaluations.

*Protocol:*

1. For each material family and refinement level `k`, construct a representative state `m_family,k` in `M_reg(E, k)` encoding

   * spectral descriptors `rho_spec`,
   * pairing indicators `O_pair`,
   * phase diagram descriptors `Phi_phase`.

2. Evaluate `DeltaS_pair_k(m_family,k; E)` and `DeltaS_phase_k(m_family,k; E)` using the fixed mechanism library.

3. Compute `Tension_HTC(m_family,k; E, k)` for each family at each level.

4. Record the distribution of spectral_tension values across families and refinement levels.

*Metrics:*

* Per family average and maximum of `Tension_HTC(m_family,k; E, k)`.

* Family level empirical invariant estimate

  ```txt
  I_family_emp(E, k) = max over families of Tension_HTC(m_family,k; E, k)
  ```

* Stability of `I_family_emp(E, k)` as `k` increases within the chosen refinement scheme.

*Falsification conditions:*

* If for all reasonable admissible choices of `E` with a fixed finite `L_mech`, the empirical invariant `I_family_emp(E, k)` exceeds a pre agreed threshold `epsilon_HTC` at some refinement level and cannot be reduced without changing `L_mech`, then the corresponding encoding is considered falsified as a candidate World T encoding.

* If small and justifiable changes in encoding details produce qualitatively different spectral_tension profiles, while large spectral_tension appears unavoidable for some families, the encoding is considered unstable.

*Semantics implementation note:*
All quantities are represented using the hybrid semantics declared in the metadata. Lattice aspects appear as discrete indices, while spectra and phase diagrams are treated through continuous summaries that have been projected into finite descriptors.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical microscopic problem. The experiment can rule out specific mechanism libraries and encodings as coherent low spectral_tension explanations, but it cannot by itself prove which microscopic mechanism is true.

---

### Experiment 2: Non equilibrium pairing dynamics test

*Goal:*
Assess whether a given mechanism library and encoding capture key qualitative features of non equilibrium pairing dynamics in high Tc materials.

*Setup:*

* Select one or more high Tc materials with available pump probe or ultrafast spectroscopy data near the superconducting transition.

* For each material, identify:

  * key temporal response features (for example relaxation times, amplitude modes, phase oscillations),
  * conditions under which superconducting order is suppressed and reformed.

* Choose a mechanism library `L_mech` with explicit qualitative predictions about such non equilibrium responses.

*Protocol:*

1. Construct states `m_dyn` in `M_reg(E, k)` that encode

   * spectral features before and after pumping,
   * coarse grained time dependent observables.

2. For each mechanism template `M_k` in `L_mech`, derive expected response patterns at the effective layer and encode them as a reference feature set.

3. Compute a dynamical mismatch

   ```txt
   DeltaS_dyn(m_dyn; E)
   ```

   that measures deviation between observed and predicted patterns.

4. Combine `DeltaS_dyn` with static `DeltaS_pair` and `DeltaS_phase` to form an extended spectral_tension

   ```txt
   DeltaS_HTC_ext(m_dyn; E) =
       u_pair  * DeltaS_pair(m_dyn; E)
     + u_phase * DeltaS_phase(m_dyn; E)
     + u_dyn   * DeltaS_dyn(m_dyn; E)
   ```

   with fixed weights `u_pair`, `u_phase`, `u_dyn` that sum to 1.

*Metrics:*

* Per material values of `DeltaS_dyn(m_dyn; E)` and `DeltaS_HTC_ext(m_dyn; E)`.

* Comparison of extended spectral_tension values across materials and mechanisms.

*Falsification conditions:*

* For a given mechanism template `M_k` and encoding `E`, if the extended spectral_tension `DeltaS_HTC_ext` consistently exceeds a threshold across multiple materials, while other templates or encodings achieve significantly lower spectral_tension, then `M_k` is considered falsified as a universal mechanism.

* If no combination of mechanisms from a fixed finite `L_mech` can keep `DeltaS_HTC_ext` below a plausible band even after modest encoding adjustments, then the pair `(E, L_mech)` is rejected as a World T encoding.

*Semantics implementation note:*
The time dependent data are encoded in hybrid fashion. Discrete time samples are mapped to continuous summary statistics, and continuous spectral features are discretized into finite windows suitable for the encoding.

*Boundary note:*
Falsifying a TU encoding in this experiment is not the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment tests whether the current mechanism library and encoding can handle both static and dynamic features consistently at the effective layer.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q036 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework at the effective layer, without revealing any deep TU generative rules.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that use Q036 spectral_tension quantities as auxiliary objectives.

1. `signal_mechanism_tension_HTC`

   * Definition: a scalar proportional to `DeltaS_HTC(m; E)` computed from internal representations of a high Tc context.

   * Purpose: penalize internal states that encode mutually incompatible microscopic mechanism stories for the same material family.

2. `signal_phase_diagram_coherence_HTC`

   * Definition: a scalar measuring mismatch between model generated or interpreted phase diagrams and mechanism compatible phase diagrams under the chosen encoding.

   * Purpose: encourage coherent linking between microscopic explanations and macroscopic phase diagrams.

3. `signal_counterfactual_separation_HTC`

   * Definition: a signal that measures how distinctly the model separates World T and World F style assumptions when asked to reason under each scenario.

   * Purpose: reward clear separation of assumptions instead of blending incompatible mechanism narratives.

4. `signal_library_reuse_efficiency`

   * Definition: a signal that rewards solutions where a small fixed mechanism library suffices to explain multiple material families with low spectral_tension.

   * Purpose: align learning with the idea that a good mechanism library should have cross family explanatory power.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline several architectural patterns that reuse Q036 components.

1. `HTC_TensionHead`

   * Role: a module that maps internal embeddings for a high Tc context to estimates of

     * `DeltaS_pair`,
     * `DeltaS_phase`,
     * combined `DeltaS_HTC`.

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal representations of text, equations, and data summaries about a high Tc system.
     * Outputs: a small vector of spectral_tension values and an optional decomposition into contributions.

2. `PhaseDiagramConsistencyFilter`

   * Role: a filter that checks whether predicted or proposed phase diagrams are compatible with a fixed mechanism library under the encoding.

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: proposed phase diagram fragments and a pointer to mechanism templates.
     * Outputs: consistency scores or masks that guide the main model toward or away from given explanations.

3. `MechanismLibrarySelector`

   * Role: an auxiliary module that proposes which mechanism templates in `L_mech` are most plausible for a given material, without changing the library itself.

   * Interface:

     * Inputs: internal state describing material family, known observables, and context.
     * Outputs: a probability distribution over mechanism templates, used for conditioning other modules.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

We propose an evaluation harness for AI models augmented with Q036 style modules.

1. Task selection

   * Select a benchmark of tasks that involve

     * explaining high Tc phenomenology,
     * contrasting mechanism proposals,
     * predicting qualitative trends under changes in doping or pressure.

2. Conditions

   * Baseline condition:

     * The AI model operates without explicit Q036 tension heads or filters. It answers questions based on its general knowledge.

   * TU augmented condition:

     * The AI model uses `HTC_TensionHead`, `PhaseDiagramConsistencyFilter`, and `MechanismLibrarySelector` as auxiliary tools.

3. Metrics

   * Explanatory coherence:

     * How consistently the model uses the same mechanism story when asked related questions about the same material family.

   * Cross family reuse:

     * How often the model reuses compatible mechanism stories across families when it claims that a unified mechanism is at work.

   * Counterfactual robustness:

     * How cleanly the model separates reasoning under World T prompts from reasoning under World F prompts.

4. Logging

   * For each task, log

     * the prompts,
     * the raw answers,
     * the spectral_tension scores and a short structured explanation.

   * Logs should allow analysis of failure modes without exposing any TU core generative rules.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the effect of Q036 style encodings on AI explanations.

*Baseline setup:*

* Prompt the model to

  * explain why high temperature superconductivity is difficult to understand,
  * list proposed mechanisms,
  * discuss phase diagram features,

  without any mention of tension or TU encodings.

* Observation:

  * record whether explanations are fragmented, mix incompatible stories, or ignore important correlations between microscopic spectra and macroscopic phases.

*TU encoded setup:*

* Prompt the model with the same questions, plus an instruction to

  * treat “mechanism library versus spectrum and phase diagram” as a spectral_tension problem,
  * avoid using mutually incompatible mechanism stories for the same family,
  * describe low spectral_tension and high spectral_tension scenarios explicitly.

* Observation:

  * record whether explanations become more structured, with clearer links between microscopic mechanisms and macroscopic behavior.

*Comparison metric:*

* Use a rubric that rates

  * internal coherence of the mechanism story,
  * explicit linking of spectra, mechanisms, and phase diagrams,
  * stability of explanations under small prompt variations.

*What to log:*

* For both setups, log prompts, full responses, and any tension scores produced by the `HTC_TensionHead` or related modules, without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes the reusable components produced by Q036 and how they transfer to other problems.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `StrongCorrelationSpectrum_Descriptor`

   * Type: field

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: internal representation of a strongly correlated system and a specification of energy and momentum windows.
     * Output: a fixed length vector summarizing relevant spectral features and correlation patterns.

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must describe a system whose spectral data can be mapped into the descriptor format without divergence or incoherence.

2. ComponentName: `MechanismLibrary_TensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: mechanism library `L_mech`, spectral and phase diagram descriptors from `StrongCorrelationSpectrum_Descriptor` and related maps.
     * Output: a nonnegative scalar `DeltaS_HTC` representing mechanism library spectral_tension for the given configuration.

   * Preconditions:

     * Mechanism library is finite and admissible as defined in Section 3.2.

3. ComponentName: `CounterfactualMechanismWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: mechanism library `L_mech`, encoding class `E_HTC`, and a set of candidate material families.
     * Output: a pair of world definitions (World T like, World F like) with associated spectral_tension based experiments similar to those in Section 6.

   * Preconditions:

     * Input families must admit coherent encoding of spectra and phase diagrams at the effective layer.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q030 (Quantum phases of matter)

   * Reused component: `StrongCorrelationSpectrum_Descriptor`.

   * Why it transfers: many quantum phase problems require a compact representation of strongly correlated spectra that can be plugged into other tension functionals.

   * What changes: phase diagram descriptors are generalized beyond superconductivity to include other orders.

2. Q065 (Room temperature superconductivity design)

   * Reused component: `MechanismLibrary_TensionFunctional` and `CounterfactualMechanismWorld_Template`.

   * Why it transfers: room temperature design problems must evaluate how candidate materials reduce mechanism spectral_tension while satisfying practical constraints.

   * What changes: target families include hypothetical compounds and design spaces rather than only existing materials.

3. Q032 (Quantum thermodynamics of complex materials)

   * Reused component: `StrongCorrelationSpectrum_Descriptor`.

   * Why it transfers: the same spectral descriptors can be used to define thermodynamic spectral_tension between microscopic quantum states and macroscopic heat transport or entropy production laws.

   * What changes: tension functionals are now formulated in terms of thermodynamic observables instead of superconducting properties.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q036 is positioned along the TU verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

* E_level: E1

  * Q036 has a coherent effective encoding:

    * state space with hybrid semantics, admissible encoding class, mechanism library constraints,
    * mismatch observables `DeltaS_pair`, `DeltaS_phase`, and combined `DeltaS_HTC`,
    * spectral_tension tensor packaging via `T_ij(m; E)`,
    * singular sets and domain restrictions.

  * Experiments are specified that can falsify or support particular encodings in `E_HTC`.

* N_level: N1

  * The narrative that links

    * microscopic mechanism libraries,
    * spectra and phase diagrams,
    * spectral_tension functionals and counterfactual worlds,

    is explicit and internally consistent at the effective layer.

  * The canonical physics problem remains open, consistent with the metadata `Status: Encoded_E1_Open`.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be realized:

1. A prototype implementation of an admissible encoding `E` for a small set of high Tc families, including

   * concrete feature maps for spectra and phase diagrams,
   * a specified finite mechanism library,
   * computation of `DeltaS_HTC` and spectral_tension profiles that are released as open data.

2. A documented study that applies Experiment 1 across several families, with

   * fixed mechanism library and weights,
   * explicit spectral_tension thresholds,
   * clear reporting of failures and successes.

Both steps can be executed without exposing any deep TU generative rule. They operate purely on observable summaries and finite encodings.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q036 is expected to serve as:

* a reference node for spectral_tension problems in strongly correlated quantum matter,
* a template for how to represent “mechanism identification” as a spectral_tension problem rather than as a binary assertion that the mechanism has been found,
* a bridge between microscopic condensed matter theory, materials design, and AI systems that reason about such problems using WFGY style encodings.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives an explanation suitable for non experts, while staying faithful to the effective layer description.

In everyday language, the high temperature superconductivity problem is this:

> We know some materials can carry electric current with zero resistance at relatively high temperatures, much higher than older theories can easily explain. We want to know what is really happening inside the material that makes this possible, not just in one compound, but across entire families of materials.

There are many proposed microscopic stories. Some say that pairs of electrons are glued together by certain kinds of spin fluctuations. Others emphasize the role of strong electron repulsion in a lattice that almost becomes an insulator. Still others point to complicated multiorbital effects. It is not clear whether there is one main story with small variations, or many unrelated stories.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not pick a favorite mechanism. Instead, we ask:

* For each material, what do its spectra, phase diagrams, and unusual normal state properties look like when summarized in a compact way?
* If we fix a small library of candidate microscopic mechanisms, how well can that library explain all of these features at once?

For each material and each level of detail, we measure

* how far its pairing related features are from any template in the mechanism library,
* how far its phase diagram is from what those templates would predict.

We combine these into a single number. That number is the high Tc spectral_tension for that material under that library.

Then we imagine two kinds of worlds:

* In a low spectral_tension world, there is a small set of mechanism templates that keep this spectral_tension small and stable as we add more materials and more detailed data.

* In a high spectral_tension world, no matter which finite mechanism library we pick, some materials always refuse to fit, and the spectral_tension stays high or even grows as we look more closely.

This way of looking at the problem does not tell us directly which microscopic mechanism is true. It does something more controlled. It

* defines observables and encodings that capture what “fitting a mechanism” actually means,

* allows experiments and data analysis to falsify specific mechanism libraries,

* and produces reusable components that can be applied to other problems where microscopic spectra and macroscopic phases must agree.

Q036 is the node in the BlackHole graph that holds this spectral_tension based description of the high Tc mechanism problem. It does so without specifying any hidden rules for how internal TU fields are generated from raw data, and it provides a structured way to test future mechanism proposals against the combined weight of spectra and phases.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an effective layer encoding of the high temperature superconductivity mechanism problem and its associated spectral_tension structures.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical microscopic mechanism in condensed matter physics.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the microscopic mechanism of high temperature superconductivity has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, descriptors, invariants, spectral_tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer.
* No TU core axiom system, generative rule, or deep field is exposed or constructed in this page.
* All falsifiability statements concern encodings and mechanism libraries inside the admissible classes, not the underlying quantum many body theory itself.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)
