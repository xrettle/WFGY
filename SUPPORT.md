# Support WFGY

WFGY is an open, MIT-licensed structural reasoning framework.
It is built to help engineers debug complex AI systems, run safer experiments, and explore new ways of organizing reasoning itself.

This page exists for a simple reason:
if WFGY has helped you in any practical way, and you would like to push this work further, here is a stable place to support its development.

## Why support this project?

Building and maintaining a system like WFGY is not just about writing a single library or a one-off paper.

It requires:

- Designing and refining the core reasoning engine over many iterations  
- Maintaining example pipelines, demos, and reference integrations  
- Writing and updating documentation so that new users can actually adopt the ideas  
- Running experiments, stress tests, and benchmarks on real-world use cases  
- Reviewing community feedback and adjusting the design so it stays useful, not theoretical  

All of this takes time, focus, and long-term commitment.

If you choose to donate, you are not “buying a feature”.  
You are helping keep an independent, open, and experimental project moving forward, instead of disappearing when it becomes too expensive to maintain.

## How to support

Right now, the simplest way to support WFGY is via crypto donations.
Fiat options such as GitHub Sponsors / PayPal are being set up and may be added as they become stable.

You can also reach out directly if you prefer to coordinate in another way:

- Email (general donations / questions): **donate@onestardao.com**

## After you donate

If you make a donation and would like to:

- Be acknowledged as a supporter, or  
- Quietly confirm that the funds arrived correctly, or  
- Discuss specific areas you want to see WFGY focus on,

you can email:

**donate@onestardao.com**

Optionally include:

- The transaction hash  
- The network used (BTC / TRON / ERC20 / BEP20)  
- Any note on how you are using WFGY or what you would like to see improved  

There is no guarantee of any special feature or priority, but feedback from real users is extremely valuable and will influence how the project evolves.

## Thank you

Independent, open projects live or die on whether people actually find them useful enough to keep them alive.

If you are reading this page, it already means you cared enough to check how to support.
Whether or not you donate, using WFGY seriously, giving feedback, and sharing it with other engineers are all forms of support.

Thank you for helping this project continue to exist as a public, MIT-licensed resource.
