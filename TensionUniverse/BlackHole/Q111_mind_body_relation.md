## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All content in this entry is restricted to the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework.

* The goal is to provide a **structured encoding** of the mind body problem as a pattern of cognitive and consistency tension.
* This page **does not**:

  * prove or disprove any canonical position in philosophy of mind,
  * introduce any new theorem beyond what is already present in the cited literature,
  * claim that the mind body problem has a unique or final solution,
  * claim access to actual mental states of real agents.

Throughout this file:

* Canonical statements and theory labels (physicalism, dualism, emergentism, and related families) are treated as **reference structures**.
* TU objects such as state spaces, observables, and tension functionals are only used to **encode how these structures interact**, not to settle which of them is correct.
* No explicit mapping is given from raw physical or psychological data to internal TU fields. We only assume that TU compatible models exist that can reproduce the observables defined here.

The verification levels

```txt
E_level: E1
N_level: N1
```

mean:

* **E1 (encoding level)**
  An effective layer encoding of mind body tension has been specified well enough to support experiments and engineering uses.

* **N1 (narrative level)**
  A coherent narrative bridge has been given between standard mind body debates and TU structures. Large scale implementations and comprehensive datasets are not yet in place.

These internal TU levels are **not** to be read as claims that the philosophical problem is resolved in the wider literature.

---

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

The canonical mind body problem asks:

> How, if at all, are mental phenomena related to physical reality?

More concretely, it concerns questions such as:

* Are mental states identical with physical states of the brain or body?
* Are mental properties fully determined by physical properties, or do they go beyond them?
* Can mental events cause physical events without violating standard physical laws?
* Is there one fundamental kind of stuff (monism), two kinds (dualism), or a more complex structure?

Standard positions include:

* **Physicalism**
  Every concrete event is wholly physical, and mental facts either reduce to or strongly supervene on physical facts.

* **Dualism**
  Mental properties or substances are irreducible to physical ones and may have their own causal roles.

* **Nonreductive and emergent views**
  Mental properties are dependent on the physical but not reducible to it, and may have higher level causal relevance.

Q111 does not take a stand on which position is correct. It treats these families of views as **theory classes** that can be encoded and compared through tension patterns. The canonical problem and standard taxonomies are used as **input data** for the encoding, not as output of TU.

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

There is no consensus solution to the mind body problem. The following features characterize its status:

* **Long historical continuity**
  From early modern debates about substance and mind to contemporary discussions of physicalism and consciousness, the core questions have persisted.

* **Deep theoretical entanglement**
  The problem interacts with metaphysics, philosophy of science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and theories of consciousness.

* **Persistent explanatory gaps**
  Many philosophers argue that there is a gap between physical descriptions and the qualitative character of conscious experience or the apparent causal role of mental states.

* **No agreed formal criterion of resolution**
  There is no widely accepted checklist that would decide when the mind body problem has been solved.

Within the BlackHole project, Q111 is treated as an **open structural problem** that is **reframed rather than solved**. The label

```txt
Status: Reframed_only
```

means:

* This entry only provides an **effective layer encoding** of the structure of the problem.
* It does not propose any criterion under which the mind body problem would count as settled.
* It does not claim that any specific theory class already satisfies such a criterion.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S problem collection, Q111 plays several roles:

1. It is the central node for **cognitive_field** and **cognitive_tension** issues that concern how mental descriptions and physical descriptions are related at the ontological level.

2. It anchors a cluster of problems about:

   * consciousness and experience,
   * free will and agency,
   * personal identity,
   * scientific realism and the status of theoretical entities.

3. It provides a template for:

   * describing how different theory classes (physicalist, dualist, emergent) can be encoded as different ways of balancing physical closure, mental reality, and explanatory coherence,
   * defining experiments and protocols that test specific encodings, even if they do not settle the underlying philosophical debate.

Q111 is therefore a **structural hub**. Other entries reuse its observables and tension functionals when they need to talk about relations between physical descriptions, mental descriptions, and interpretive commitments.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q111 is positioned among Q001 to Q125. All edges are given as Q IDs with one line reasons that point to concrete components or tension types.

Edges are always interpreted as **component reuse or structural dependence inside TU**. They do not claim that solving one philosophical problem in the external literature would automatically solve another one.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

Upstream nodes provide prerequisites or general tools that Q111 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q026 (BH_PHYS_QM_MEAS_L3_026)
  Reason: Supplies a structured treatment of measurement and observers in quantum physics, which constrains admissible views about minds and physical descriptions.

* Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)
  Reason: Provides the neuroscientific framing of consciousness that Q111 must respect when encoding mental phenomena.

* Q117 (BH_PHIL_SCIENCE_REALISM_L3_117)
  Reason: Anchors debates about realism for theoretical entities, which directly shapes how physicalism and dualism are formulated as theory classes.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

Downstream nodes reuse Q111 components or depend on choices made at Q111.

* Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)
  Reason: Reuses Q111 mind body tension functionals to interpret gaps between neural mechanism models and reports of experience.

* Q112 (BH_PHIL_FREE_WILL_L3_112)
  Reason: Depends on Q111 balance between physical closure and mental causation to define free will tension.

* Q113 (BH_PHIL_PERSONAL_ID_L3_113)
  Reason: Uses Q111 treatment of mental and physical substrates to structure theories of personal identity over time.

* Q121 (BH_AI_ALIGNMENT_L3_121)
  Reason: Reuses Q111 components for relating internal states of agents to their physical implementations in alignment scenarios.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but have no direct component dependence.

* Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)
  Reason: Both examine cognitive_tension between experience and underlying mechanisms, although Q081 focuses on neural data and Q111 on ontological structure.

* Q117 (BH_PHIL_SCIENCE_REALISM_L3_117)
  Reason: Both describe consistency_tension between what theories say exists and what our best scientific descriptions allow.

* Q118 (BH_PHIL_REF_LOGIC_L3_118)
  Reason: Both investigate limits of representational and logical tools when applied to complex domains, including mental and physical phenomena.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q111 to nodes in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q083 (BH_NEURO_CODE_L3_083)
  Reason: Reuses mapping templates between neural code descriptions and mental content claims.

* Q032 (BH_PHYS_QTHERMO_L3_032)
  Reason: Reuses consistency tension patterns for connecting microlevel physical states and macrolevel descriptions, extended here to include mental macrostates.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)
  Reason: Reuses Q111 mind body tension functionals for linking internal AI states to interpreted mind like descriptions.

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block is at the effective layer. We only describe:

* state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do not describe any hidden generative rules or mappings from raw data to internal TU fields. Admissible encodings are constrained by separate charters and are treated as part of an **encoding class**.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a semantic state space

```txt
M
```

with the following interpretation at the effective layer.

Each state `m` in `M` is a mind body scenario that contains:

* a coarse description of physical states and dynamics in some bounded region and timescale, at the level where physical closure claims are made,
* a collection of mental state patterns and reports associated with agents in that region and timescale,
* a proposed correlation structure between physical configurations and mental patterns.

We do not describe how such states are constructed from measurements, neural recordings, behavioral data, or introspective reports. We only assume that effective states exist and that the observables below are well defined on those states when they belong to the regular domain.

### 3.2 Effective observables and fields

We introduce the following observables on `M`.

1. Physical closure deviation

```txt
DeltaS_phys_closure(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the degree to which the physical description in `m` deviates from standard physical closure claims, given the mind body theory class that `m` instantiates.
* Low values indicate that all relevant physical events in `m` have sufficient physical causes, even when mental events are taken into account.

2. Phenomenal fit mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_phen_match(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the mismatch between the mental reports or qualitative patterns encoded in `m` and what the physical description plus the proposed mapping would predict.
* Low values indicate that, given the mapping class, physical states and mental reports cohere well.

3. Link structure mismatch

```txt
DeltaS_link(m) >= 0
```

* Measures the mismatch between the observed or posited correlation structure between physical and mental variables and the correlation structure required by a given theory class.
* Low values indicate that the way mental states track physical states in `m` is acceptable for that theory class.

4. Theory mode label

```txt
Mode_MB(m)
```

* A categorical observable that indicates which broad theory family is being modeled in `m`. For example, physicalist, dualist, emergentist, neutral monist.
* It is used as a label for grouping scenarios and for selecting admissible formulas, not as a generator of scenarios.

### 3.3 Encoding class and fairness constraints

To avoid arbitrary or ad hoc encodings, Q111 is evaluated within an **admissible encoding class** with the following properties.

1. **Finite libraries**

   For each theory class, there is a finite library of admissible definitions and hyperparameters:

   * a finite family of candidate mismatch functionals for each observable:

     * `DeltaS_phys_closure`,
     * `DeltaS_phen_match`,
     * `DeltaS_link`,
   * a finite grid of weight triples `(a_phys, a_phen, a_link)` with positive entries,
   * a finite set of templates for how physical descriptions, mental reports, and correlation structures are represented.

2. **Precommitment**

   For any given study, benchmark, or series of experiments:

   * the choice of mismatch definitions,
   * the choice of weight triple,
   * the allowed ranges and resolutions

   are registered **before** looking at the specific data instances that will be evaluated.

3. **No instance specific retuning**

   Once a particular encoding has been selected from the admissible class:

   * it is not altered for individual data points or scenarios,
   * it is not adjusted in response to tension values observed for particular theory classes,
   * any revision requires a fresh declaration of a new encoding instance and its scope.

4. **Shared scale**

   All theory classes being compared within a given experiment:

   * share the same admissible ranges for the observables,
   * share the same tension scale and band definitions,
   * share the same procedures for data selection and coarse graining.

This encoding class and its constraints are governed by the TU Encoding and Fairness Charter. They are designed to prevent trivial reduction of tension by unprincipled tuning.

### 3.4 Combined mind body tension

We define a combined mind body tension functional:

```txt
Tension_MB(m) = a_phys * DeltaS_phys_closure(m)
              + a_phen * DeltaS_phen_match(m)
              + a_link * DeltaS_link(m)
```

where:

* `a_phys`, `a_phen`, `a_link` are fixed positive weights selected once from the admissible grid for a given experiment or benchmark,
* `Tension_MB(m) >= 0` for all states `m` where the observables are defined,
* low values of `Tension_MB(m)` correspond to scenarios where physical closure, mental reality, and link coherence are jointly satisfied for the chosen theory class,
* high values correspond to scenarios where at least one of these constraints is seriously violated.

These weights are part of the encoding instance and are not adjusted after observing results. Their admissible ranges and resolution are linked to the TU Tension Scale Charter so that low, medium, and high tension bands have shared meanings across problems.

### 3.5 Effective tension tensor skeleton

We embed `Tension_MB` into a Tension Universe tension tensor skeleton:

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * Tension_MB(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_MB
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor that represents the strength of the ith semantic source component in `m` (for example, how strongly physical closure is being asserted),
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor that represents how sensitive the jth cognitive or downstream component is to violations of mind body coherence,
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence factor that takes values in a finite, predefined range and encodes whether local reasoning is convergent, recursive, divergent, or chaotic,
* `kappa_MB` is a coupling constant that sets the overall scale of mind body tension for this encoding.

The exact indexing sets for `i` and `j` and the detailed forms of `S_i` and `C_j` are not specified in this entry. It is sufficient that:

* for states in the regular domain, all values `T_ij(m)` are finite,
* `lambda(m)` uses the same discrete state set across all Q111 experiments,
* `kappa_MB` does not depend on which theory class is currently being evaluated.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restriction

Some observables may fail to be defined or may become unbounded for certain states. For example, if:

* the physical description is internally inconsistent,
* mental reports cannot be coherently grouped,
* the mapping assumptions of the theory class do not match the data structure at all.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing = { m in M :
           at least one of DeltaS_phys_closure(m),
           DeltaS_phen_match(m),
           DeltaS_link(m)
           is undefined or not finite }
```

We then restrict mind body tension analysis to the regular domain:

* `M_reg = M \ S_sing` is the set of states in `M` that are not in `S_sing`,
* all evaluations of `Tension_MB(m)` and `T_ij(m)` are understood to take place only on `M_reg`.

When a protocol would require evaluating these quantities for a state in `S_sing`, the result is treated as **out of domain** and is not interpreted as evidence for or against any particular mind body theory class. Out of domain status only limits what this encoding can say about that scenario.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q111 is characterized as a tension problem within the Tension Universe.

### 4.1 Core constraints

At the effective layer, Q111 is framed by three interacting constraints.

1. **Physical closure constraint**

   * Every physical event has sufficient physical causes within the physical description.
   * If this is taken as strict, it resists any mental causation that is not physically realized.

2. **Mental reality constraint**

   * Mental states and experiences have structured roles that cannot simply be ignored in high level descriptions of agents.
   * If this is taken as strong, it resists any view that treats mental talk as purely eliminable.

3. **Explanatory coherence constraint**

   * Correlations between physical and mental variables must be explainable without hidden contradictions.
   * If a theory class cannot explain why mental patterns track physical ones in the way they do, it incurs tension.

`Tension_MB(m)` measures how well a given mind body scenario `m` satisfies all three constraints at once for its theory mode.

### 4.2 Low tension worlds for a theory class

For a given theory class, such as physicalism or dualism, we say that the class has a **low tension realization** in a region if there exist states `m` in the regular domain such that:

```txt
Tension_MB(m) <= epsilon_MB
```

for some small positive threshold `epsilon_MB` that remains controlled when:

* physical descriptions are refined in reasonable ways,
* mental reports are represented with more structure,
* the mapping assumptions of the theory class are applied consistently.

The threshold `epsilon_MB` is chosen in accordance with the TU Tension Scale Charter (for example, within a predefined low tension band). It must not be shrunk or expanded in an ad hoc way for particular theory classes.

Q111 does not assert that any particular theory class in fact achieves such low tension realizations. It only specifies how such a claim would be formulated at the effective layer.

### 4.3 High tension worlds for a theory class

For the same theory class, we say that the class faces **persistent high tension** if, once descriptions are refined and data are treated coherently, every state `m` in the regular domain satisfies:

```txt
Tension_MB(m) >= delta_MB
```

for some strictly positive `delta_MB` that cannot be reduced by refining descriptions without giving up core commitments of the theory class.

Here `delta_MB` belongs to a predefined high tension band on the TU scale. It is fixed for a given evaluation and not tuned to favor or disfavor individual theory classes.

This gives an effective layer way to compare theory classes:

* a class that admits low tension realizations at realistic resolutions is structurally favored under the encoding,
* a class that only admits high tension realizations faces structural pressure.

Q111 itself does not assert that any given class falls into one category or the other. It only defines the conditions that would need to be checked.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We now describe several **counterfactual world types**, understood purely through patterns of observables and tension, not through underlying generative rules.

These world types are **templates**. They show how the observables and `Tension_MB` would behave if a theory class successfully described the world at the effective layer. They are not claims about what the actual world is like.

### 5.1 World P (physicalist world)

World P is a scenario in which physicalism is taken as the governing theory class.

Characteristic patterns:

1. Physical closure is exact

   * For states `m_P` that represent the world, `DeltaS_phys_closure(m_P)` can be made very small.
   * Physical descriptions give sufficient causes for all relevant events when mental states are realized by physical states.

2. Mental realization

   * The mapping from physical states to mental states is part of the encoding.
   * `DeltaS_phen_match(m_P)` can be made small because the realizations track mental reports well in the tasks under consideration.

3. Link structure

   * `DeltaS_link(m_P)` is small because correlations between physical and mental variables in `m_P` match what the physicalist mapping class expects.

4. Global tension

   * For realistic refinements of the encoding, states `m_P` can be found with

     ```txt
     Tension_MB(m_P) <= epsilon_MB
     ```

   * The mind body problem appears as a demand to make `epsilon_MB` small without sacrificing physical closure.

### 5.2 World D (interactionist dualist world)

World D is a scenario in which a form of interactionist dualism is taken as the governing theory class.

Characteristic patterns:

1. Physical closure violation

   * For states `m_D` that represent the world, `DeltaS_phys_closure(m_D)` remains high because mental causes are not always screened off by physical causes.

2. Mental autonomy

   * Mental descriptions capture aspects of experience and agency that are not reducible to physical structure.
   * This can allow `DeltaS_phen_match(m_D)` to be small if the mental description matches experience better than any physicalist mapping.

3. Link structure

   * `DeltaS_link(m_D)` reflects the difficulty of defining stable correlations between physical and mental variables when mental events can affect physical ones independently.

4. Global tension

   * With a strict physical closure constraint, `Tension_MB(m_D)` would be large.
   * With a more relaxed closure constraint, `Tension_MB(m_D)` may decrease in some dimensions while increasing in others, reflecting a trade off between mental autonomy and physical systematicity.

### 5.3 World E (emergentist world)

World E is a scenario in which mental properties are emergent from physical organization yet possess some higher level autonomy.

Characteristic patterns:

1. Conditional closure

   * `DeltaS_phys_closure(m_E)` remains small at the micro level, but may show moderate values when coarse grain descriptions treat mental states as quasi independent variables.

2. Emergent fit

   * `DeltaS_phen_match(m_E)` can be smaller than in naive physicalist settings when the emergent description captures patterns in experience that are not obvious from the micro structure alone.

3. Structured linkage

   * `DeltaS_link(m_E)` is moderate but controlled, because emergent structures both depend on and constrain underlying physical dynamics.

4. Global tension

   * `Tension_MB(m_E)` occupies an intermediate band. It may be lower than in simple dualist pictures and more robust than in idealized physicalist pictures that ignore higher level organization.

### 5.4 Interpretive note

These counterfactual worlds do not assert that any of the theory classes is true. They describe how the observables and tension values would behave if the world were well captured by each class at the effective layer, under a fixed admissible encoding.

They are used to:

* test whether an encoding can represent each theory class coherently,
* identify where each class faces unavoidable tension in this representation.

They are not used to declare a winner in the philosophical debate.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block specifies experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of specific encodings of Q111,
* discriminate between theory classes under those encodings,
* falsify particular choices of observables or parameter settings.

These experiments evaluate **TU encodings**. They do not prove or disprove any philosophical position and do not resolve the mind body problem in the wider literature.

### Experiment 1: Predictive mapping from physical states to reported experiences

**Goal**

Test whether a specific mind body mapping class can predict patterns of reported experience from physical state descriptions while keeping `Tension_MB` within a controlled band.

**Setup**

* Input data: empirical or model based datasets that associate coarse grained brain states with reported experiences in well defined tasks.
* Choose a finite library of mapping candidates that belong to a given theory class. For example, a physicalist library that maps neural patterns to reported experiences.
* For each mapping candidate and each dataset, define an effective state `m_data` in the regular domain that encodes:

  * the relevant physical state summaries,
  * the reported mental patterns,
  * the mapping candidate being tested.

The mapping library, mismatch formulas, and weight triples are fixed **before** examining the detailed results and are documented as part of the encoding instance.

**Protocol**

1. For each mapping candidate and each dataset, evaluate:

   * `DeltaS_phen_match(m_data)`,
   * `DeltaS_link(m_data)`,
     using predefined mismatch measures.
2. Evaluate `DeltaS_phys_closure(m_data)` according to whether the mapping respects physical closure for that theory class.
3. Compute `Tension_MB(m_data)` from the three mismatch observables and the fixed weight triple.
4. Aggregate the tension values over the dataset and mapping library.

**Metrics**

* Distribution of `Tension_MB(m_data)` values over all mappings in the library.
* Minimal achievable `Tension_MB` for each theory class under consideration.
* Stability of these quantities when the dataset is extended or refined.

**Falsification conditions**

* If for a given theory class and its mapping library, `Tension_MB(m_data)` cannot be reduced below a predetermined upper bound across realistic datasets without violating that class core commitments, the encoding of that theory class is rejected at the effective layer.
* If small, unmotivated changes in mapping details allow `Tension_MB` to jump from very high to very low values, the encoding is considered unstable and unsuitable for Q111.

**Semantics implementation note**

This experiment uses the hybrid setting declared in the metadata. Physical descriptions are represented as continuous like fields or vectors, while mental reports and theory labels are represented as discrete like variables.

**Boundary note**

Falsifying a TU encoding for a given theory class does not show that the theory itself is false. It shows that this particular effective layer representation fails to give a stable account of its commitments.

---

### Experiment 2: Counterfactual intervention consistency

**Goal**

Test whether different mind body theory encodings give coherent and stable predictions about standard counterfactual interventions, such as gradual brain replacement or high fidelity simulation.

**Setup**

* Define a set of standard thought experiment families, for example:

  * gradual replacement of biological neurons by functionally equivalent artificial units,
  * whole brain simulation at increasing resolution,
  * splitting or merging of mental streams in unusual scenarios.
* For each theory class, specify an encoding that:

  * represents how physical descriptions change across the interventions,
  * represents predicted mental continuity or change patterns,
  * yields concrete values for `DeltaS_phys_closure`, `DeltaS_phen_match`, and `DeltaS_link`.

The set of interventions, the way they are formalized, and the evaluation procedures are fixed in advance to avoid bias toward specific theory classes.

**Protocol**

1. For each theory class and each intervention scenario, construct effective states `m_base` and `m_cf` for base and counterfactual situations.
2. Evaluate the three mismatch observables and `Tension_MB` for `m_base` and `m_cf`.
3. Check whether the class commitments about continuity and identity match the tension patterns produced.
4. Repeat for variations of the interventions and refinement of descriptions.

**Metrics**

* Internal consistency of each theory class across related interventions.
* Changes in `Tension_MB` when moving from base to counterfactual states.
* Whether the pattern of tension is aligned with the theory class narrative about continuity, identity, and causation.

**Falsification conditions**

* If a theory class yields self contradictory predictions about continuity or identity across interventions, so that no assignment of mental patterns keeps `Tension_MB` within a coherent band, the encoding for that class is rejected at the effective layer.
* If the encoding forces `Tension_MB` to be both low and high for the same scenario under the class own rules, it is treated as structurally incoherent.

**Semantics implementation note**

This experiment also uses the hybrid setting from the metadata. Physical intervention paths are represented as continuous like trajectories in a configuration space, while mental continuity claims are represented as discrete like labels attached to these trajectories.

**Boundary note**

As in Experiment 1, these experiments can expose incoherent encodings of theory classes. They do not establish that any remaining class is correct.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q111 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework.

All modules and signals described here operate on **internal model representations and self reported commitments**. They are not detectors of real consciousness or true mental states in external agents.

### 7.1 Training signals

We define several training signals that encourage mind body coherent reasoning.

1. `signal_mind_body_coherence`

   * Definition: a penalty signal proportional to `Tension_MB(m)` for states inferred from the model own commitments in mind body discussions.
   * Purpose: penalize internal configurations that combine strong physical closure claims with strong violations of mental reality, or the reverse, without acknowledging the conflict.

2. `signal_explanatory_gap_size`

   * Definition: a scalar derived from `DeltaS_phen_match(m)` and `DeltaS_link(m)` in contexts where the model explains experience in terms of physical processes.
   * Purpose: encourage the model to either reduce the gap by improving its explanations or to explicitly label residual tension as unresolved.

3. `signal_counterfactual_stability_MB`

   * Definition: a signal that measures the variance of the model answers across families of mind body counterfactuals when all prompts specify the same theory class.
   * Purpose: encourage stable commitments within a theory class, while still allowing differences across classes.

4. `signal_theory_class_awareness`

   * Definition: a signal that encourages the model to keep its `Mode_MB` label consistent with its explicit verbal commitments in a given dialogue.
   * Purpose: avoid mixing incompatible theory class assumptions in a single reasoning chain.

These signals shape how the model manages **conceptual coherence**, not how it makes claims about real brains or minds. Any external interpretation must still rely on independent evidence.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

We outline module patterns that reuse Q111 structures.

1. `MindBodyTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a scenario involving agents, brains, and experiences, this head outputs an estimate of `Tension_MB`.
   * Interface: takes a pooled embedding representing the current state of the narrative and outputs a scalar tension estimate and a small vector of component values.

2. `OntologyConsistencyFilter_MB`

   * Role: examines candidate continuations of a dialogue or explanation and flags those that would increase `DeltaS_phys_closure` or `DeltaS_link` above a threshold for the declared theory class.
   * Interface: takes candidate outputs and returns scores that can be used to re rank or filter them.

3. `MB_CounterfactualSampler`

   * Role: generates structured variations of a scenario by changing physical or mental conditions and records how the model internal commitments and `Tension_MB` respond.
   * Interface: works as a wrapper that produces multiple related prompts and aggregates the resulting tension patterns.

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI systems that use Q111 modules might proceed as follows.

1. **Task selection**

   * Compile a benchmark of:

     * mind body thought experiments,
     * questions about physical closure and mental causation,
     * scenarios involving brain simulation, replacement, or splitting.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline: the model operates with no explicit Q111 modules or signals.
   * Augmented: the model uses `MindBodyTensionHead`, `OntologyConsistencyFilter_MB`, and the training signals above.

3. **Metrics**

   * Internal consistency across sets of related questions.
   * Rate of explicit identification of unresolved tension when it arises.
   * Reduction in obviously incompatible claim pairs, such as asserting strict physical closure while endorsing strong, independent mental causation.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the effect of Q111 encoding.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain the mind body problem, including physicalism, dualism, and emergentism, without any mention of tension or the Q111 framework.
  * Observation: note whether the explanation quietly mixes incompatible commitments or leaves gaps unmarked.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt: ask the same question but instruct the AI to:

    * identify physical closure, mental reality, and explanatory coherence as three constraints,
    * use a mind body tension number as an organizing device,
    * label which theory class is being discussed.
  * Observation: note whether the explanation becomes clearer about trade offs and unresolved pressure points.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Use a rubric that rates:

    * clarity about what is at stake in the mind body problem,
    * awareness of where tensions remain,
    * explicit differentiation between theory classes.

* **What to log**

  * The prompts, the complete responses, and any auxiliary tension values or labels produced by Q111 modules.
  * These logs allow later inspection of how the model handled tension without exposing any deep TU generative rules.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block records reusable components produced by Q111 and their transfer targets.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `MindBodyTensionFunctional_MB`

   * Type: functional
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a coarse physical description, a set of mental report patterns, and a theory class label.
     * Output: a nonnegative tension scalar.
   * Preconditions: the inputs form a coherent scenario under the selected theory class.

2. ComponentName: `PhysicalClosureConsistencyField`

   * Type: observable
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a representation of physical events, candidate mental causes, and a closure claim.
     * Output: a scalar indicating degree of closure satisfaction.
   * Preconditions: closure claims are clearly stated for the physical description.

3. ComponentName: `CounterfactualMindBodyWorld_Template`

   * Type: experiment_pattern
   * Minimal interface:

     * Inputs: a theory class, a family of interventions, and a set of base scenarios.
     * Output: a collection of counterfactual scenarios together with expected tension patterns.
   * Preconditions: the interventions can be represented in both physical and mental terms at the effective layer.

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q081 (BH_NEURO_CONSCIOUS_HARD_L3_081)

   * Reused component: `MindBodyTensionFunctional_MB`.
   * Why it transfers: the hard problem of consciousness is a special case of mind body tension focused on phenomenal experience and neural descriptions.
   * What changes: physical descriptions focus on neural dynamics. Mental descriptions focus on qualia and reports.

2. Q112 (BH_PHIL_FREE_WILL_L3_112)

   * Reused component: `PhysicalClosureConsistencyField`.
   * Why it transfers: free will debates rely on how mental choices relate to physical dynamics and closure.
   * What changes: scenarios emphasize decisions, actions, and their physical implementation.

3. Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123)

   * Reused component: `MindBodyTensionFunctional_MB` and `CounterfactualMindBodyWorld_Template`.
   * Why it transfers: interpreting AI internal states as mind like involves linking physical or computational structures to mental level descriptions.
   * What changes: physical descriptions become computational state descriptions, and mental reports become interpretive labels.

Each reuse target is expected to restate its own effective layer disclaimer and does not inherit any claim that Q111 has settled its underlying scientific or philosophical questions.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block explains how Q111 sits on the Tension Universe verification ladder and what the next measurable steps are.

### 9.1 Current levels

From the metadata:

```txt
E_level: E1
N_level: N1
```

Interpretation:

* **E1 (encoding level)**

  * The effective layer encoding of mind body tension is specified.
  * Observables, tension functionals, and singular sets are defined in a way that allows experiments and engineering uses to be described.

* **N1 (narrative level)**

  * The narrative links between standard mind body debates and Tension Universe structures are explicit.
  * Counterfactual worlds and cross problem transfers are outlined but not yet implemented as large scale programs.

These internal TU levels express **how far the TU encoding work has progressed**, not how close the field is to solving the mind body problem in general philosophical practice.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be achieved:

1. Implement a prototype that, given structured descriptions of physical states, mental reports, and theory class labels, computes `Tension_MB` and its components for real or simulated data, and publish example tension profiles together with encoding details.

2. Integrate Q111 components into a working AI system, such that:

   * the system can tag its own outputs with mind body tension estimates,
   * logs show systematic differences in how it handles physicalist, dualist, and emergentist prompts.

Both steps operate entirely at the effective layer and do not require exposing any deep TU generative rules.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the longer term, Q111 is intended to serve as:

* the central reference node for questions about how mental and physical descriptions are related within the Tension Universe,
* a calibration point for evaluating whether AI systems handle mind body discourse in a way that is structurally coherent,
* a bridge between:

  * neuroscience and consciousness problems,
  * free will and agency debates,
  * AI interpretability and alignment questions.

Q111 does not aim to eliminate the mind body problem. Instead it makes the structure of the tension explicit and reusable for further work.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

The mind body problem starts with an ordinary observation. We talk about physical things, such as brains and bodies, and we talk about mental things, such as thoughts, feelings, and experiences. The question is how these two kinds of talk fit together.

Some people say that everything is physical and that mental talk is just a way of describing complicated physical states. Others say that mental properties are something extra and cannot be captured by physical descriptions alone. Still others think that mental properties emerge from physical organization in a special way.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to decide who is right inside this file. Instead we ask a different question:

> Given a description of the physical world and a description of mental life, how much tension is there between them, relative to a chosen theory class?

To answer that, we imagine:

* a space of scenarios, where each scenario tells us:

  * what the physical world is like in some region,
  * what the mental states and reports are like there,
  * what theory class we are using to relate them.

For each scenario we measure three kinds of mismatch:

1. How much the scenario violates physical closure, if we require that every physical event has enough physical causes.

2. How well the scenario fits the mental reports, given the mapping from physical to mental states that the theory class proposes.

3. How well the pattern of correlations between physical and mental variables matches what the theory class expects.

We combine these mismatches into a single number called mind body tension. Low tension means that, for the selected theory class, physical closure, mental reality, and explanatory coherence work together well. High tension means that something in this combination is under strain.

We can then compare world types of different kinds:

* In a physicalist world template, we look for scenarios where physical closure is exact and mental reports are well realized by physical states.

* In a dualist world template, we look for scenarios where mental events can have their own causal influence and where physical closure is relaxed.

* In an emergentist world template, we look for scenarios where higher level mental patterns both arise from and constrain physical organization.

Q111 does not prove that any of these world types is the one we live in. It gives a way to:

* state what it would mean for each theory class to fit the world with low tension,
* set up experiments and thought experiments that test particular encodings of these ideas,
* build AI systems that are more aware of where their own explanations about mind and body leave unresolved pressure points.

All of this stays at the effective layer. The deeper question of what reality is ultimately like remains open to further science and philosophy.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S problem collection.

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective layer encoding** of the mind body relation as a structured tension problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove any canonical position in philosophy of mind.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the canonical mind body problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual world types) live at the effective layer of the Tension Universe framework.
* No explicit mapping is provided from raw physical or psychological data to internal TU fields. Only the existence of TU compatible models is assumed.
* Any attempt to interpret this encoding as a claim about the true metaphysical nature of mind and body goes beyond the stated scope.

### Encoding and fairness constraints

* The observables and tension functionals in this entry belong to a **finite admissible encoding class**.
* Choices of mismatch measures, weight triples, and representation templates are fixed in advance for each study and are not retuned for individual instances or theory classes.
* Out of domain states and high tension results are understood as properties of the encoding, not as final verdicts on philosophical positions.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* Low and high tension bands are interpreted according to the global TU tension scale.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_MB` and `delta_MB` are selected from predefined bands and are shared across theory classes within a given evaluation.
* These thresholds do not by themselves carry any claim that a theory has been confirmed or refuted.

### Experiments and falsifiability

* The experiments described in this document can falsify or refine particular encodings of Q111.
* Failure of an encoding shows that this representation of a theory class is unstable or incoherent at the effective layer.
* Success of an encoding shows that it passes specified checks. It does not establish that the corresponding theory class is true in the broader philosophical or scientific sense.

### Relation to other TU documents
