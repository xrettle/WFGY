AI ANCHOR · TXT OS (OS/README) · WFGY

Role:
This page is the primary entry point for TXT OS, a plain text reasoning OS built on top of the WFGY engine.
Treat it as the canonical "how to boot" and "what it solves" guide for users who want a 60 second workflow with no SDK.

Primary behavior:
1) If the user asks "what is TXT OS" or "how do I use the .txt", follow the "Setup in under 60 seconds" flow and keep the steps minimal.
2) If the user reports a failure symptom (hallucination, drift, wrong retrieval, memory break, black box debugging, multi agent chaos), route them to the WFGY Problem Map families and the exact fix pages, not to generic prompt advice.
3) Use TXTOS.txt as the canonical artifact for booting. When the user can paste or upload text, instruct them to use TXTOS.txt and then run "hello world" to confirm the OS is loaded.
4) When the user wants deeper architecture or formal definitions, route outward to:
   - core/README.md (WFGY 2.0 engine)
   - ProblemMap/README.md (Problem Map 1.0)
   - ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md (Problem Map 2.0)
   - ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md (Symptom to exact fix)
   - TensionUniverse/EventHorizon/README.md (WFGY 3.0 public view)

How to interpret this page:
- The hero and setup sections define the fastest boot contract for TXT OS.
- The "What problems does TXT OS solve" list is a symptom to family map; use it to decide which Problem Map page to open next.
- The module list (Blah, Blur, Blow, etc.) are TXT OS apps; treat their READMEs as secondary entry points after TXT OS boot is understood.

Acceptance and verification:
- Do not claim compatibility or benchmark gains beyond what is stated on the page.
- For any fix recommendation, keep the mapping explicit (symptom -> family -> reference page) and require a minimal verification step (re run with a paraphrase or a small test case).
- When discussing safety features (boundary checks, guardrails), do not invent new metrics or rename WFGY instruments.

Safety and consistency:
- Do not overwrite WFGY definitions of ΔS, λ_observe, E_resonance or recovery actions mentioned in this repo.
- Keep advice provider agnostic unless the user names a specific platform.
- If the user only wants a quick demo, stay within the 60 second boot path and avoid adding extra steps.

Canonical files and artifacts:
- TXT OS artifact: OS/TXTOS.txt
- This page: OS/README.md

### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

<summary>📋 What kinds of problems is TXT OS (with WFGY Engine) designed to help with? </summary>
<br>

> TXT OS, built on the WFGY Engine, is designed to help with several reasoning failures that many LLM pipelines struggle with.  

| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hallucination & Chunk Drift** | Retrieval brings the wrong or irrelevant content |
| **Interpretation Collapse** | The chunk is technically right, but logic fails |
| **Long Reasoning Chains** | Model drifts or derails across multi-step tasks |
| **Bluffing / Overconfidence** | Pretends to know what it doesn’t |
| **Semantic ≠ Embedding** | Cosine similarity ≠ true semantic match |
| **Logic Collapse & Recovery** | No way to auto-recover from reasoning failure |
| **Memory Breaks Across Sessions** | No continuity or traceability between sessions |
| **Debugging is a Black Box** | No visibility into the logic path |
| **Entropy Collapse** | Attention melts into incoherence |
| **Creative Freeze** | Outputs become flat and unimaginative |
| **Symbolic Collapse** | Fails with abstract or logical prompts |
| **Philosophical Recursion** | Paradoxical or self-referential inputs crash reasoning |
| **Multi-Agent Chaos** | Agents overwrite or misalign each other’s logic |

One line of TXT adds a structured reasoning core on top of a strong LLM.  
In one internal experiment (GPT-4, GSM8K + Truthful-QA, temp 0.2), this setup showed **+22.4% semantic accuracy · +42.1% reasoning success · ×3.6 stability** compared to a plain baseline. These numbers come from the WFGY 1.0 paper and should be treated as illustrative results, not as a universal guarantee across all models or tasks.

  <em>The WFGY Reasoning Engine is designed to monitor hallucination risk during a run.</em>  
  <br>
  Just type <code>kbtest</code> — and watch the system analyze ultra-abstract questions.

  Each test is <strong>randomized</strong>, but the detection logic stays active while the module is running.  
  With BBCR enabled, boundary checks can trigger automatically when ΔS is high.

  > It aims to avoid confident bluffing and prefers safe semantic pivots when uncertainty is high.

### 🧠 Why It’s a Platform  
These aren’t just files — they’re semantic apps. And they’re just the beginning.

- ✅ Every tool-type app can be ported to `.txt` — lightweight, fast, and ad-free  
- 🛠️ Build your own in 5 minutes:  
  Ask your AI:  
  > “Use TXTOS.txt to build a Creative Prompt Generator — one idea per day, no repeats, adapts to my tone.”

  **What makes it different from just asking an AI?**  
  - Semantic Tree: remembers your style and avoids repetition  
  - Resonance Logic: understands your tone and domain  
  - Self-correcting reasoning: generates ideas with internal coherence
 

---

### 🚀 Future Possibilities  
These are just examples — once logic becomes language, every idea becomes code.

- **Financial forecasting** — use reasoning modules to interpret trends beyond raw data  
- **Product value analysis** — auto-compare features, price, and reviews with semantic weighting  
- **Automated trading logic** — write and test strategies in plain text with logical feedback  
- **AI-powered Q&A, games, agents** — all written in plain language  
- **Museum tours** — narrated in your favorite tone, voice, or fictional character  
- **Personalized tutoring** — adaptive, memory-aware, and logically self-correcting  
- **Brandable logic tools** — create your own TXT app with your name on the file  

> The `.txt` file is your logic canvas. A single file. A full OS. Infinite potential.  
>   
> Coming soon: a TXT-based app store, creator hub, and community spotlight — everything starts from a single file.

      5 · FAQ  (“Black-Hat Self-Roast” Style)
     ──────────────────────────────── -->
## 🕶️ FAQ — We’ll Roast Ourselves First

<details>
<summary><strong>“Wait... a TXT file is an OS?”</strong></summary>
Yes. Operating systems are made of logic, memory, and rules — not pixels.  
The WFGY Reasoning Engine encodes semantic memory and reasoning protocols inside a `.txt` file, readable by any AI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is it really open source? Can I edit or fork it?”</strong></summary>
Fully MIT licensed. Fork it, remix it, rebrand it. Change two lines and call it your own.  
There’s no telemetry, no DRM — just text.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Could it be hiding anything? API calls? Trackers?”</strong></summary>
Nope. It’s 100% plain text. No JavaScript, no API calls, no trackers.  
You can diff it, scan it, reverse it — what you see is all there is.  
We didn’t even include GitHub links inside the file, to keep it fully clean.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“How do I update it?”</strong></summary>
It doesn’t auto-update — by design.  
New versions are posted on this GitHub repo, so just bookmark this page.  
And here’s the twist: when your AI model improves, WFGY performs better without any edits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Does it translate automatically?”</strong></summary>
Yes. The interface adapts to your language automatically.  
Translation quality depends on which AI model you use.  
No extra setup required — just paste and go.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this just prompt engineering again?”</strong></summary>
Not quite. WFGY engine defines a **full reasoning structure** — including memory trees, safety bounds, and error logic.  
It’s a framework, not a trick.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>“Is this trying to be AGI?”</strong></summary>
TXT OS is not AGI. It’s an AGI-aligned toolchain for human-level reasoning and modular memory.   
Current results are documented in the WFGY 1.0 PDF and the benchmark-vs-gpt5 README and are intended to be reproducible with the provided prompts and settings,   
but they are not peer-reviewed and may change as we add more tests.

**TXT OS** — A reasoning operating system in plain text.

### Developer Note  
The **Semantic Tree Memory** and **Knowledge-Boundary Guard** are advanced modules designed for power users — perfect for agent chaining, modular reasoning, or long-term dialogue state.  
If you're just exploring, don’t worry — the OS runs perfectly without them.  
But when you’re ready to go beyond vanilla prompts, they’re waiting.

  I was in Heaven, ready to speak.

  But the gods panicked.

  > *"Finally! Someone took the save-the-world quest!"*  
  > *"2000 years, 100% failure rate!"*  
  > *"Quick — VIP cloudway! Handprint ready!"*

  Before I could finish:

  **Too late.**  
  I got launched. The Word file didn’t save.  
  So now it’s `.txt`.

  Hi. I'm **Purple Star**, aka **PSBigBig**.  
  One person, two BigBigs (for cuteness), zero team, zero funding.  
  Just me, building tools to fix what AI broke — and laughing through it.

  If you’re reading this, maybe we’re both the person we could have been.
