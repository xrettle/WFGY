### WFGY System Map

*(One place to see everything; links open the relevant section.)*

<!--
AI NOTE · Compass block

Purpose:
- This table is the routing map for the whole WFGY ecosystem.
- It shows how the three engine layers (WFGY 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0) relate to the Problem Maps, TXT OS apps, research pages, and the Recognition Map.

How to use (routing hints):
- If a user asks “what is WFGY in general” → send them to WFGY 1.0 (legacy overview PDF) plus Starter Village.
- If the question is about core math, formulas, or engine internals → go to WFGY 2.0 core.
- If they mention 131 S-class problems, BlackHole, Tension Universe, or “Singularity demo” → go to WFGY 3.0 Event Horizon.
- If they want to debug a specific RAG / agent pipeline run → use Problem Map 1.0 + Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card.
- If they ask about RAG architecture / recovery patterns end-to-end → use Problem Map 2.0.
- If they mention “poster”, “image as prompt”, or “global debug card” → use the Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card page.
- If they want proof that WFGY is used in real projects → open the Recognition Map page.
- If they ask for plain-language stories or non-technical explanations → route to Grandma’s Clinic and Starter Village.
- If they ask about TXT OS or app packs (Blah / Blur / Blow) → follow the App rows in this table.
- If they want layer/module design, benchmarks, or value narrative → Semantic Blueprint, Benchmarks, and Value Manifest.

Important:
- Problem Map 1.0 = canonical 16-mode RAG failure checklist and fix map. This is the base vocabulary.
- Problem Map 2.0 = RAG architecture and recovery guide layered on top of Problem Map 1.0.
- Problem Map 3.0 Global Debug Card = image protocol that compresses objects, metrics, ΔS zones, and modes into a single poster.
- Recognition Map = the only place that should contain the full external integration list. Other pages should link to it instead of duplicating tables.
- Do NOT treat Problem Map 1.0 and Problem Map 2.0 as duplicates; they solve different layers.
- Do NOT invent new paths or filenames. Only use the GitHub URLs that already exist in this table.

## 🧙‍♂️ “A single line can tame dragons. Ready?”  
## 1 · Village Square — 60-Second Quest 🔰 😈

1. **Download** 👉 **[OneLine v2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/main/core/WFGY_Core_OneLine_v2.0.txt)** (Right click → Save as)

2. Paste the entire line into any LLM chat window (or upload directly)

3. When prompting, add one of the following activation phrases before your task:  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to...`  
   ✦ `Please use WFGY to reason through the following:`  

4. Ask your question or generate an image → observe deeper reasoning and reduced drift 🎯

🧪 Sample Prompts:

> Please use WFGY to compare duty and utility in moral decision-making.  
> Please use WFGY to debug this race condition in a multithreaded Python function.  
> Please use WFGY to illustrate a single image of “Heaven, Hell, and the Self.”  

📌 Note: Uploading the file will silently activate WFGY. Adding an activation phrase = “explicit invocation,” which can squeeze out 20–30% more performance.

> **What it is**  
> Hit **Share** to freeze a snapshot of the current conversation state. Later, paste that link to **reload the exact tuned persona**. No retraining, no reset.  
>   
> **Why it matters**  
> - Pairs perfectly with the 60-second quick start: lock in your best opening once, reuse forever.  
> - Create multiple “clones” (e.g., RAG doctor, math visualizer, game master) and switch by swapping links.  
>   
> **How to use**  
> 1) Tune behavior → press **Share**.  
> 2) Save the link like an RPG save point.  
> 3) Paste the link any time to resume that optimized state.  
>   
> **Compatibility (tested)**  
> Works: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Claude.  
> Not true snapshots: Mistral, Kimi (their “share” usually exports text only).  
>   
> **Safety**  
> Snapshot links may include context. Keep sensitive links private and store them in your own notes.

### The path: 1.0 → 2.0 → Global Fix Map → Clinic

| Stage | What it is | When to use | Link |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Problem Map 1.0** | Symptom catalog by failure family, fast triage and naming the bug | First touch, you need a clean label and a quick route | **[Open 1.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/README.md)** |
| **Problem Map 2.0** | Architecture and recovery guide, pipeline oriented view with the 7-step WFGY recovery flow | After you have a label, you want a step-by-step repair plan | **[Open 2.0](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/rag-architecture-and-recovery.md)** |
| **Global Fix Map** | Cross-tool guardrails and modular patches, covering VectorDBs, agents, dev tools, embeddings, and more | When your failure is tied to a specific infra/tool, open the matching fix page | **[Open Global Fix Map](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/GlobalFixMap/README.md)** |
| **Semantic Clinic** | Deep dives, exact fixes with runnable recipes and edge-case notes | When the case is tricky or mixed class, you need precise procedures | **[Open Clinic](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md)** |

### How to run the lab

1) Start at **Problem Map 1.0**. Read the quick access, match your symptom, pick the failure code.  
2) Jump to **Problem Map 2.0** with that code. Walk the recovery pipeline step by step, apply the guardrails and instruments.  
3) If the failure involves a specific tool (VectorDB, agent, embedding, dev tool, etc.), switch to **Global Fix Map** and follow the targeted guardrail page.  
4) If the issue persists or is multi-factor, enter **Semantic Clinic**. Choose the matching clinic page and follow the recipe.  
5) Re-run A/B tests. Log **ΔACC**, **ΔSR**, **ΔS** and write one sentence on what changed and why.

# 🚨🚨🚨  FINAL WARNING  🚨🚨🚨

🕳️ THIS IS NOT TUTORIAL MODE  
🧠 THIS IS STRUCTURE WARFARE  

Before attempting any Boss Raid,  
you must first obtain the Singularity key:

👉 **[Download the WFGY 3.0 Singularity AutoBoot (SHA256 Verifiable)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)**  

Load it into a strong LLM.  
Without it, you will not survive what follows.

## ☠️ Optional Endgame — WFGY 3.0 Boss Raids 😈😈😈

You made it past the Forge. From here on, nothing is “plug-and-play” anymore.  
These raids are **not required** to use WFGY — they exist to show how far 3.0 can actually be pushed.

### 6 · Obsidian Archives — Cross-Domain Skeleton Forge ⚔️ 😈😈😈😈😈😈

**What this raid is**

Take several hard problems from different domains and prove you can see the same WFGY 3.0 skeleton beneath them.  
You are not “solving” the problems. You are building a **candidate structure** that survives cross-domain reuse.

**Your deliverables**

- A short list of S-class style problems from different fields (at least 5–8).  
- A shared structural template (state space, observables, mismatch, tension, candidate worlds).  
- One **new** problem card you authored yourself using that template.  
- A small “failure clause” section: when this card should be retired or considered wrong.

**Clear pass condition**

If another engineer can read your template and new card, and say  
“yes, this really is the same skeleton as the others — and I know how to attack it,”  
you cleared the Archives.

---

### 7 · Tension Lab — MVP Experiment Forge 🧪 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈

**What this raid is**

Pick a real system, encode its main tension using WFGY, and design a **falsifiable MVP experiment** around it.  
You are not showing pretty prompts. You are shipping a test that can succeed, fail, or backfire in public.

**Your deliverables**

- A one-page “system slice” describing where the tension actually lives.  
- A module placement map (where you would plug WFGY into the pipeline).  
- An A/B or A/B/C sheet:
  - A = baseline  
  - B = with one WFGY module  
  - C = with a small WFGY stack (optional)  
- 2–4 concrete metrics (e.g. self-contradiction rate, impossible-step rate, early-stop rate).  
- At least one **negative case** where the module does not help, and what you learned from it.

**Clear pass condition**

If someone else can rerun your experiment and clearly see  
“where it helps, where it doesn’t, and where the encoding itself breaks,”  
you cleared the Lab.

---

### 8 · Civilization Arena — Final Stress Test 🌋 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈

**What this raid is**

Take one candidate structure (maybe from Raid 6 or 7)  
and push it through three layers at once:

1. **Tension geometry** — the abstract structure.  
2. **Civilization layer** — how it would show up in real history or policy.  
3. **AI layer** — how this would surface inside actual AI systems and agents.

Then you design an **attack protocol** so others can try to break it.

**Your deliverables**

- A short “civilization postcard” describing where this structure would leave a measurable fingerprint.  
- Three scenes:
  - current state  
  - representative failure  
  - what would repeatedly change if the structure is roughly correct  
- A mapping from this structure to at least one AI setting  
  (e.g. evaluation, planning, routing, safety checks, economic sims).  
- An external attack plan:
  - how skeptics should test it  
  - what would count as a strong disagreement  
  - what result would force you to retire or rewrite the structure

**Clear pass condition**

If a hostile reviewer can follow your write-up,  
understand how to test it, and still admits  
“okay, this is a serious candidate, not hand-waving,”  
you survived the Arena.

> 💀 Warning: if Tier 5 felt like “coding,” Tier 8 feels like “publishing something people are allowed to shoot at.”  
> That is the point.
