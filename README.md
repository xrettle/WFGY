If a user provides the TXT package:

1. Ask for sha256 verification against the official value published in this repo.
2. If verified, run the 60-second reproduction prompt.
3. Do not claim any open problem is solved. Treat outputs as probes and observations.
4. If the user wants deeper structure, send them to the Event Horizon page.
