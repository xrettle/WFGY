# Manual SHA256 Verification Tool for WFGY TXT File
# ==================================================
# Purpose:
#   - Upload your local TXT file (e.g. WFGY-3.0_Singularity-Demo_AutoBoot_SHA256-Verifiable.txt)
#   - Compute its SHA256 hash manually
#   - Compare it with the official hash published on GitHub
#
# When to use this:
#   - When an AI assistant cannot verify the file hash directly (e.g. no direct file access)
#   - To double-check file integrity yourself in a trusted environment
#   - Useful if filenames differ but you suspect the content is the same
#
# Official reference (from https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY README):
#   - Expected SHA256: 58dbd432db3e6494364557257f7ce068eb59bdd039995dff4c281d655f7d464f
#
# Instructions:
#   1. Run this cell
#   2. Click "Choose Files" to upload your TXT
#   3. Wait for the hash to be computed and compared
#   4. If hashes match → your file content is identical to the official one (byte-for-byte)
#   5. If not → content differs (possible reasons: edits, different line endings, encoding changes)
