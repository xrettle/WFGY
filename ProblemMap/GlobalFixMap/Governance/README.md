A hub for governance controls around AI pipelines.  
Use this folder when failures are not infra or retrieval bugs, but breakdowns in policy, approvals, lineage, or compliance.  
Every page links to a structural WFGY fix and carries measurable acceptance targets so you can verify governance gates quickly.

---

## When to use this folder

- Policies exist but are unclear, obsolete, or unenforced
- Prompts or models change without sign-off and audit trail
- Data provenance is lost between documents, chunks, embeddings, and answers
- PII handling, minimization, or redaction cannot be proven
- License or usage rights are ambiguous for datasets or generated outputs
- Incident response or postmortems are missing or not actionable

---

## Acceptance targets

- Policy coverage ≥ 0.95 across datasets, prompts, models, eval
- ΔS(question, retrieved) ≤ 0.45 for governed outputs
- Coverage of the target section ≥ 0.70 with cite-then-explain
- λ remains convergent across 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds
- Every waiver has owner, expiry, and review link
- Immutable audit logs are joinable to lineage and approvals

## Governance in 60 seconds

1. **Gate before ship**  
   Require cite-then-explain, ΔS ≤ 0.45, coverage ≥ 0.70 on 3 paraphrases and 2 seeds.
2. **Lock the policy surface**  
   For each change, capture who, what, why, and link to risk entry. Block if approvals missing.
3. **Prove lineage**  
   Emit a joinable record for question, snippets, ΔS, λ state, policy checks, model rev.
4. **Escalate with a plan**  
   If any gate fails, open the page from the table above and attach a time-boxed fix.

## FAQ

**Q1. We already have security reviews. Why add governance here as well**
Security reviews focus on systems and data access. Governance closes the policy loop for prompts, models, eval, and end user impact. It gives repeatable gates for ΔS, coverage, and approvals so releases are auditable.

**Q2. What is the fastest path to “good enough” governance for a small team**
Start with three items. Change control for prompts and models. Eval gate with cite-then-explain and ΔS and coverage targets. A minimal lineage log that joins questions, snippets, and approvals.

**Q3. How do I prove PII minimization without slowing teams down**
Tag sensitivity at ingest, redact at export, and enforce a schema that carries policy flags with each snippet. Keep a joinable audit log. See PII handling and the audit pages.

**Q4. Our legal team asks who owns the generated outputs. What should we track**
Record the base model license, any fine-tune datasets with rights, and the allowed uses. Store the link to the release note and model card for each production rev.

**Q5. We passed eval but a week later users saw regressions**
Your gate is not attached to change control. Hook the same eval and targets to the approval workflow and block deploys if the gate fails.

**Q6. What is a practical rule for waivers**
Every waiver must have an owner, an expiry, a review link, and a rollback. Put it in a risk register and report open waivers weekly.

**Q7. People ask for explainability but do not read long reports**
Provide a short model card and keep the citation trail visible. For complex cases include one visual lineage join to show where an answer came from.

**Q8. Which metrics should appear on an executive dashboard**
Policy coverage, count of approved changes, open waivers by age, ΔS and coverage medians, incident count and mean time to resolution, and percentage of runs with cite-then-explain.

**Q9. How do we align with new regulations without rewriting everything**
Keep your policy baseline and evidence mapping separate from code. Store proofs in an immutable sink and link them to releases. Update the mappings as new rules arrive.

**Q10. What triggers an escalation**
Any failed gate, waiver beyond expiry, missing lineage, or production PII event. Follow the escalation page and attach a dated recovery plan.
