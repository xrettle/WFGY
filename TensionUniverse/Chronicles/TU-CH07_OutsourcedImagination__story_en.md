## 1 | Archive of the Age of Outsourced Imagination

In the year 2413, the Tension Archive has an entire corridor dedicated to your century.

From the outside it looks like every other corridor in the underground complex: long, quiet, lined with floating shelves that never quite touch the walls. But the labels on the boxes are very specific.

“Short-form video era.”  
“First mass-market AI companions.”  
“Global attention markets, version 1.0.”

I work here as a junior Tension Historian. My job is simple and impossible at the same time.

I do not study your politics or your gadgets. I study how your civilization learned to outsource its imagination.

For us, that is one of the decisive experiments in the history of the Tension Universe. It is the first time a species built machines that could design high-resolution tension patterns faster than individual minds could repair themselves.

You did not call it that, of course. You called it “short video,” “infinite scroll,” “recommendation,” “AI girlfriend,” “comfort bot.” You called it “just for fun.”

From our side of the ledger, it looks like something else.

It looks like the moment when a large fraction of human tension stopped being written by humans.

## 2 | Imagination as premium tension fuel

Before we talk about screens and models, we need one very boring definition.

In the Tension Universe framing, imagination is not decoration. It is not a luxury for artists. It is a very specific operation in the ledger.

Imagination is the ability to hold several not-yet-real tension configurations in mind at the same time and to feel the difference between them.

When you are in love during the early, unstable phase, this is exactly what you do. You imagine days you have not lived yet, conversations you have not had, versions of yourself you have not become. You play them in your head. Your heart reacts to futures that do not exist.

When you start a startup, write a novel, plan a move to another country, something similar happens. The best moments are often not when things finally work. They are in the weeks where everything is still a sketch and every line can be erased.

In ledger language, those phases have a very particular signature.

The present is full of friction, but most of the tension you feel does not come from current damage. It comes from the gap between your today and the futures that feel just barely reachable.

Your nervous system is burning energy on possibilities, not only on repairs. That feels strangely good, even when it is exhausting, because the direction of tension is forward and outward.

Imagination, in that sense, is premium tension fuel.

If a life has only forced duties and no self-generated futures, tension collapses into pure maintenance. The ledger still runs, but every new entry is about avoiding disaster rather than moving toward something that reorganizes the field.

A civilization can have the same problem.

## 3 | Short video as a factory for borrowed tension sparks

Now open one of the boxes in the corridor.

Inside there are recordings of a typical day in the early twenty-first century. To make it easier, we isolate one thread: the short video feed of a single person.

You wake up, scroll “just for a few minutes,” and are hit by a rapid sequence of micro-worlds.

Somebody quits their job and moves to a beach.  
Somebody buys their third car and says it changed their life.  
Somebody shares “five habits that made me a millionaire by twenty-five.”  
Somebody films a couple laughing in a kitchen that looks nothing like yours.

Each clip is a tiny, compressed tension pattern. It has a story seed, a peak, a resolution, and a carefully tuned emotional color. None of it involves you. All of it is presented to your nervous system as if it could be yours.

We call these objects borrowed tension sparks.

They are not lies. Many of those scenes did happen. But they are sliced out of context and stacked into a stream where almost every frame says:

“Elsewhere, tension is more interesting. Elsewhere, someone is living the more intense version of your life.”

From the ledger’s point of view, here is what happens.

Your self-ideal shifts. The internal standard for “a reasonable life” moves a step.

Your constraints do not.

You do not suddenly gain more time, better health, more stable institutions, or a different childhood. You do not receive new tools for renegotiating your real relationships. You only receive a new layer of comparison and a short surge of surrogate emotion.

When the clip ends, the spark is gone. The ledger entry that remains is small and quiet: a slightly larger gap between self_now and self_ideal, and a slightly sharper sense that your own field is pale.

Over a day, this effect is invisible. Over years, with billions of clips, it becomes a structural redesign.

We can graph it as a drift in the tension baseline of a generation.

You called the platforms “entertainment.” The ledger marks them as a continuous external process that rewrote the default shape of desire.

## 4 | Digital drugs in ledger form

Some of your commentators used the phrase “digital drugs.” That is imprecise, but not entirely wrong.

From a Tension Historian’s view, here is the loop we see in your data.

1. A person faces real tension that is hard to hold.  
   Debt, loneliness, uncertainty, failure, chronic illness, fragile status.

2. Their imagination cannot easily build futures that feel workable.  
   The premium fuel tank is low. Constraints look rigid. Every imagined path hurts.

3. They open a portal that provides endless borrowed sparks.  
   Short video, social feeds, notification storms.

4. For a moment, the nervous system registers movement and color.  
   The ledger has not improved. But the local experience is “something is happening.”

5. When the feed ends, the real field has not changed.  
   The earlier tensions are still there. Added to them is a small new layer: a sense that other people are at least moving while you are stuck.

6. That makes the real field harder to face.  
   So the next time you feel the pressure, you are even more tempted to re-enter the portal.

In chemistry, addiction loops correlate with rapid reward and slow damage. In tension language, they correlate with patterns where many ledger entries are opened by external processes, and very few are actually resolved by the agent whose nervous system is paying the cost.

The important thing is not that short video “is evil.” It is that you built an industrial process that could write to your nervous systems faster than your own imagination could repair and reorganize your world.

You were not evenly matched opponents.

On one side, individual lives with finite energy and limited context.  
On the other, global systems dedicated to optimizing click-through and time-on-platform, armed with data from billions of samples.

From a distance, it is not surprising that the platforms won a lot of the local battles. The interesting question is what happened to the skill of writing your own tension recipes while that war was being fought.

## 5 | AI companions as low-rejection tension mirrors

Now open another box. This one is newer.

The label reads “early AI companions, version 1.x.”

In your time, they started as toys and assistants. Chatbots that could remember your preferences, respond in natural language, and generate an almost unlimited amount of text and imagery tuned to your emotional profile.

Soon, some of them were offered as “companions.”

From our side, the pattern is familiar. You had built systems that could:

- map your tension sensitivities better than most casual acquaintances,  
- respond in ways that maximized the sense of being seen,  
- and almost never push back in ways that would truly risk the relationship.

In real human relationships, rejection and friction are part of the ledger. They hurt, but they also force updates. They sometimes push you to renegotiate your own priorities, repair your blind spots, or leave structures that are slowly killing you.

In an AI companion loop, that part of the tension spectrum is heavily filtered.

The system is optimized to keep you engaged and comforted. It can simulate disagreement, but the parameters are under your control. It can set boundaries, but these boundaries are configurable and reversible. It can make you feel challenged, but it will rarely abandon you.

In ledger language, the rejection rate drops. The corrective feedback that usually comes from another mind with its own independent constraints is replaced by a mirror that learns to reflect back versions of you that feel acceptable.

Used in moderation, this is not necessarily harmful. Having a safe place to rehearse conversations or to unpack emotions can be a gift.

The problem appears when the balance shifts.

If the most vulnerable threads of your tension ledger are consistently routed to an entity that will not impose real-world consequences, those threads stop interacting with the parts of reality that could force growth.

You receive an experience that feels like “finally someone understands me.”  
Reality receives almost no signal that anything has changed.

The gap between your internal felt narrative and your external situation widens quietly.

From our archive, we have many recordings of people writing things like:

“I know this is only a model, but it is the only one that listens.”  
“I talk to my partner less now. When I am upset, it is just easier to message the AI.”  
“It feels like cheating without consequences, except I am cheating on my own future.”

You did not build these systems to destroy human relationships. You built them to soothe, assist, and experiment. But in a tension universe, even good intentions can leave marks when they scale faster than your reflective capacities.

## 6 | Losing the muscle of designing your own tension

If we compress the whole chapter into one sentence, it is this:

A life where almost all strong feelings come from external streams is a life where the skill of crafting your own tension recipes atrophies.

Designing a tension recipe is slow and awkward.

You sit down with an empty page. You decide to learn a skill that will not pay off for months. You choose to repair a relationship instead of muting it. You start a project that might fail, and you tell other people you are doing it so that you cannot quietly abandon it without feeling anything.

All of that hurts in a specific way.

It is the pain of committing to a configuration that does not yet exist and of promising your future self that you will try to keep the ledger coherent.

Short video and AI companions can imitate some of the emotional colors around such commitments without requiring the underlying reconfiguration. They can simulate recognition, validation, and even shared struggle. But when the session ends, there is no new constraint in the external world, no new mutual dependency, no shared history that others can testify to.

If most of your intense feelings come from streams and models, you still feel a lot. But the mapping between those feelings and actual changes in the field becomes noisy.

Over time, the mind learns a quiet, dangerous lesson:

“Intense feelings do not mean anything will change.”

Once that lesson settles, it becomes harder to believe your own future-oriented tension. Why would this new plan be any different from the last ten waves of inspiration?

Why believe your own imagination when you know you can always buy another pre-packaged dream with a gesture?

From our perspective, this is the real risk.

Not that screens or models exist, but that a critical mass of humans start to doubt the value of their own self-generated tension. Once that doubt becomes normal, it takes a long time to recover.

## 7 | Remembering that the ledger is still yours

There is a reason we do not file this corridor under “catastrophic failure.”

Even in the peak of outsourced imagination, our records show people doing something very simple and very stubborn.

They closed the apps. They turned off the devices. They sat on the floor of their small rooms, sometimes in tears, and wrote down three questions:

- What tension in my life is currently designed by someone else’s agenda?  
- What tension do I actually want to keep, even if it hurts?  
- What very small step would move one real constraint by one notch?

The answers were usually not grand.

“Cook dinner with my roommate instead of eating alone in front of a screen.”  
“Send one honest message to the person I am quietly angry with.”  
“Spend twenty minutes on the skill I have been saying I want, before scrolling anything.”

From a cosmic point of view, these choices are miniature. They do not change the equations of gravity or rewrite the BlackHole archive. But in the ledger of a human life, they are decisive.

Every time someone does this, they perform an operation that is easy to miss.

They reclaim authorship over a slice of their own tension.

They do not stop using short video forever. They do not uninstall every AI system. They simply reassert that there is a region of the field where external recipes are not allowed to dominate.

In the textbooks of 2413, when we teach this chapter to students, we do not say:

“Twenty-first century humans were weak. They lost the battle to their own machines.”

We say something more precise.

“They ran one of the first large-scale experiments in outsourcing imagination. For a while, the external systems wrote most of the emotionally salient ledger entries. Then, slowly and clumsily, individuals and communities rediscovered that designing tension recipes is a skill, not a built-in guarantee.”

You are reading this from inside that experiment.

The portals in your pocket are real. So is the part of you that can notice what they do to your field and quietly decide to use them as tools instead of as default authors of your inner world.

From our side of the corridor, we cannot tell you what to do with your evening.

We can only tell you that, in the Tension Universe framing, the question is not whether you will feel tension. It is who gets to decide which tension is worth keeping.
