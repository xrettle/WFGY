## 0. Effective layer disclaimer

All statements in this entry are made strictly at the **effective layer** of the Tension Universe (TU) framework, for the encoding class:

```txt
encoding_class_BH_MATH_ODDPERF_E1_v1
```

In particular:

* This file only specifies:

  * a problem specific state space `M_009`,
  * observables, mismatch terms and tension scores,
  * counterfactual worlds and experiment templates,
  * and engineering roles for AI systems inside WFGY / TU.

* It does **not** define or modify any TU level axiom system, generative rule, or background measure.

* It does **not** provide any constructive mapping from raw arithmetic data into internal TU fields. All such mappings are treated as implementation choices outside the scope of this document.

* It does **not** claim to prove or disprove the canonical odd perfect number problem stated in Section 1, and it does not introduce any new theorem in number theory.

Any reference to “World T” or “World F” later in this file is a **counterfactual effective layer narrative only**. No field, label, parameter, or index defined here is allowed to silently encode the canonical truth value of Q009.

## 1. Canonical problem and status

### 1.1 Canonical statement

For a positive integer `n`, let `sigma(n)` denote the sum of all positive divisors of `n`.

An integer `n` is called perfect if

```txt
sigma(n) = 2 * n .
```

Equivalently, the sum of all positive divisors of `n` equals twice `n`.

Classically:

* There are infinitely many **even** perfect numbers if and only if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.
* All known perfect numbers are even and have the form

  ```txt
  n = 2^(p - 1) * (2^p - 1)
  ```

  where `2^p - 1` is prime.

The **odd perfect number problem** asks:

> Does there exist any odd integer `n` such that `sigma(n) = 2 * n`?

Equivalently:

* Are there any **odd perfect numbers**, or are all perfect numbers necessarily even?

### 1.2 Status and difficulty

The problem remains open. No odd perfect number is known, and no proof of impossibility is known.

Partial results include:

* If an odd perfect number exists, it must be extremely large (far beyond current computational bounds).

* It must have a very constrained prime factorization, for example:

  * it must be divisible by at least one prime raised to a high power,
  * it must satisfy tight relationships between its prime factors and exponents,
  * the structure of `sigma(n)` must match these prime factorization constraints in very specific ways.

* Many necessary conditions have been derived, including:

  * lower bounds on the number of distinct prime factors,
  * congruence conditions on prime factors,
  * restrictions on the exponents of primes in the factorization.

Despite significant progress on these necessary conditions and large computational searches, the existence question remains unresolved. It is considered one of the central unsolved problems of multiplicative number theory.

### 1.3 Role in the BlackHole project

Within the BlackHole S-problem collection, Q009 plays several roles:

1. It is a canonical example of a **consistency_tension** problem in discrete multiplicative number theory, where many local constraints must jointly fit a global equality `sigma(n) = 2 * n`.

2. It provides a test bed for Tension Universe encodings of:

   * discrete state spaces of factorization data,
   * divisor sum observables,
   * consistency based tension functionals.

3. It generates reusable components for other problems where:

   * strong necessary conditions are known,
   * no examples are known,
   * and the main issue is whether the constraint system can be jointly satisfied at all.

## 2. Position in the BlackHole graph

This block records how Q009 sits inside the BlackHole graph. Each edge is listed with a one line reason pointing to a concrete component or tension concept.

### 2.1 Upstream problems

These provide prerequisites, tools, or general frameworks that Q009 relies on at the effective layer.

* Q001 (BH_MATH_NUM_L3_001 · Riemann Hypothesis)
  Reason: supplies the general perspective on multiplicative number theory and Dirichlet series that underlies the divisor sum observable and its analytic interpretations, reused in the `DivisorProfileDescriptor` component.

* Q005 (BH_MATH_ABC_CONJ_L3_005 · abc conjecture)
  Reason: provides a general framework for tension between additive and multiplicative structure for integers, reused conceptually in the consistency constraints of `OddPerfectTensionFunctional`.

* Q019 (BH_MATH_DIOPH_DENSITY_L3_019 · Diophantine density problems)
  Reason: provides tools for thinking about how sparse certain special sets of integers can be, which informs the way Q009 treats the possible “density zero” nature of odd perfect numbers within the `ConstraintSaturationWorld_OPN` pattern.

### 2.2 Downstream problems

These problems directly reuse components of Q009.

* Q020 (BH_MATH_MULT_FUNC_STRUCT_L3_020 · structure of multiplicative functions)
  Reason: reuses `DivisorProfileDescriptor` to study more general multiplicative functions and their divisor like behavior.

* Q021 (BH_MATH_EXTREME_DIVISOR_L3_021 · extreme values of divisor sums)
  Reason: reuses `OddPerfectTensionFunctional` as a special case of extreme divisor sum consistency tension.

* Q023 (BH_MATH_SPARSE_SPECIAL_SET_L3_023 · sparsity of special integer sets)
  Reason: uses `ConstraintSaturationWorld_OPN` as a template for building worlds where special integer classes are either empty or extremely sparse.

### 2.3 Parallel problems

Parallel nodes share similar tension types but no direct component reuse.

* Q007 (BH_MATH_TWINPRIME_L3_007 · twin primes)
  Reason: both Q007 and Q009 study extremely constrained integer patterns where many local conditions might forbid global existence, under a consistency_tension view.

* Q006 (BH_MATH_GOLDBACH_L3_006 · Goldbach type problems)
  Reason: both problems sit in the space of “combinatorially plausible, globally unproven” structures where known constraints and current data are in tension but do not yet resolve the question.

### 2.4 Cross domain edges

Cross domain edges connect Q009 to problems in other domains that can reuse its components.

* Q059 (BH_CS_INFO_THERMODYN_L3_059 · information thermodynamics)
  Reason: can reuse the idea of `ConstraintSaturationWorld_OPN` to model how extreme configurations in discrete state spaces may or may not be realized in physical or informational systems.

* Q123 (BH_AI_INTERP_L3_123 · AI interpretability via discrete structures)
  Reason: reuses `DivisorProfileDescriptor` as an analogy for describing structured discrete features inside AI models (for example, factorization like patterns in neuron activations).

## 3. Tension Universe encoding (effective layer)

All content in this block stays at the effective layer. We only describe:

* discrete state spaces,
* observables and fields,
* invariants and tension scores,
* singular sets and domain restrictions.

We do **not** describe any hidden generative rules or any mapping from raw computational data to internal TU fields.

### 3.1 State space

We assume a discrete semantic state space

```txt
M_009
```

with the following effective interpretation:

* Each `m` in `M_009` is a finite **odd integer configuration** up to a search horizon `H(m)` in the positive integers.

* For each regular state `m` (see §3.6) and each **odd** integer `n` with

```txt
1 < n <= H(m),  n odd,
```

the configuration includes:

* the prime factorization of `n`,
* the value `sigma(n)`,
* the normalized distance to perfection
  (defined precisely in §3.2),
* metadata describing which known necessary conditions for odd perfect numbers have been checked for `n` and whether each is satisfied.

We do not specify how factorizations or `sigma(n)` values are computed or stored. We only require that:

* For any finite search bound `B`, there exist states `m` in `M_009` with `H(m) = B` whose content reflects **all** odd `n` with `1 < n <= B` together with consistent divisor sum and factorization summaries.

Such states are the ones used in horizon based experiments. States that omit odd integers below their own `H(m)` are treated as singular and excluded from tension analysis.

### 3.2 Effective fields and observables

On `M_009` we define the following discrete observables. All mismatch terms are treated as **dimensionless** quantities, up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified at the TU charter level.

#### 3.2.1 Normalized distance to perfect

For each odd integer `n` in `content(m)`, define

```txt
dist_OPN(n) = | sigma(n) - 2 * n | / (2 * n)  >= 0 .
```

This is a symmetric, dimensionless measure of how far `n` is from being perfect:

* `dist_OPN(n) = 0` if and only if `n` is perfect,
* both “deficient” (`sigma(n) < 2n`) and “abundant` (`sigma(n) > 2n`) odd integers contribute strictly positive distance.

For a state `m` in `M_009`, define the minimal normalized distance

```txt
Delta_sigma_min(m) = min { dist_OPN(n) : n odd, 1 < n <= H(m) } .
```

Since each configuration is finite and we only consider regular states with complete coverage of odd integers up to `H(m)`, this minimum is well defined.

#### 3.2.2 Structural constraint library

We assume a finite library of necessary conditions for odd perfect numbers:

```txt
L_OPN = { C_1, C_2, ..., C_K } ,  with K >= 1 .
```

Each `C_k` is a condition that can be evaluated on any odd integer `n` using only its factorization and basic arithmetic data, and returns a boolean value:

```txt
C_k(n) in {true, false} .
```

The intended semantics is: if an odd perfect number exists, every such number must satisfy **all** conditions in `L_OPN`. The library is fixed at the charter level and does **not** depend on search data seen in any particular state.

For each odd `n`, define

```txt
sat_count(n) = number of k in {1,...,K} with C_k(n) = true .
```

and

```txt
sat_frac(n) = sat_count(n) / K      in [0, 1] .
```

#### 3.2.3 Structural gap observable

For each state `m` in `M_009`, define the structural compatibility observable

```txt
f_struct(m) = max { sat_frac(n) : n odd, 1 < n <= H(m) } .
```

This is the best fraction of constraints simultaneously satisfied by any odd `n` in the explored range.

We then define the structural gap

```txt
Delta_struct(m) = 1 - f_struct(m)  in [0, 1] .
```

Interpretation:

* `Delta_struct(m) = 0` if some odd `n` in the configuration satisfies **all** constraints in `L_OPN`.
* Larger values of `Delta_struct(m)` indicate that even the best candidates in the explored range fail to satisfy many necessary conditions.

This choice makes the structural term a dimensionless, bounded quantity that is directly comparable across different horizons.

### 3.3 Combined odd perfect mismatch

We define a combined mismatch observable

```txt
DeltaS_OPN(m) = w_sigma * Delta_sigma_min(m)
                + w_struct * Delta_struct(m) ,
```

where:

* `w_sigma > 0` and `w_struct > 0`,
* `w_sigma + w_struct = 1`,
* the pair `(w_sigma, w_struct)` is chosen from a **finite admissible set**

```txt
W_OPN = { (w_sigma^(1), w_struct^(1)), ...,
          (w_sigma^(L), w_struct^(L)) } ,
```

fixed at the TU charter level.

Once an encoding instance of Q009 is instantiated for experiments, a single pair `(w_sigma, w_struct)` from `W_OPN` is selected and **frozen**. Using a different pair corresponds to a different encoding instance and must be versioned separately.

By construction:

* `Delta_sigma_min(m) >= 0`,
* `Delta_struct(m) in [0, 1]`,
* `DeltaS_OPN(m) >= 0` for all regular states `m`.

The combined mismatch is dimensionless and lives on a fixed scale determined by the TU Tension Scale Charter.

### 3.4 Effective tension tensor components

Consistent with TU core conventions, we define a semantic tension tensor component

```txt
T_ij(m) = S_i(m) * C_j(m) * DeltaS_OPN(m) * lambda(m) * kappa_OPN
```

where:

* `S_i(m)` is a source like factor describing the influence of the ith structural component (for example, contribution from divisor sums versus factorization patterns).
* `C_j(m)` is a receptivity like factor describing how sensitive the jth downstream object is to violations of odd perfect consistency.
* `DeltaS_OPN(m)` is the combined mismatch defined above.
* `lambda(m)` is a convergence state factor from the TU core, taking values in a fixed bounded interval that encodes whether local reasoning around `m` is stable or unstable.
* `kappa_OPN` is a fixed coupling constant that sets the overall scale of odd perfect number tension in this encoding.

We do not specify the detailed index sets for `i` and `j`. It is enough that for each regular `m` in the regular domain (defined in §3.6), `T_ij(m)` is well defined and finite.

### 3.5 Invariants and effective constraints

We introduce simple invariants that summarize the state of the search.

1. Search horizon invariant

```txt
I_horizon(m) = H(m) ,
```

interpreted as the maximum odd integer for which the configuration `m` includes divisor and factorization data.

For regular states used in horizon based experiments we require:

```txt
content(m) = { n : 1 < n <= H(m), n odd } .
```

In particular, no odd integers below `H(m)` are omitted.

2. Minimal distance invariant

```txt
I_min_dist(m) = Delta_sigma_min(m) .
```

This captures how close the current explored range has come to satisfying `sigma(n) = 2 * n` for an odd `n`, in normalized distance.

3. Structural gap invariant

```txt
I_struct_gap(m) = Delta_struct(m) .
```

This measures how jointly satisfiable the known necessary conditions appear within the explored range, taking the best candidate.

In worlds where odd perfect numbers exist and are not astronomically sparse, one expects that for suitable sequences of states `m_k` with increasing horizons `H(m_k)`, the pair

```txt
(I_min_dist(m_k), I_struct_gap(m_k))
```

can occasionally become small, driving `DeltaS_OPN(m_k)` into a low band. In worlds where no odd perfect numbers exist, one expects persistent lower bounds on at least one of these invariants.

### 3.6 Singular set and domain restrictions

Some configurations might be incomplete or inconsistent. Examples include:

* missing factorization or divisor sums for some odd `n` with `1 < n <= H(m)`,
* contradictory annotation about whether a constraint `C_k` holds for a given `n`,
* undefined or non finite values for `Delta_sigma_min(m)` or `Delta_struct(m)`.

We define the singular set:

```txt
S_sing_009 = { m in M_009 :
               Delta_sigma_min(m) is undefined or not finite
               or Delta_struct(m) is undefined or not finite
               or content(m) omits some odd n with 1 < n <= H(m) } .
```

All Q009 tension analysis is restricted to the regular domain

```txt
M_009_reg = M_009 \ S_sing_009 .
```

Whenever an experiment would require evaluating `DeltaS_OPN(m)` for `m` in `S_sing_009`, that case is treated as **out of domain** and does not count as evidence about the truth of the odd perfect number problem itself.

---

## 4. Tension principle for this problem

This block states how Q009 is characterized as a tension problem within TU at the effective layer.

### 4.1 Core tension functional

At the effective layer we define an odd perfect tension functional:

```txt
Tension_OPN(m) = DeltaS_OPN(m)
               = w_sigma * Delta_sigma_min(m)
                 + w_struct * Delta_struct(m) ,
```

with `(w_sigma, w_struct)` taken from the fixed finite admissible set `W_OPN` (see §3.3). No other combining function is allowed in this problem file.

The functional satisfies:

* `Tension_OPN(m) >= 0` for all `m` in `M_009_reg`,
* `Tension_OPN(m)` is small when both the minimal normalized distance and structural gap are small,
* `Tension_OPN(m)` is large when either the normalized distance stays large or many structural conditions are jointly violated.

### 4.2 Odd perfect numbers as a low tension principle

At the effective layer, the “odd perfect numbers exist” scenario can be rephrased as:

> There exist sequences of regular states `m_k` in `M_009_reg` with strictly increasing horizons
>
> ```txt
> H(m_1) < H(m_2) < ...,
> ```
>
> such that the tension values `Tension_OPN(m_k)` enter and remain, along a subsequence, in a narrow low band.

More concretely, in a world where odd perfect numbers exist:

* For some encoding instance and some sequence of regular states with horizons tending to infinity, the statistics of odd integers up to `H(m_k)` are such that:

  * at some horizons, there are odd `n` with very small `dist_OPN(n)`,
  * at some horizons, there are odd `n` that satisfy most or all constraints in `L_OPN`,
  * along a subsequence of horizons, both effects co occur often enough that

    ```txt
    Tension_OPN(m_k) <= epsilon_OPN
    ```

    for some small, pre chosen threshold `epsilon_OPN` that does not depend on the particular search data.

The tension principle does not assert that such a sequence exists; it only describes what low tension behavior would look like if odd perfect numbers were realized and not prohibitively sparse.

### 4.3 Nonexistence as persistent high tension

By contrast, the “no odd perfect numbers exist” scenario can be expressed as:

> For any admissible encoding instance and any sequence of regular states `m_k` in `M_009_reg` with horizons tending to infinity, there exists a positive lower bound `delta_OPN` such that `Tension_OPN(m_k)` cannot be made arbitrarily small.

Informally, in a world where odd perfect numbers do not exist:

* minimal normalized distances for odd `n` never approach zero in a stable way,
* structural constraints cannot be jointly satisfied even as the search horizon grows,
* the combined tension functional stays bounded away from zero, at least along large horizon states that faithfully encode the actual integers.

The tension principle does not prove either scenario. It only provides a structured way to talk about how discrete search data and theoretical constraints would look in the two worlds.

---

## 5. Counterfactual tension worlds

We describe two counterfactual worlds at the effective layer:

* World T: odd perfect numbers exist.
* World F: no odd perfect number exists.

We describe how observables behave in each world, not how any internal TU fields are generated.

### 5.1 World T (odd perfect numbers exist, low consistency tension)

In World T:

1. Existence of candidates

   * There exist infinitely many horizons `H_k` and associated regular states `m_T_k` in `M_009_reg` such that:

     ```txt
     content(m_T_k) includes at least one odd n
     with sigma(n) = 2 * n .
     ```

   * For such states, `Delta_sigma_min(m_T_k) = 0`.

2. Structural compatibility

   * For many of the horizons where candidates appear, the constraint library `L_OPN` has instances that are exactly or nearly satisfied by those candidates, so that `Delta_struct(m_T_k)` is small, possibly zero.

3. Global tension pattern

   * For appropriate sequences of states, the tension functional satisfies:

     ```txt
     Tension_OPN(m_T_k) <= epsilon_OPN
     ```

     where `epsilon_OPN` is a small threshold determined by the encoding and expected numerical noise, fixed in advance and not tuned to specific search runs.

4. Horizon monotonicity

   * The sequence of horizons is strictly increasing, and the construction of `m_T_k` from search data follows a fixed protocol that does not depend on the observed values of `Tension_OPN(m_T_k)`.

### 5.2 World F (no odd perfect numbers, persistent high consistency tension)

In World F:

1. No exact solutions

   * In every regular state `m_F` in `M_009_reg`, and for every odd `n` in `content(m_F)`:

     ```txt
     sigma(n) != 2 * n ,
     ```

     hence `dist_OPN(n) > 0` for all such `n` and therefore `Delta_sigma_min(m_F) > 0`.

2. Structural obstruction

   * For many horizons, the structural constraints in `L_OPN` cannot be nearly jointly satisfied by any odd `n` in the explored range, so that `Delta_struct(m_F)` does not drift toward zero as the horizon increases.

3. Global tension pattern

   * For regular states reflecting large horizons, there exists a strictly positive `delta_OPN` such that:

     ```txt
     Tension_OPN(m_F) >= delta_OPN
     ```

     for all sufficiently large horizons consistent with the encoding protocol.

4. Robustness under admissible changes

   * Small admissible changes to the weight pair `(w_sigma, w_struct)` within the predetermined finite set `W_OPN` do not turn a persistently high tension pattern into an artificial low tension pattern without a clear mathematical explanation.

### 5.3 Interpretive note

The two worlds are not constructed inside TU. They are only described in terms of how:

* minimal normalized distances,
* structural gap indices,
* and tension functionals

would behave if we had faithful large scale configurations in each scenario.

TU encodings are judged by whether they provide stable, interpretable summaries of these patterns, not by whether they decide the canonical problem.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and discriminating experiments

This block describes experiments and protocols that can:

* test the coherence of the Q009 encoding,
* distinguish between different odd perfect tension encodings,
* provide evidence for or against particular parameter choices within the admissible set.

They do **not** prove or disprove the existence of odd perfect numbers. They only test the chosen TU encoding.

### Experiment 1: Search horizon tension profile

**Goal**
Test whether the `Tension_OPN` functional provides a stable and interpretable summary of existing computational searches for odd perfect numbers.

**Setup**

* Input data: published tables of odd integers checked up to a search bound `B`, together with `sigma(n)` and factorization data for each odd `n`.

* Choose a strictly increasing sequence of bounds

  ```txt
  B_1 < B_2 < ... < B_K ,
  ```

  fixed in advance (for example, based on published search milestones).

* For each bound `B_k`, define a regular state `m_Bk` in `M_009_reg` that:

  * has `H(m_Bk) = B_k`,
  * encodes **all** odd `n` with `1 < n <= B_k`,
  * includes `dist_OPN(n)` and the truth values of all `C_j(n)` for `j = 1,...,K`.

**Protocol**

1. Fix a weight pair `(w_sigma, w_struct)` from `W_OPN` before examining the data.

2. For each `k`, compute:

   ```txt
   Delta_sigma_min(m_Bk)
   Delta_struct(m_Bk)
   Tension_OPN(m_Bk)
   ```

3. Plot or tabulate `Tension_OPN(m_Bk)` as a function of `B_k`.

4. Optionally repeat for other weight pairs in `W_OPN`, treated as separate, versioned encodings.

**Metrics**

* Trend of `Delta_sigma_min(m_Bk)` with respect to `B_k`.
* Trend of `Delta_struct(m_Bk)` with respect to `B_k`.
* Trend and variability of `Tension_OPN(m_Bk)` as `B_k` grows.
* Qualitative stability of these trends across different admissible weight pairs.

**Falsification conditions**

* If small admissible changes in `(w_sigma, w_struct)` lead to wildly different and mathematically unmotivated tension trends, the current encoding of `Tension_OPN` is considered unstable and rejected.
* If known search data suggest that minimal distances and structural gaps behave in one qualitative way, but **every** admissible weight choice produces an opposite or incoherent pattern, then the encoding is considered misaligned and rejected.

**Semantics implementation note**
All quantities are treated as discrete and dimensionless, consistent with the effective layer semantics. No continuous interpolation or gradient structure is assumed in this experiment.

**Boundary note**
Falsifying a TU encoding is **not** the same as solving the canonical statement. This experiment can reject specific tension encodings, but it does not prove or disprove the existence of odd perfect numbers.

---

### Experiment 2: Model world comparison with synthetic multiplicative structures

**Goal**
Check whether the Q009 encoding can distinguish between synthetic worlds where “odd perfect like” structures are forced to exist and worlds where they are ruled out by construction.

**Setup**

* Construct two families of artificial multiplicative models:

  * **Family T_model**: integer like objects where the divisor sum function has forced exact solutions `sigma(n) = 2 * n` for some odd like entities, together with structural properties mimicking odd perfect candidates.

  * **Family F_model**: integer like objects where structural constraints ensure `sigma(n) != 2 * n` for all odd like entities, while maintaining broadly similar multiplicative behavior otherwise.

* For each model, define factorization and divisor sum summaries analogous to those used in Q009, together with evaluations of all constraints in a model specific analogue of `L_OPN`.

**Protocol**

1. For each model in Family T_model, build a regular state `m_Tmodel` in `M_009_reg` with divisor and constraint data for its “odd” sector; compute `Delta_sigma_min(m_Tmodel)`, `Delta_struct(m_Tmodel)`, and `Tension_OPN(m_Tmodel)`.

2. For each model in Family F_model, build a state `m_Fmodel` and compute the same observables.

3. Compare the distributions of `Tension_OPN` across the two families for admissible choices of encoding parameters.

**Metrics**

* Mean and variance of `Tension_OPN` over Family T_model versus Family F_model.
* Separation between the two distributions, for example by any simple distance metric on the nonnegative real line.
* Robustness of the separation under small admissible changes in the weight pair within `W_OPN`.

**Falsification conditions**

* If the encoding systematically fails to assign lower tension to Family T_model than to Family F_model across reasonable parameter sets, it is considered ineffective and rejected.
* If the encoding assigns systematically lower tension to clearly “no odd perfect” constructions than to “forced odd perfect” constructions, the misalignment indicates that the basic choice of observables or combination rule is flawed.

**Semantics implementation note**
The synthetic models and their observables are treated as discrete objects, aligned with the discrete semantics of Q009.

**Boundary note**
Again, falsifying a TU encoding is **not** solving the canonical statement. Success or failure on synthetic families only tests the quality of the encoding, not the reality of odd perfect numbers for actual integers.

## 7. AI and WFGY engineering spec

This block describes how Q009 can be used as an engineering module for AI systems within the WFGY framework, at the effective layer.

### 7.1 Training signals

Possible training signals include:

1. `signal_divisor_gap_profile`

   * Definition: a scalar derived from `Delta_sigma_min(m)` that penalizes configurations where the model implicitly treats odd integers as “too close” to being perfect without explicit justification.
   * Purpose: encourage the AI to track how large normalized divisor sum distances actually are, rather than assuming that exact equalities are likely.

2. `signal_structural_consistency_OPN`

   * Definition: a signal proportional to `Delta_struct(m)` whenever the model reasons about hypothetical odd perfect numbers.
   * Purpose: encourage internal states that respect known structural constraints from `L_OPN`.

3. `signal_world_split_OPN`

   * Definition: a stability signal that measures how consistently the model can maintain separate reasoning chains under “World T” and “World F” assumptions without mixing them.
   * Purpose: improve robustness when the AI is asked to explore both existence and nonexistence scenarios as deliberate counterfactuals.

### 7.2 Architectural patterns

Module patterns that can reuse Q009 components:

1. `DivisorTensionHead`

   * Role: given an internal representation of a number theoretic context, estimate a proxy for `Tension_OPN(m)`.
   * Interface:

     ```txt
     Input:  internal embeddings for statements about sigma(n),
             prime factors, and related constraints
     Output: scalar tension estimate, plus optional components
             Delta_sigma_min and Delta_struct
     ```

2. `ConstraintSaturationChecker_OPN`

   * Role: check whether the model’s current candidate arguments about odd perfect numbers respect the constraint library `L_OPN`.
   * Interface:

     ```txt
     Input:  structured representation of a candidate odd integer
             or a sketch proof
     Output: vector of scores indicating how many constraints are
             satisfied, nearly satisfied, or violated

### 7.3 Evaluation harness

An evaluation harness for AI systems augmented with Q009 modules:

1. **Task selection**

   * Choose a set of problems and expository tasks about perfect numbers and related multiplicative topics, including:

     * explaining known results about even perfect numbers,
     * summarizing constraints on hypothetical odd perfect numbers,
     * distinguishing between “known necessary conditions” and “speculative heuristics”.

2. **Conditions**

   * Baseline condition: model operates without Q009 specific modules.
   * TU condition: model uses `DivisorTensionHead` and `ConstraintSaturationChecker_OPN` as auxiliary guidance.

3. **Metrics**

   * Factual accuracy on known theorems and constraints.
   * Internal consistency: how often the model contradicts itself about known necessary conditions.
   * Clarity in separating what is proved, what is conjectured, and what is purely hypothetical.

### 7.4 60 second reproduction protocol

A minimal protocol to let external users experience the impact of Q009 encoding, without exposing any deep TU mechanisms.

* **Baseline setup**

  * Prompt: ask the AI to explain what perfect numbers are and whether any odd perfect numbers are known, without mentioning WFGY or tension.
  * Observation: record whether the explanation clearly separates the existence of even perfect numbers from the open status of odd perfect numbers, and whether it misstates any constraints.

* **TU encoded setup**

  * Prompt: ask the same question, but instruct the AI to:

    * treat the problem as a consistency_tension problem in a discrete state space,
    * explicitly mention “normalized distance between `sigma(n)` and `2 * n` for odd `n`”,
    * and discuss structural constraints from a finite library of necessary conditions.

  * Observation: record whether the answer is more precise about:

    * what is known,
    * what is conjectured,
    * how the various constraints fit together.

* **Comparison metric**

  * Use a simple rubric for:

    * correctness of statements,
    * clarity in describing open status,
    * explicit handling of constraints and search data.

* **What to log**

  * Both prompts and responses,
  * any auxiliary tension estimates computed by Q009 components,
  * any explicit references to structural constraints or normalized distances.

## 8. Cross problem transfer template

This block describes reusable components produced by Q009 and their direct reuse targets.

### 8.1 Reusable components produced by this problem

1. ComponentName: `OddPerfectTensionFunctional`

   * Type: functional

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: divisor_sum_summaries, factorization_summaries
     Output: tension_value (nonnegative scalar)
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * Inputs must encode consistent divisor sum and factorization data for a finite set of odd integers.
     * The functional uses the same normalized distance and structural gap definitions as in §§3.2–3.3.

2. ComponentName: `DivisorProfileDescriptor`

   * Type: observable

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: integer_configuration
     Output: profile_vector summarizing normalized distances
             dist_OPN(n) and related divisor statistics
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The configuration provides enough information to compute `sigma(n)` and normalized distances for the odd integers under consideration.

3. ComponentName: `ConstraintSaturationWorld_OPN`

   * Type: experiment_pattern

   * Minimal interface:

     ```txt
     Inputs: constraint_library L_OPN, search_horizon protocol
     Output: experiment_definition describing how to
             evaluate Delta_sigma_min, Delta_struct,
             and Tension_OPN across horizons
     ```

   * Preconditions:

     * The constraint library is finite and can be applied consistently to all odd integers in the search range.
     * The horizon protocol is monotone and data independent (for example, based on published search milestones).

### 8.2 Direct reuse targets

1. Q020 (structure of multiplicative functions)

   * Reused component: `DivisorProfileDescriptor`.
   * Why it transfers: many questions about multiplicative functions involve patterns of divisor sums or related quantities; the descriptor captures these patterns in a reusable way.
   * What changes: the observable is applied to broader classes of multiplicative functions, not just `sigma(n)`.

2. Q021 (extreme values of divisor sums)

   * Reused component: `OddPerfectTensionFunctional`.
   * Why it transfers: extreme behavior of `sigma(n)` relative to `n` can be modeled as a tension between observed growth and theoretical bounds.
   * What changes: the target equality `sigma(n) = 2 * n` is replaced by inequalities or different normalization factors, but the same structure is used.

3. Q023 (sparsity of special integer sets)

   * Reused component: `ConstraintSaturationWorld_OPN`.
   * Why it transfers: many special sets (for example, certain smooth numbers or special factorization classes) can be modeled using finite constraint libraries and tension between “search data” and “structural possibility”.
   * What changes: the constraint library and notion of “special” are adapted to the target set, but the horizon based experiment pattern remains.

## 9. TU roadmap and verification levels

This block describes the current verification level of Q009 and possible next steps.

### 9.1 Current levels

* **E_level: E1**

  * A coherent effective layer encoding for odd perfect numbers as a consistency_tension problem in a discrete state space has been specified.
  * Normalized distance observables, structural gap observables, and a combined tension functional have been defined.
  * Horizon semantics and completeness requirements for regular states are explicitly stated.

* **N_level: N1**

  * The narrative clearly distinguishes between:

    * existence versus nonexistence scenarios,
    * search data versus structural constraints,
    * what the tension functional is meant to summarize.

### 9.2 Next measurable step toward E2

To move from E1 to E2, at least one of the following should be implemented in practice:

1. Build a concrete prototype that, given published search data up to a horizon `B`, constructs states `m_B` in `M_009_reg` and computes `Delta_sigma_min(m_B)`, `Delta_struct(m_B)`, and `Tension_OPN(m_B)`, publishing the tension profiles as open data, together with a fully specified choice of `(w_sigma, w_struct)` from `W_OPN`.

2. Implement synthetic model families as in Experiment 2 and provide reproducible results showing how well Q009’s encoding distinguishes “forced existence” and “forced nonexistence” model worlds, again with fully specified encoding parameters.

Both steps operate only on observable summaries (factorization and divisor sums) and do not require revealing any deep TU generative rule.

### 9.3 Long term role in the TU program

In the long term, Q009 is expected to serve as:

* the canonical discrete consistency_tension problem in multiplicative number theory,
* a standard module for reasoning about whether highly constrained structures should exist at all,
* a bridge between number theoretic search experiments and formalized tension based narratives in AI systems.

## 10. Elementary but precise explanation

This block gives a nontechnical explanation aligned with the effective layer description.

Classically, perfect numbers are integers `n` such that the sum of all their positive divisors equals `2 * n`. Examples are `6` and `28`, both even. All known perfect numbers are even and follow a very specific pattern tied to Mersenne primes.

The odd perfect number problem asks a simple question:

> Could there be a perfect number that is odd?

Nobody has ever found one, and nobody has proved they cannot exist. This makes the question easy to state and very hard to answer.

In the Tension Universe view, we do not try to prove or disprove the existence directly. Instead, we:

* look at all odd numbers that have been checked up to some limit,
* record, for each, how far it is from being perfect, using the normalized difference between `sigma(n)` and `2 * n`,
* record, for each, how many of a fixed list of known structural conditions it satisfies; these conditions would all have to hold if an odd perfect number existed.

We then combine these two pieces of information into a single **tension score**:

* low tension means “in this range, the data and constraints fit reasonably well with the idea that an odd perfect number could exist” (for example, some odd `n` are very close to perfect and satisfy almost all structural conditions),
* high tension means “in this range, the data and constraints seem to resist the existence of such a number” (for example, no odd `n` is close to perfect, or all of them violate many structural conditions).

We then imagine two worlds:

* In a world where odd perfect numbers exist, as we explore more and more odd numbers, we would expect that at some horizons, there are candidates that get extremely close to perfect and satisfy almost all known constraints, and that the tension score occasionally drops into a low, stable band.

* In a world where no odd perfect number exists, we would expect that no matter how far we search, the normalized distance to perfect stays noticeably large, and the structural constraints cannot be made jointly compatible, so the tension score stays bounded away from zero.

This framework does not answer the existence question by itself. Instead, it gives us:

* a clear way to summarize search and structural information in each finite range,
* a way to test whether a particular encoding of that information behaves in a stable, interpretable way,
* reusable tools for other problems where “many constraints” and “no known examples” are the main features.

Q009 is therefore the prototype for discrete consistency_tension problems in Tension Universe, centered on one of the most famous open questions in multiplicative number theory.

## Tension Universe effective-layer footer

This page is part of the **WFGY / Tension Universe** S-problem collection.

This page should be read together with the following charters:

* [TU Effective Layer Charter](../Charters/TU_EFFECTIVE_LAYER_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Encoding and Fairness Charter](../Charters/TU_ENCODING_AND_FAIRNESS_CHARTER.md)
* [TU Tension Scale Charter](../Charters/TU_TENSION_SCALE_CHARTER.md)

### Scope of claims

* The goal of this document is to specify an **effective-layer encoding** of the named problem.
* It does not claim to prove or disprove the canonical statement in Section 1.
* It does not introduce any new theorem beyond what is already established in the cited literature.
* It should not be cited as evidence that the corresponding open problem has been solved.

### Effective-layer boundary

* All objects used here (state spaces `M_009`, observables, invariants, tension scores, counterfactual “worlds”) live at the effective layer.
* No step in this file gives a constructive mapping from raw experimental or simulation data into internal TU fields.
* No step exposes any deep TU generative rule or any first-principle axiom system.
* No field, label, constant or parameter defined in this file is allowed to silently encode the canonical truth value of Q009 as an uninterpreted bit.

### Encoding and fairness

* Admissible encoding classes, reference profiles, weight families and horizon protocols used in this page are constrained by the shared Tension Universe charters listed above.

* For every encoding family referenced here:

  * its definition, parameter ranges, admissible weight sets and reference families are fixed at the charter level before any problem specific evaluation;
  * these choices may depend on general physical or mathematical considerations and on public benchmark selections, but **not** on the unknown truth value of this specific problem;
  * no encoding is allowed to hide the canonical answer as an uninterpreted field, label or parameter.

* For every **concrete encoding instance** used on real data:

  * the choice of weights, thresholds, horizon sequence and model library is fixed **before** running the experiment;
  * once such an instance has been used on real data, its parameters are considered frozen;
  * changing those parameters defines a **new** encoding instance, which must be versioned and evaluated as a separate object;
  * post-hoc parameter tuning to make a specific benchmark or historical dataset look low tension is explicitly disallowed and counted as leaving the admissible class.

### Versioning and non-mutation policy

* This file defines the encoding class

  ```txt
  encoding_class_BH_MATH_ODDPERF_E1_v1
  ```

  with `Spec_version: 1` as recorded in the header metadata.

* The following changes are considered **semantic** and require a new spec version and, in general, a new encoding class name:

  * modifying the definition of `M_009`, `L_OPN`, `Delta_sigma_min`, `Delta_struct`, `DeltaS_OPN`, or `Tension_OPN`;
  * changing admissible weight sets such as `W_OPN`, or altering horizon protocols used in the experiments;
  * altering falsification conditions in a way that can change the outcome of previously valid experiments.

* The following changes are considered **non-semantic** and may be done without changing `Spec_version`, as long as they do not affect any computed tension value or experimental decision:

  * clarifying wording, fixing typos, improving examples while keeping all definitions exactly the same;
  * adding cross-references or citations that do not alter the scope of the claims;
  * tightening explanations in the elementary section without changing the underlying formal structure.

* Upgrades to the encoding (including run1 → run2 revisions) are interpreted as **versioned iterations** on the effective layer. They do not change any deep TU axioms and do not retroactively modify the behavior of past experiments that were executed under earlier spec versions.

### Tension scale and thresholds

* All mismatch terms `DeltaS_*` and tension functionals in this file are treated as **dimensionless or normalized quantities**, defined up to a fixed monotone rescaling specified in the TU Tension Scale Charter.
* Thresholds such as `epsilon_*`, `delta_*` and experiment cutoffs are always interpreted relative to that fixed scale.
* Changing the tension scale requires an explicit update of the TU Tension Scale Charter, not an edit of individual problem files.

### Falsifiability and experiments

* Experiments described in this document are **tests of TU encodings**, not tests of the underlying canonical problem itself.
* The rule “falsifying a TU encoding is not the same as solving the canonical statement” is understood to apply globally, even where it is not restated.
* When required observables cannot be reliably estimated in practice, the outcome of the corresponding experiment is recorded as “inconclusive”, not as confirmation.
* When experimental results conflict with the predictions of a particular encoding instance, the correct response is to update, retire, or replace that encoding within the TU charters, **not** to reinterpret the canonical mathematics.

### Interaction with established results

* All encodings and counterfactual worlds described here are required to respect known theorems and hard constraints in the relevant field.
* If a later analysis finds a concrete conflict with established results, the correct procedure is to update or retire the encoding under the TU charters, not to reinterpret those results.

### Program note

* This page is an experimental specification within the ongoing **WFGY / Tension Universe** research program.
* All structures and parameter choices are provisional and may be revised in future versions, subject to the constraints above.
* Upgrades to the encoding (including run1 → run2 revisions) are interpreted as versioned iterations on the effective layer. They do not change any deep TU axioms and do not retroactively modify the behavior of past experiments.
