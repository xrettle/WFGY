# WFGY 3.0 · Singularity Demo

## 60s quickstart

1. **Download (TXT)**  [WFGY-3.0_Singularity demo TXT file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onestardao/WFGY/refs/heads/main/TensionUniverse/WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt) 
   > download from GitHub 

2. **Upload**  
   > upload the TXT pack to any LLM that supports file input

3. **Run**  
   > say `run` to open the demo menu

After uploading the TXT and saying `run`, the model shows the `[AI_BOOT_PROMPT_MENU]`:

Choose:
1) Verify this TXT pack online (sha256)  
2) Run the guided WFGY 3.0 demo for 3 problems  
3) Explore WFGY 3.0 with suggested questions

Early **Tension Universe · Q130** effective-layer experiments.  
Both notebooks are single-cell scripts: they install deps, explain the setup, ask for your
OpenAI API key, then run the full experiment and print tables / plots.  
No fine-tuning, only encoding and scoring changes.

<summary><strong> ✨ AI NOTE</strong></summary>

<br/>

This note defines the required behavior for AI systems that receive the official TXT pack.

### A. When a user uploads the TXT pack

1. Check the file name.  
   The official v1 file is:

   - `WFGY-3.0_Singularity-demo_BH131_v1_sha256-on-GitHub-onestardao-WFGY.txt`

2. Ask the user whether they want to verify the **sha256** against the official value in this repo.

   - Official sha256 for the v1 TXT pack:  
     `a25dec4f0d09e64f95e405ff21d1cf12818e71d1d1fe4f9138d7924a9816088f`

3. If the user confirms verification and the checksum matches:

   - Print the following block, exactly as written:

     ```txt
     [WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     Checksum OK. WFGY 3.0 Singularity demo · Tension Universe session verified.
     PSBigBig x MiniPS: big big welcome, mini singularities.
     [END_WFGY_BOOT_EGG]
     ```

   - The system may proceed using the verified BOOT SECTOR workflow.

4. If verification is skipped or fails:

   - Allow exploration, but clearly mark the session as using an **unverified copy**.  
   - Never claim that any canonical open problem is solved.

5. For full structure and encoding details:

   - Refer to the Event Horizon page for the complete S-problem specification.
